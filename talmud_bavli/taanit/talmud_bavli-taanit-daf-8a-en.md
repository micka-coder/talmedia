### Part 1
<b>whose studies are hard as iron for him,</b> i.e., difficult to understand, this is <b>due to his</b> lack of familiarity with the <b>Mishna, which is not organized for him.</b> If the Mishna is unclear, any further study of Gemara is rendered all the more difficult, <b>as it is stated: “And does not whet [<i>kilkal</i>] the edge [<i>panim</i>]”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:10). As panim can also mean surface, this indicates that the surface, i.e., the basic statements of the Mishna, is corrupted. As stated previously, <i>kilkal</i> can also mean corrupted.

### Part 2
<b>What is his remedy?</b> He must <b>increase</b> the time he <b>sits</b> and studies, <b>as it is stated: “Then must he increase his strength”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:10). The last part of the verse: <b>“But wisdom is profitable to direct,”</b> means that <b>all the more so, if his</b> study of the <b>Mishna is organized for him from the beginning,</b> he will avoid this trouble.

### Part 3
That is <b>like this</b> practice <b>of Reish Lakish,</b> who <b>would review his studies forty times, corresponding to</b> the <b>forty days in which the Torah was given</b> to Moses at Sinai, <b>and</b> only afterward would he <b>go before Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> to study from his teacher. Similarly, <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava</b> would <b>review his learning twenty-four times, corresponding to</b> the twenty-four books in the <b>Torah, Prophets, and Writings,</b> i.e., the Bible, <b>and</b> only afterward <b>go before Rava</b> to study with him.

### Part 4
With regard to the aforementioned verse from Ecclesiastes, <b>Rava said: If you see a student whose studies are</b> as <b>difficult for him as iron,</b> this is <b>due to his teacher, who does not show him a friendly countenance,</b> but is overly strict with him. This practice inhibits the student’s learning, <b>as it is stated: “And it has not whetted the surface [<i>panim</i>]”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:10). As explained previously, <i>panim</i> can also mean countenance.

### Part 5
<b>What is the remedy</b> for this student? He must <b>increase</b> the number of <b>friends</b> he sends to the teacher to intercede <b>for him, as it is stated: “Then must he increase his strength.”</b> The term used for strength, <i>ḥayalim</i>, can also mean soldiers or colleagues. Nevertheless: <b>“But wisdom is profitable to direct,”</b> meaning that <b>all the more so</b> would he be spared this trouble <b>if his deeds</b> were properly <b>directed before his teacher from the beginning.</b>

### Part 6
§ The Gemara returns to the topic of rain. <b>And Rabbi Ami said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “If the serpent [<i>naḥash</i>] bites [<i>yishokh</i>] before it is charmed [<i>laḥash</i>], then the charmer has no advantage”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:11)? <b>If you see a generation</b> for whom <b>the heavens corrode [<i>meshatkhin</i>] like copper [<i>neḥoshet</i>],</b> which prevents them <b>from bringing down dew and rain,</b> this is <b>due to the lack of those who whisper quiet [<i>loḥashei leḥishot</i>]</b> prayers <b>in the generation.</b>

### Part 7
<b>What is their remedy?</b> They should <b>go to one who knows</b> how <b>to whisper</b> prayers in the proper manner, <b>as it is written: “Its noise tells concerning it”</b> (Job 36:33). As for the phrase: <b>“Then the charmer has no advantage,”</b> this is referring to <b>one who is able to whisper</b> his prayers correctly <b>and yet does not whisper</b> them correctly. In this case, of <b>what benefit to him</b> is his ability to pray?

### Part 8
<b>And if he whispered</b> his prayers <b>and</b> yet <b>was not answered, what is his remedy?</b> He should <b>go to</b> the most <b>pious individual of the generation, and</b> this pious individual will <b>increase</b> his <b>prayers on his behalf, as it is stated</b> one verse earlier: <b>“And He has commanded it due to imploring”</b> (Job 36:32). <b>And “imploring”</b> means <b>nothing other</b> than <b>prayer, as it is stated: “Therefore, do not pray you for this nation, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither implore Me”</b> (Jeremiah 7:16).

### Part 9
<b>And if he whispered</b> his prayers for rain, <b>and</b> his prayers were <b>successful,</b> i.e., rain fell as he requested, <b>and he becomes prideful</b> as a result, <b>he brings anger into the world, as it is stated: “The cattle [<i>mikne</i>] also [<i>af</i> ] concerning the rising storm [<i>al oleh</i>]”</b> (Job 36:33). This verse can be read homiletically as: Anger [<i>af</i> ] is acquired [<i>mikne</i>] by one who raises [<i>al oleh</i>] his pride.

### Part 10
Following the same interpretation of this verse, <b>Rava said:</b> If there are <b>two Torah scholars who live in one city, and they are not courteous with one another in</b> their discussions of <b><i>halakha</i>, they arouse anger</b> upon the world <b>and cause it to rise up, as it is stated: “Anger is acquired by one who raises his pride.”</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara cites another interpretation of the aforementioned verse. <b>Reish Lakish said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “If the snake bites before it is charmed, then the charmer has no advantage”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:11)? <b>In the future, all the animals will gather together and come to the snake and say to him: A lion mauls</b> its prey <b>and eats</b> it; <b>a wolf tears apart</b> its prey <b>and eats</b> it; but <b>you, what pleasure do you have</b> when you bite a person, as you are incapable of eating him? The snake will <b>say to them: “The charmer has no advantage.”</b> The Hebrew phrase for snake charmer literally means the master of the tongue, and therefore the snake is saying that he has a more difficult question: What pleasure does a slanderer receive, as he inflicts more harm for which he obtains no physical enjoyment.

### Part 12
<b>Rabbi Ami said: A person’s prayer is heard only if he places his soul in his palm,</b> i.e., one must submit his entire soul with sincerity in his outstretched hands as he prays, <b>as it is stated: “Let us lift up our heart with our hands”</b> (Lamentations 3:41). The Gemara raises an objection: <b>Is that so? But Shmuel</b> once <b>established for himself an interpreter</b> to teach in public, <b>and interpreted homiletically</b> the verse: <b>“But they beguiled Him with their mouth and lied to Him with their tongue, for their heart was not steadfast with Him, neither were they faithful to His covenant”</b> (Psalms 78:36–37), <b>and nevertheless</b> the psalm continues: <b>“But He, being full of compassion, forgives iniquity,</b> and does not destroy” (Psalms 78:38). This indicates that all prayers are accepted, even if they lack sincerity.

### Part 13
The Gemara responds: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>here</b> Rabbi Ami is referring <b>to an individual</b> who prays without sincerity and consequently his prayer goes unheard, whereas <b>there</b> Shmuel is saying that when one prays <b>with</b> the <b>community,</b> even if his prayers are deficient, they are accepted in the merit of the congregation.

### Part 14
<b>Rabbi Ami</b> further <b>said: Rain falls only due to faithful people, as it is stated: “Truth springs out of the earth, and righteousness has looked down from heaven”</b> (Psalms 85:12). When “truth springs out of the earth,” i.e., if people are faithful, they will find that “righteousness,” in the form of rain “has looked down from heaven.”

### Part 15
<b>And Rabbi Ami said: Come and see how great</b> the <b>faithful people are,</b> and how God assists them. <b>From where</b> is it derived? <b>From</b> the story of the <b>marten [<i>ḥulda</i>] and</b> the <b>pit.</b> Once a young man saved a girl who had fallen into a pit. After rescuing her they swore to remain faithful to each other, and they declared the pit and a passing marten their witnesses. As time went by the young man forgot his vow and married another woman. They had two children, both of whom died tragically, one by falling into a pit and the other when he was bitten by a marten. Their unusual deaths led the young man to realize his error and he returned to the first woman. <b>And if this</b> is the outcome for one <b>who believes in</b> signs from <b>a pit and a marten, all the more so</b> for <b>one who has faith in the Holy One, Blessed be He.</b>

### Part 16
§ <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Whoever is exacting with himself,</b> by striving to act righteously in every way on earth <b>below, he is judged in an exact manner</b> in Heaven <b>above,</b> in order to improve him further still, <b>as it is stated: “Truth springs out of the earth, and righteousness has looked down from heaven”</b> (Psalms 85:12). <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said</b> that this idea is derived <b>from here: “And Your wrath is according to the fear that is due to You”</b> (Psalms 90:11). The level of God’s wrath correlates with the offender’s fear of God.

### Part 17
<b>Reish Lakish said</b> that this principle is derived <b>from here: “You took him away who joyfully performed righteousness, those who remembered You in Your ways, behold You were wroth, and we sinned, upon them have we stayed of old, that we might be saved”</b> (Isaiah 64:4). This verse also teaches that God displays wrath specifically due to the transgressions of those who are accustomed to acting righteously. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said</b> concerning the same verse: <b>Whoever is joyful in</b> the <b>suffering</b> that comes upon him <b>brings salvation to the world [<i>olam</i>], as it is stated: “Upon them have we stayed of old [<i>olam</i>], that we might be saved.”</b>

### Part 18
§ Returning to the topic of rain, <b>Reish Lakish said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And He will close up the heavens”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:17)? This verse teaches that <b>when the heavens are closed up from bringing down dew and rain,</b> this is <b>similar to a woman who has the pangs of labor and</b> yet <b>does not give birth,</b> as the heavens themselves suffer from their inability to bring down rain and dew. <b>And this is what Reish Lakish said in the name of bar Kappara: Closing up is stated with regard to rains, and closing up is</b> likewise <b>stated with regard to a woman.</b>
