### Part 1
<b>the priest</b> tasked with removing the ashes from the circular heap <b>was never indolent in removing the ashes.</b>

### Part 2
After the ashes were cleared to the middle of the altar, the priests <b>began raising logs</b> onto the altar in order <b>to assemble the arrangement</b> of wood on which the offerings were burned. The <i>tanna</i> asks: <b>And is</b> wood from <b>all the trees fit for the arrangement?</b> The <i>tanna</i> replies: Wood from <b>all the trees is fit for the arrangement, except for</b> wood <b>from</b> the <b>vine and from</b> the <b>olive</b> tree, <b>but</b> the priests <b>were accustomed</b> to assemble the arrangement <b>with</b> wood from <b>these</b> trees: <b>With young branches of</b> the <b>fig</b> tree, <b>of</b> the <b>nut</b> tree, <b>and of pinewood.</b>

### Part 3
The priest who removed the ashes then <b>assembled the large arrangement</b> of wood upon which the daily offering and the sacrificial portions of the other offerings are burned. It was assembled <b>on the eastern</b> side of the altar, <b>and its opening</b> was <b>on the eastern</b> side of the altar, <b>and the inner end of</b> the <b>logs would touch the circular heap</b> of ashes. <b>And there was space between the logs,</b> in which the priests placed twigs, <b>as they would ignite the kindling [<i>ha’alita</i>] from there,</b> so that the fire would spread to the logs.

### Part 4
The priests <b>selected from</b> among the logs that were <b>there fine</b> logs from <b>fig trees,</b> as when this type of wood was burned it would become coals rather than ashes. The priest who removed the ashes then <b>assembled the second arrangement</b> of wood, from which the coals were taken to the golden altar in the Sanctuary <b>for</b> the burning of <b>the incense.</b> The second arrangement was assembled <b>next to the southwestern</b> corner of the altar and was <b>removed from the corner toward the north</b> side of the altar by a distance of <b>four cubits.</b>

### Part 5
The second arrangement was assembled <b>of</b> an amount of wood <b>estimated</b> to produce <b>five <i>se’a</i> of coals. And on Shabbat,</b> it was assembled <b>of</b> an amount of wood <b>estimated</b> to produce <b>eight <i>se’a</i> of coals, as there</b> the priests <b>would place</b> the <b>two bowls of frankincense that</b> accompanied <b>the shewbread</b> and that were burned on the altar on Shabbat. With regard to <b>the limbs and the fats that were not consumed</b> during the time <b>from the</b> previous <b>evening,</b> the priests would <b>return them to the</b> large <b>arrangement</b> to be burned. <b>And</b> the priests <b>kindled</b> those <b>two arrangements with fire</b> and <b>descended</b> from the altar. <b>And they</b> then <b>came to the Chamber of Hewn Stone,</b> where they would conduct the second lottery in order to determine who would perform the subsequent rites.

### Part 6
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that sometimes there was as much as three hundred <i>kor</i> of ashes upon the circular heap in the middle of the altar. <b>Rava said:</b> This is <b>an exaggeration.</b> The mishna merely means that the heap contained a large quantity of ashes, not that it reached that actual amount. Similarly, the mishna states (30a) that before slaughtering the daily offering the priests <b>gave</b> the lamb selected for <b>the daily offering</b> water <b>to drink in cup of gold,</b> so that it would be easier to flay it after it was slaughtered. With regard to this mishna, <b>Rava said:</b> This is <b>an exaggeration,</b> as the priests would not give the animal to drink from an actual golden vessel.

### Part 7
In this connection, <b>Rabbi Ami says:</b> In certain instances, the <b>Torah spoke</b> employing <b>exaggerated [<i>havai</i>] language,</b> the <b>prophets spoke</b> employing <b>exaggerated language,</b> and <b>the Sages spoke</b> employing <b>exaggerated language.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara cites examples for this statement: The <b>Torah spoke</b> employing <b>exaggerated language, as it is written:</b> “Hear, Israel: You are passing over the Jordan this day, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than you, <b>cities great and fortified up to heaven”</b> (Deuteronomy 9:1). Does it <b>enter your mind</b> to say that the cities were literally fortified <b>up to heaven? Rather,</b> this is <b>an exaggeration.</b>

### Part 9
Likewise, <b>the Sages spoke</b> employing <b>exaggerated language,</b> as in <b>this</b> example <b>that we stated</b> with regard to the <b>circular heap</b> of ashes, <b>and</b> in the description: The priests <b>gave</b> the lamb selected for <b>the daily offering</b> water <b>to drink in a cup of gold.</b>

### Part 10
The <b>prophets spoke</b> employing <b>exaggerated language, as it is written</b> with regard to the coronation of King Solomon: “And all the people of the land came up after him, and the people <b>piped with pipes,</b> and rejoiced with great joy, <b>so that the earth rent with the sound of them”</b> (I Kings 1:40). The verse merely means that the sound was very great, not that it actually caused the earth to split.

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Yannai bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: In three instances, the Sages spoke in exaggerated language, and these are those</b> instances: With regard to the <b>circular heap</b> of ashes on the altar, with regard to the <b>vine, and</b> with regard to the <b>Curtain</b> that separated the Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies, as explained below.

### Part 12
The Gemara notes that Shmuel’s statement serves <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rava, as we learned</b> in a mishna: The priests <b>gave</b> the lamb selected for <b>the daily offering</b> water <b>to drink in a cup of gold, and Rava said:</b> This is <b>an exaggeration.</b> Shmuel <b>teaches us</b> that in <b>these</b> three instances, <b>yes,</b> the Sages employed exaggerated language, but <b>there,</b> in the case of the golden cup, it is <b>not</b> an exaggeration, as even the cup from which the lamb was given to drink was actually made of gold. This is because <b>there is no poverty in a place of wealth,</b> i.e., the Temple is a place of wealth, where one must act in a lavish manner.

### Part 13
The Gemara details the three instances with regard to which Shmuel states that the Sages employed exaggerated language: The case of the <b>circular heap</b> of ashes is <b>that which we stated</b> above. The case of the <b>vine</b> is <b>as it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Middot</i> 3:8): <b>A gold</b> ornament in the form of a <b>vine stood at the entrance to the Sanctuary, and</b> it <b>hung upon posts. And whoever would donate</b> an ornamental gold <b>leaf,</b>
