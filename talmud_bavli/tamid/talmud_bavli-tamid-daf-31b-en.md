### Part 1
<b>The first</b> priest stood <b>with the head and with the</b> right hind <b>leg</b> of the animal. Since it was more significant, <b>the head</b> was <b>in his right</b> hand, <b>and its nose</b> was turned <b>toward the</b> priest’s <b>arm. Its horns</b> were <b>between his fingers,</b> and <b>the place of its slaughter</b> was <b>above, and the fats were placed upon it,</b> to conceal the bloody place of slaughter. <b>The right</b> hind <b>leg</b> was <b>in his left</b> hand, <b>and</b> the outer <b>side</b> of the leg, from which <b>its hide</b> was flayed, rather than the side on which the incision was made, was facing <b>out. The second</b> priest stood <b>with</b> the <b>two forelegs.</b> He held the <b>right</b> foreleg <b>in his right</b> hand <b>and</b> the <b>left</b> foreleg <b>in his left</b> hand, <b>and</b> the outer <b>side</b> of the leg, from which <b>its hide</b> was flayed, was facing <b>out.</b>

### Part 2
<b>The third</b> priest stood <b>with the haunch and the</b> left hind <b>leg.</b> He held <b>the haunch in his right</b> hand, <b>and the tail</b> was <b>hanging between his fingers, and the finger-</b>like protrusion <b>of the liver and the two kidneys</b> were <b>with it.</b> He held <b>the left</b> hind <b>leg in his left</b> hand, <b>and</b> the outer <b>side</b> of the leg, from which <b>its hide</b> was flayed, was facing <b>out. The fourth</b> priest stood <b>with the breast and with the cud,</b> with <b>the breast in his right</b> hand <b>and the cud in his left</b> hand, <b>and its</b> two <b>ribs</b> were attached to the cud <b>between his two fingers. The fifth</b> priest stood <b>with</b> the <b>two flanks;</b> the <b>right</b> flank was <b>in his right</b> hand <b>and</b> the <b>left</b> flank <b>in his left</b> hand, <b>and</b> the outer <b>side</b> was facing <b>out. The sixth</b> priest stood <b>with the innards, which</b> were <b>placed in a vessel, and</b> the <b>lower legs</b> were placed <b>atop them from above.</b>

### Part 3
<b>The seventh</b> priest stood <b>with the fine flour</b> of the meal offering that accompanies the daily offering. <b>The eighth</b> priest stood <b>with the griddle-cake</b> offering sacrificed daily by the High Priest, half in the morning and half in the evening. <b>The ninth</b> priest stood <b>with the wine</b> for the libations that accompany the daily offering. The nine priests <b>went and placed</b> the items they were carrying on the area <b>from halfway</b> up <b>the ramp and below,</b> in the lower portion of the ramp, <b>on the west</b> side of the ramp, <b>and they salted</b> the limbs and the meal offering. <b>And they descended and came to the Chamber of Hewn Stone to recite</b> the morning <b><i>Shema</i></b> and the other texts that they would recite, as explained at the beginning of the next chapter.

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that the priests would bind the lamb for the daily offering. With regard to this procedure, the Sages <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The animal’s <b>foreleg and</b> hind <b>leg</b> are bound together, <b>as</b> in the <b>binding of Isaac, son of Abraham.</b>

### Part 5
The mishna teaches that the priests <b>would not tie the lamb</b> by fastening all four of its legs together. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The Gemara answers: This is a matter of dispute between <b>Rav Huna and Rav Ḥisda. One</b> of these Sages <b>said:</b> The animal is not tied <b>because</b> this would constitute <b>degradation of sacred items; and</b> the other <b>one said</b> that the animal is not tied <b>because that</b> method is the one adopted in pagan worship, and is therefore considered to be <b>walking in the statutes of the nations,</b> and the verse states: “You shall not walk in their statutes” (Leviticus 18:3).

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between</b> these opinions? The Gemara answers: There is a difference <b>between</b> them in a case <b>where</b> one <b>ties</b> the animal <b>with silk [<i>beshira’ei</i>],</b> which would be considered to be treating the offering in the manner of the nations, but it is not degrading. <b>Alternatively,</b> these opinions differ with regard to a case where the animal is tied <b>with a thread of gold.</b> As in the case of the silk, tying the animal with gold would be considered to be treating the offering in the manner of the nations, but it is not a degradation.

### Part 7
§ The mishna teaches that the innards were rinsed on marble tables in the slaughterhouse in the Temple. With regard to these tables, <b>we learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Shekalim</i> 17b) that there <b>were thirteen tables in the Temple. Eight</b> of them were fashioned <b>from marble</b> and were located <b>in the slaughterhouse,</b> north of the altar, <b>where</b> the priests would slaughter the offerings of the most sacred order. <b>Upon these</b> tables <b>they would wash the innards</b> of the offerings, as the cool marble preserved the freshness of the meat.

### Part 8
There were <b>two</b> more tables <b>on the western</b> side <b>of the ramp,</b> south of the altar, <b>one of marble and one of silver. On</b> the table <b>of marble</b> the priests would <b>place the limbs</b> before they would bring them up to the altar. <b>And on</b> the table <b>of silver</b> they would place the ninety-three <b>service vessels</b> brought out from the Chamber of Vessels each morning for the services of that day.

### Part 9
The mishna continues: <b>And in the Entrance Hall</b> there were <b>two</b> tables <b>on</b> its <b>inside, near the opening to the Temple, one of silver and one of gold. On</b> the table <b>of silver</b> the priests would <b>place the shewbread before its entrance</b> to the Sanctuary, after it was baked on Shabbat eve. <b>And on</b> the table <b>of gold</b> they would place the old shewbread <b>upon its exit</b> from the Sanctuary, to be divided among the priests.

### Part 10
The shewbread was not placed on a silver table upon its exit from the Sanctuary, <b>as</b> one <b>promotes in</b> matters of <b>sanctity and</b> one <b>does not demote.</b> Since in the interim the shewbread had been placed on the golden Table for the shewbread inside the Sanctuary, upon its removal it was not placed on anything other than a golden table. <b>And</b> lastly, there was <b>one</b> table <b>of gold inside</b> the Sanctuary. This was the Table for the shewbread, <b>upon which the shewbread always</b> rested (see Exodus 25:23–30).

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>Since</b> there is a principle that <b>there</b> may be <b>no poverty in a place of wealth,</b> i.e., the Temple must always be run in a lavish manner, why did they <b>fashion</b> any tables <b>of marble? Let them fashion</b> all the tables <b>of silver,</b> due to the grandeur of the Temple, or <b>let them fashion</b> them all <b>of gold. Rav Ḥinnana says in the name of Rabbi Asi, and Rabbi Asi</b> says <b>in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak:</b> Gold and silver tables are unfit for the sacrificial limbs <b>because</b> metal <b>scalds.</b> Unlike marble, metal can become very hot in the sun, and this might cause the sacrificial limbs to deteriorate.

### Part 12
§ The mishna teaches that the daily offering <b>of the morning was slaughtered at the northwest corner</b> of the altar, in the first ring of the second row from the south, which is called the second ring, whereas the daily offering of the afternoon was slaughtered at the northeast corner of the altar, at the second ring. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rav Ḥisda said: As the verse states,</b> with regard to the daily offering: “This is the offering made by fire that you shall bring to the Lord: Lambs of the first year without blemish, <b>two by day,</b> for a continual burnt offering” (Numbers 28:3). The phrase “two by day” indicates that the lamb must be slaughtered <b>opposite</b> the light of <b>the day.</b> Since Eretz Yisrael is north of the equator, the sun is always in the southern part of the sky. The first ring, then, is always in the long shadow of the altar, and only the second ring falls under direct sunlight.

### Part 13
<b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, that the phrase <b>“two by day”</b> teaches that the lamb must be slaughtered <b>opposite</b> the light of <b>the day.</b> The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>Do you say</b> that this means <b>opposite</b> the light of <b>the day, or</b> does it <b>only</b> mean that two lambs must be sacrificed for the <b>obligation of</b> each <b>day?</b> The <i>baraita</i> answers that <b>when</b> the verse <b>states: “One lamb you shall sacrifice in the morning, and the other lamb you shall sacrifice in the afternoon”</b> (Numbers 28:4), <b>the obligation of</b> each <b>day is</b> thereby <b>stated</b> explicitly. <b>How,</b> then, <b>do I realize</b> the meaning of <b>“two by day”?</b> This teaches that the lamb must be slaughtered <b>opposite</b> the light of <b>the day.</b>

### Part 14
The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>How so,</b> i.e., how can this principle be applied to both the morning and the afternoon offerings? The <b>daily offering of the morning was slaughtered opposite</b> the <b>northwest corner</b> of the altar, <b>on</b> the <b>second ring,</b> across from the sun, which rises in the east. <b>And</b> the daily offering <b>of the afternoon was slaughtered opposite</b> the <b>northeast corner</b> of the altar, <b>on</b> the fourth ring of the second row, also called the <b>second ring,</b> again across from the sun, which is located in the west in the afternoon.

### Part 15
§ With regard to the position of the sun, the Gemara relates that <b>Alexander of Macedon asked the Elders of the Negev</b> about <b>ten matters. He said to them:</b>
