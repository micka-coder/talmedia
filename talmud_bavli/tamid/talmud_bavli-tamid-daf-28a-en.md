<b>Peace be upon you.</b> If he would not reply, <b>it was evident that he</b> was <b>sleeping.</b> The man of the Temple Mount would therefore <b>strike him with his staff, and he</b> even <b>had license to burn</b> the watchman’s <b>garment,</b> in order to discipline him. <b>And those</b> overhearing the watchman being rebuked would <b>say</b> to one another: <b>What is</b> that <b>sound in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard?</b> It is the <b>sound of a Levite</b> being <b>flogged and</b> having <b>his clothing burned, as he was</b> caught <b>sleeping during</b> his <b>watch. Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: Once,</b> the supervisors <b>found my mother’s brother sleeping</b> on his watch, <b>and they burned his garment.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says: When Rabbi Yoḥanan would reach this mishna</b> in his studies, he <b>would say this: The early</b> generations <b>were praiseworthy, as they meted out judgment even in</b> the case of an offense caused by <b>unavoidable sleep;</b> and <b>all the more so</b> would they mete out judgment <b>in</b> the case of offenses that were <b>not</b> caused by <b>unavoidable sleep.</b>

### Part 3
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: Which</b> way of life <b>is an upright path that a person should select for himself;</b> what should be his guiding principle? One <b>should love admonition, for as long as</b> statements of <b>admonition</b> from the wise are heard <b>in the world, pleasantness comes into the world, goodness and blessing come into the world, and evil departs from the world, as it is stated: “But to those who admonish shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them”</b> (Proverbs 24:25). <b>And some say:</b> The path one <b>should</b> select is to <b>adhere to utmost faithfulness</b> in business and interpersonal relations, <b>as it is stated: “My eyes are upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with Me;</b> he who walks in a way of integrity, he shall serve Me” (Psalms 101:6).

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: Anyone who rebukes another for the sake of Heaven is privileged to</b> dwell in <b>the portion of the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “He that rebukes a man shall be behind Me”</b> (Proverbs 28:23), i.e., with Me. <b>Moreover,</b> the heavenly court <b>extends over him a cord of</b> divine <b>grace, as it is stated</b> in the same verse: <b>“He will find more favor than he who flatters with the tongue.”</b>

### Part 5
§ The mishna teaches (26a): If one <b>found</b> the bathroom door <b>closed, he would know</b> that there was a person there. The mishna then describes the commencement of the daily service in the Temple: <b>Whoever wants to remove</b> the ashes <b>from the altar</b> rises early and immerses himself before the appointed priest arrives. The Gemara objects: <b>This</b> mishna <b>itself</b> is <b>difficult. You</b> first <b>said: Whoever wants to remove</b> the ashes <b>from the altar rises early and immerses</b> himself <b>before the appointed</b> priest <b>arrives. Evidently, the matter</b> of determining who removes the ashes <b>is not dependent upon a lottery;</b> rather, whoever is ready first is entitled to remove the ashes. Otherwise, only the one selected would then immerse. <b>But afterward,</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> that the appointed priest says to the other priests: Whoever immersed <b>may come and participate in the lottery. Evidently, the matter is dependent upon a lottery.</b> How can this contradiction be resolved?

### Part 6
<b>Abaye said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> when the mishna indicates that whoever is ready first is entitled to remove the ashes, it is describing the procedure <b>before</b> the Sages enacted the <b>ordinance</b> of a lottery. <b>There,</b> when the mishna states that the appointed priest conducts a lottery, it is describing the procedure <b>after</b> they enacted the <b>ordinance.</b>

### Part 7
<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Yoma</i> 22a): <b>Initially,</b> the practice was as follows: <b>Whoever wants to remove</b> the ashes <b>from the altar removes</b> them. <b>When there are many</b> priests who wish to perform that task, the matter is determined by a race: The priests <b>run and ascend on the ramp</b> leading to the top of the altar. <b>Any</b> priest <b>who precedes the other</b> and reaches <b>within four cubits</b> of the top of the altar first <b>is privileged</b> to remove the ashes. If <b>two</b> priests <b>were equal</b> and neither preceded the other, <b>the appointed</b> priest <b>says to them: Raise</b> your <b>fingers,</b> and a lottery is performed.

### Part 8
<b>And what</b> fingers <b>do they extend</b> for the lottery? They may extend <b>one or two</b> fingers. The lottery was then conducted when the priests chose an arbitrary number, after which the appointee counted the raised fingers of the priests, who stood in a circle. He would go around the circle counting the fingers until he reached the chosen number, and the priest at whom the count ended won the lottery. <b>And</b> the priests <b>do not extend a thumb in the Temple,</b> as using the thumb might enable someone to manipulate the lottery. As the count progressed, a priest could calculate the result and surreptitiously extend his thumb and an additional finger. Since there is separation between the thumb and the forefinger it might appear as though they belonged to two different priests, and in this manner one could cause the lottery to conclude with a different priest.

### Part 9
The mishna continues: That used to be the procedure, but <b>an incident</b> occurred in which <b>two</b> priests <b>were equal</b> as they were <b>running and ascending on the ramp; and one of them shoved the other</b> and he fell, <b>and his leg was broken. And when the court saw that</b> people <b>were coming to</b> potential <b>danger, they instituted that</b> the priests <b>would remove</b> the ashes <b>from the altar only by</b> means of <b>a lottery.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Rava said:</b> Both <b>this</b> clause, which states that to remove the ashes the priests must rise early and be prepared, <b>and that</b> clause, which states that a lottery is conducted, are describing the procedure <b>after the ordinance. And this</b> is what the mishna <b>is teaching: Whoever wants to come and to participate in the lottery rises early and immerses before the appointed</b> priest <b>arrives</b> to conduct the lottery among those priests who are ready to participate.

### Part 11
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> At some time near dawn the appointed priest <b>took the key</b> that was kept beneath a marble tablet set in the floor of the Chamber of the Hearth <b>and opened</b> with it <b>the wicket [<i>hapishpesh</i>]</b> in the gate of the Chamber of the Hearth. <b>And he entered</b> through the wicket <b>from the Chamber of the Hearth to the</b> Temple <b>courtyard; and the priests</b> of the patrilineal family <b>entered after him, and two torches of fire</b> were <b>in their hands,</b> to light the way.

### Part 12
The priests <b>divided into two groups; these</b> priests would <b>walk along the portico</b> that surrounded the Temple courtyard, starting in the <b>direction of east, and those</b> priests would <b>walk along the portico</b> starting in the <b>direction</b> of <b>west.</b>The priests would ensure that all the service vessels were in place, ready for use in the daily service. Both groups <b>would continue inspecting</b> the vessels <b>until they reached the place</b> where the Chamber of <b>the Preparer of the</b> High Priest’s daily <b>Griddle-Cake</b> Offering was located. When <b>they reached</b> that place, <b>these</b> priests <b>and those</b> priests <b>said</b> to each other: It is <b>well; all is well,</b> and all the vessels are in place. <b>They</b> then <b>set the preparer of</b> the <b>griddle-cake</b> offering <b>to prepare</b> the <b>griddle-cake</b> offering.

### Part 13
The priest <b>who won</b> the lottery <b>to remove</b> the ashes <b>from the altar shall</b> then <b>remove</b> the ashes. <b>And</b> the other priests <b>say</b> to him: <b>Be careful that you do not touch the vessel</b> with which you perform the rite <b>until you sanctify your hands and your feet from the Basin,</b> as a priest may not perform any service in the Temple before sanctifying his hands and feet. The priests would continue their reminders: <b>The coal pan</b> with which the ashes are removed <b>is placed in</b> the <b>corner between the ramp and the altar, on the western</b> side <b>of</b> the <b>ramp.</b>

### Part 14
<b>No person would enter with</b> the priest who was removing the ashes, as it was permitted to enter the area between the Entrance Hall of the Sanctuary and the altar only when performing the Temple service. <b>And</b> there was <b>no lamp in his hand</b> when he went to fetch the coal pan. <b>Rather, he would walk by the light of the arrangement</b> of wood on the altar, upon which the portions of the offerings sacrificed the previous day were burned during the night. The other priests <b>would not see him,</b> as the altar hid him from their sight,
