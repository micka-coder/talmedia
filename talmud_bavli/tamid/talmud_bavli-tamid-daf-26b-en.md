### Part 1
§ The mishna teaches that <b>the Chamber of Avtinas and the Chamber of the Spark</b> were upper stories. Concerning this, <b>a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>Were</b> these halls <b>actual upper stories? Or perhaps they were</b> merely very <b>tall,</b> built upon pillars, and therefore were <b>like upper stories.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara explains: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna that discusses the seven gates to the Temple courtyard (<i>Middot</i> 1:5): There were three gates <b>that were in the north,</b> and the first of these was the <b>Gate of the Spark.</b> It <b>was like a portico [<i>akhsadra</i>], and</b> there was <b>an upper story built atop it,</b> where the honor guard stood, <b>with the priests watching from above,</b> in the upper story; <b>and the Levites</b> would keep watch <b>from below. And</b> the hall <b>had an entrance toward the non-sacred</b> area of the Temple Mount. This mishna indicates that the Chamber of the Spark was an actual upper story.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters,</b> that the priests and Levites kept watch on different stories, derived? This is derived from a verse, <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states that God said to Aaron: “And your brethren also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, you shall bring near with you, <b>that they may accompany you and serve you”</b> (Numbers 18:2). <b>The verse is speaking of</b> the Levites accompanying Aaron in <b>your,</b> i.e., Aaron’s, <b>service</b> of keeping watch in the Temple, which is the only service performed by both priests and Levites. Since the verse speaks of the watch of the Levites only as an accompaniment to the watch of the priests, the Levites do not keep watch from above like the priests, but only from below.

### Part 4
The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>Do you say</b> that <b>the verse speaks of</b> the Levites’ accompanying the priests in <b>your service,</b> of the priests keeping watch, <b>or</b> is it <b>only</b> stating that the Levites should accompany the priests <b>through their</b> own <b>service</b> of bearing the sacred vessels? The <i>baraita</i> explains that <b>when</b> the verse <b>states: “And they shall accompany you, and they shall keep</b> the watch of the Tent of Meeting” (Numbers 18:4), this is referring to keeping watch <b>of all</b> the Temple’s <b>vessels and all its service,</b> and consequently <b>their</b> own <b>service</b> of bearing the sacred vessels <b>is</b> already <b>stated. How,</b> then, <b>do I realize</b> the meaning of the previous verse: <b>“That they may accompany you and serve you”</b> (Numbers 18:2)? <b>The verse is speaking of</b> the Levites accompanying the priests in <b>your service,</b> of the priests keeping watch in the Temple. <b>How so?</b> The <b>priests keep watch from above, and</b> the <b>Levites</b> accompany them <b>from below.</b>

### Part 5
§ With regard to the third place in which the priests would keep watch, the mishna states: In <b>the Chamber of the Hearth</b> the ceiling was round like a <b>cupola, and it was a large hall.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>But was there</b> only <b>one watchman in the Chamber of the Hearth? And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a mishna (<i>Middot</i> 1:7): <b>The Chamber of the Hearth had two gates; one,</b> on the north side, was <b>open to the rampart, and one,</b> on the south side, was <b>open to the courtyard. Rabbi Yehuda said: This</b> gate <b>that was open to the courtyard had a small wicket</b> in the door of the gate, <b>through which</b> the priests would <b>enter</b> in order <b>to examine the courtyard</b> and ensure that everything was in order. The Chamber of the Hearth had two gates, and therefore there should have been two watchmen there. <b>Abaye said: Since</b> the two gates <b>stood next to each other,</b> i.e., directly opposite one another, it <b>was sufficient for them</b> to be watched <b>by one watchman,</b> who could <b>look here and look there.</b>

### Part 7
§ The mishna teaches that the Chamber of the Hearth was <b>surrounded</b> by <b>rows of stone</b> that protruded from the walls and that served as benches. The Gemara asks: <b>What are</b> these <b>rows</b> of stone? They are rows of <b>chiseled stones by which</b> the priests <b>ascend to</b> another row of <b>stone,</b> where they could lie down. The Gemara asks: <b>And would they split</b> the <b>stones</b> in the process of building the Temple? <b>But isn’t it written: “For the Temple, when it was being built,</b> was built <b>of whole stone</b> made ready at the quarry; and there was neither hammer nor ax nor any tool of iron heard in the Temple, while it was being built” (I Kings 6:7)?

### Part 8
<b>Abaye said:</b> It was prohibited to use iron implements to cut the stones only inside the Temple area. In this case it was permitted to have chiseled stones, <b>as</b> the builders <b>prepared</b> the stones in another location. <b>And</b> the builders <b>initially brought small stones and large stones</b> with which to build the Temple, <b>as it is written:</b> “And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, <b>stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits”</b> (I Kings 7:10). Accordingly, the larger stones were used for the lower tier, while the smaller stones were for the higher tier, forming protruding benches upon which the priests could sleep.

### Part 9
The mishna teaches that <b>the elders of the patrilineal family</b> that would serve in the Temple the following day would <b>sleep there,</b> on the rows of stone. The Gemara asks: <b>But why</b> did the priests sleep on the stones? <b>Let them bring beds</b> into the Chamber of the Hearth. <b>Abaye said:</b> It is <b>not proper conduct to bring beds into the Temple.</b>

### Part 10
The mishna further teaches that with regard to the <b>young men of the priesthood, each</b> of them would sleep with <b>his garment on the ground.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> is it that <b>there,</b> in the earlier mishna, the <i>tanna</i> <b>calls them young</b> [<b><i>rovim</i></b>] priests, whereas <b>here,</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>calls them</b>
