### Part 1
Is the distance <b>from the heavens to the earth further, or</b> is the distance <b>from east to west</b> further? <b>They said to him: From east to west</b> is a greater distance. <b>Know</b> that this is so, <b>as</b> when the <b>sun is in the east, everyone looks at it</b> without hurting their eyes, and when the <b>sun is in the west, everyone looks at it</b> without hurting their eyes. By contrast, when the <b>sun is in</b> the <b>middle of</b> the <b>sky, no one looks at it,</b> as it would hurt their eyes. This shows that the sun’s place in the middle of the sky is not as far from the earth as its remote positions in the extreme east and west.

### Part 2
<b>But the Sages say: This</b> distance <b>and that</b> distance <b>are equal, as it is stated: “For as the heaven is high above the earth,</b> so great is His kindness toward them that fear Him. <b>As far as the east is from the west,</b> so far has He removed our transgressions from us” (Psalms 103:11–12). The verses compare the extent of God’s kindness and His removal of transgressions to vast expanses. <b>And if one of the</b> distances <b>is greater</b> than the other, <b>let</b> the verse <b>write</b> that <b>both of</b> God’s enumerated attributes are <b>like</b> the measure <b>that is greater. But</b> if so, with regard to the <b>sun in</b> the <b>middle of</b> the <b>sky, what is the reason</b> that <b>no one looks at it?</b> It is <b>because it stands exposed and nothing covers it,</b> whereas it is partially screened when it is in the east or the west.

### Part 3
Alexander continued to ask questions of the Elders of the Negev. <b>He said to them:</b> Were the <b>heavens created first or</b> was <b>the earth</b> created first? <b>They said:</b> The <b>heavens were created first, as it is stated: “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth”</b> (Genesis 1:1).

### Part 4
<b>He said to them:</b> Was the <b>light created first, or</b> was the <b>darkness</b> created first? <b>They said to him: This matter has no solution,</b> as the verses do not indicate an answer. The Gemara asks: <b>But let them say to him</b> that the <b>darkness was created first, as it is written: “Now the earth was unformed and void, and darkness</b> was upon the face of the deep” (Genesis 1:2), <b>and</b> only <b>then</b> does it state: <b>“And God said: Let there be light. And there was light”</b> (Genesis 1:3). Why did they not say that the darkness was created first?

### Part 5
The Gemara answers that the Elders <b>maintained:</b> We must not answer this question, <b>lest</b> he <b>come to ask</b> questions about Creation that may not be discussed, i.e., <b>what</b> is <b>above</b> the firmament <b>and what is below</b> the earth, <b>what was before</b> Creation, <b>and what</b> will be <b>after</b> the end of the world (see <i>Ḥagiga</i> 11b).

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> if the Elders were concerned about such proscribed questions, then with regard to the creation of <b>heaven as well, they should not</b> have <b>said</b> anything <b>to him.</b> Why did they answer the question about heaven, but not the one about darkness? The Gemara answers that <b>initially</b> they <b>assumed:</b> It is <b>merely incidental</b> that <b>he is asking</b> about the creation of the universe, and therefore there is no need for caution. But <b>once they saw that he again asked</b> about the same general matter, <b>they maintained: Let us not tell him</b> an answer, <b>lest</b> he <b>come to ask: What</b> is <b>above</b> the firmament and <b>what is below</b> the earth, <b>what was before</b> Creation, <b>and what</b> will be <b>after</b> the end of the world?

### Part 7
Alexander <b>said to</b> the Elders: <b>Who is</b> truly worthy of being <b>called wise? They said to him,</b> citing a tradition (see <i>Avot</i> 2:9): <b>Who is</b> the <b>wise</b> person? <b>The one who sees</b> and anticipates <b>the consequences</b> of his behavior. <b>He said to them: Who is</b> truly worthy of being <b>called mighty? They said to him,</b> again citing a tradition (see <i>Avot</i> 4:1): <b>Who is</b> the <b>mighty</b> person? <b>The one who masters his desire. He said to them: Who is</b> worthy of being <b>called wealthy? They said to him: Who is</b> the <b>wealthy</b> person? <b>The one who is pleased with his</b> own <b>portion</b> (see <i>Avot</i> 4:1).

### Part 8
<b>He said to them: What must a man do and</b> thereby ensure that <b>he will live? They said to him:</b> Such a man <b>must</b> figuratively <b>kill himself,</b> by living moderately. Alexander further inquired: <b>What must a man do and</b> ensure that <b>he will die? They said to him:</b> Such a man <b>must keep himself alive,</b> i.e., lead an extravagant and indulgent life. <b>He said to them: What must a man do and</b> ensure that <b>he will be accepted by people? They said</b> to Alexander: <b>He must hate the king and the authorities</b> and avoid becoming too close to those in power. Alexander rejected their answer and <b>said to them: My</b> advice for gaining people’s favor <b>is better than yours.</b> One who wants to be accepted <b>must love the king and the authorities, but he must</b> use his connections to <b>perform beneficial</b> acts <b>for people.</b>

### Part 9
<b>He said to them:</b> Is it <b>better</b> for a person <b>to live at sea, or</b> is it <b>better to live on dry land? They said to him:</b> It is <b>better to live on dry land, as all seafarers, their minds are</b> constantly <b>unsettled until they reach the dry land.</b>

### Part 10
<b>He said to them: Who among you is wiser</b> than the others? <b>They said to him: We are all equal</b> in wisdom, <b>as every matter that you say to us, we solve for you unanimously. He said to them: What is</b> the substance of <b>this</b> stance, by which <b>you,</b> the Jewish people, <b>oppose me?</b> Since you are my subjects, and my people constitute the majority, you should concede that our lifestyle is superior. <b>They said to him:</b> Your dominance is inconsequential, as sometimes even <b>the Satan is victorious,</b> by convincing people to act in a manner that is clearly incorrect.

### Part 11
<b>He said to them: Consequently,</b> due to your insolence, <b>I am executing you by the edict of kings. They said to him:</b> Certainly, the <b>authority is in the hand of the king</b> to execute as you wish; <b>but falsehood is unbecoming for the king,</b> and you have pledged not to harm us. <b>Immediately,</b> Alexander <b>dressed them in garments of purple and placed golden chains [<i>menaykha</i>] upon their necks.</b>

### Part 12
When Alexander was preparing to part from the Elders of the Negev, <b>he said to them: I want to go to</b> wage war against <b>the country of Africa [<i>Afriki</i>];</b> what do you recommend? <b>They said to him: You will be unable to go</b> there, <b>as the Mountains of Darkness block</b> the passes. <b>He said to them:</b> It is <b>not possible for me not to go;</b> and it is <b>due</b> to <b>this</b> reason that <b>I ask you</b> to advise me. <b>Rather</b> than refraining from my campaign, <b>what</b> might <b>I do</b> to cross the Mountains of Darkness?

### Part 13
<b>They said to him: Bring Libyan donkeys that walk</b> even <b>in the darkness [<i>behavra</i>],</b> and these animals will guide you through those passes. <b>And bring coils of rope, and tie</b> one end of rope <b>on this</b> near <b>side</b> of the mountains, as you are about to enter there, <b>so that when you come</b> to return <b>by</b> the same path, <b>you may take hold of</b> the ropes left from your initial march, <b>and,</b> following them, <b>you will come back to your place.</b>

### Part 14
Alexander <b>did this and went</b> on his campaign. <b>He came to a certain town whose entire</b> population was <b>women,</b> and <b>he wanted to wage battle against them.</b> The women <b>said to him:</b> It is not in your interest to fight us. <b>If you kill us,</b> people <b>will say:</b> Alexander <b>kills women;</b> and <b>if we kill you,</b> people <b>will say:</b> Alexander is the <b>king whom women killed</b> in battle. Instead of fighting them, Alexander <b>said to them: Bring me bread. They brought him bread of gold, upon a table of gold.</b>
