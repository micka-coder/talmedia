<b>and</b> the growers <b>rub them with a rope</b> made <b>of palm</b> fronds, <b>to which the seeds adhere, and they plant</b> the tree in a spot <b>where the sea emits</b> deposits of <b>sediment [<i>sirton</i>].</b> A tree planted in this manner <b>produces</b> wood that is suitable for <b>a beam,</b> but it <b>does not produce fruit. And</b> as the tree does not divert its resources to yielding fruit, its wood is so robust and heavy that with regard to <b>three of its branches, a bridge cannot support them.</b>

### Part 2
§ The mishna teaches: The priest <b>assembled the large arrangement</b> on the eastern side of the altar, and its opening was on the eastern side of the altar. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that an opening was formed in the arrangement? This matter is subject to a dispute between <b>Rav Huna and Rav Ḥisda: One said</b> that the opening was formed <b>so that the wind would blow into it</b> and fan the flames of the arrangement. <b>And one said</b> that it was formed <b>so that</b> the priests <b>would</b> be able to <b>light from there the kindling</b> that was placed between the logs.

### Part 3
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the mishna: <b>There was space between the logs, as</b> the priests <b>would ignite the kindling from there.</b> Evidently, the kindling was not ignited from the opening. The Gemara explains: The Sage who maintains that the kindling was lit from the opening in the east of the arrangement could <b>say to you</b> that in addition to lighting kindling from the opening, the priests would <b>fashion many spaces</b> within the arrangement, through which they would ignite kindling in order to increase the fire.

### Part 5
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> 3:1 Four lotteries were conducted in the Temple each day in order to determine which priests would perform which of the Temple rites. After describing the first of the lotteries, for removal of the ashes, the <i>tanna</i> describes the second lottery. <b>The</b> priest <b>appointed</b> to oversee the lotteries <b>said to</b> the priests: <b>Come and participate in the lottery</b> to determine <b>who is the</b> priest <b>who</b> will <b>slaughter</b> the daily offering; <b>and who</b> is the priest <b>who</b> will <b>sprinkle</b> its blood; and <b>who</b> will <b>remove the ashes from the inner,</b> golden <b>altar;</b> and <b>who</b> will <b>remove the ashes from the Candelabrum;</b> and <b>who</b> will <b>take</b> the <b>limbs</b> of the daily offering <b>up to the ramp</b> to be burned afterward.

### Part 6
The limbs of the daily offering taken up to the ramp were divided among the priests in the following manner: One priest took <b>the head and the right</b> hind <b>leg</b> up to the altar; <b>and</b> a second took <b>the two forelegs;</b> a third <b>the haunch,</b> including the lower spine and the tail, <b>and the left</b> hind <b>leg;</b> a fourth <b>the breast and the cud,</b> i.e., the neck and appended internal organs, including the windpipe, liver, and heart; <b>and</b> a fifth <b>the two flanks;</b> a sixth <b>the innards; and</b> a seventh <b>the fine flour</b> from the accompanying meal offering; <b>and</b> an eighth <b>the griddle-cake</b> offering; <b>and</b> a ninth <b>the wine</b> for the libation.

### Part 7
They <b>conducted the lottery</b> to determine the thirteen tasks, i.e., slaughtering, carrying the nine items or pairs of items, sprinkling the blood, removing the ashes from the inner altar, and removing the ashes from the Candelabrum. <b>And whoever won</b> that lottery <b>won</b> the right to perform the slaughter, and the twelve priests standing to his right won the other privileges.

### Part 8
MISHNA 3:2 The appointed one <b>said to</b> the priests: <b>Go out and observe if</b> it is day and <b>the time for slaughter</b> has <b>arrived. If</b> the time has <b>arrived, the observer says: There is light. Matya ben Shmuel says</b> that the appointed priest phrased his question differently, saying: <b>Is the entire eastern sky illuminated as far as Hebron? And</b> the observer <b>says: Yes.</b>

### Part 9
MISHNA 3:3 The appointed priest <b>said to</b> the priests: <b>Go out and bring</b> me <b>a lamb from the Chamber of the Lambs,</b> where lambs that had been examined and found to be unblemished were kept. <b>And the Chamber of the Lambs is located in the northwestern corner</b> of the building of the Chamber of the Hearth. <b>There were four chambers there,</b> in that building: <b>One</b> was <b>the Chamber of the Lambs; and one</b> was <b>the Chamber of the Seals,</b> located in the northeastern corner, where the priest stored receipts given to those seeking to purchase animal offerings; <b>and one</b> was <b>the Chamber of the Hearth,</b> where there was a fire burning to warm the priests; <b>and</b> the last <b>one</b> was <b>the chamber in which</b> the priests <b>prepared the shewbread.</b>

### Part 10
MISHNA 3:4 The priests <b>entered the Chamber of the Vessels,</b> where the service vessels required for the daily Temple service were stored. They <b>took out from there ninety-three silver vessels and gold vessels. They</b> then <b>gave</b> the lamb selected for <b>the daily offering</b> water <b>to drink in a cup</b>
