<b>and</b> the growers <b>rub them with a rope</b> made <b>of palm</b> fronds, <b>to which the seeds adhere, and they plant</b> the tree in a spot <b>where the sea emits</b> deposits of <b>sediment [<i>sirton</i>].</b> A tree planted in this manner <b>produces</b> wood that is suitable for <b>a beam,</b> but it <b>does not produce fruit. And</b> as the tree does not divert its resources to yielding fruit, its wood is so robust and heavy that with regard to <b>three of its branches, a bridge cannot support them.</b>

### Part 2
§ The mishna teaches: The priest <b>assembled the large arrangement</b> on the eastern side of the altar, and its opening was on the eastern side of the altar. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that an opening was formed in the arrangement? This matter is subject to a dispute between <b>Rav Huna and Rav Ḥisda: One said</b> that the opening was formed <b>so that the wind would blow into it</b> and fan the flames of the arrangement. <b>And one said</b> that it was formed <b>so that</b> the priests <b>would</b> be able to <b>light from there the kindling</b> that was placed between the logs.

### Part 3
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the mishna: <b>There was space between the logs, as</b> the priests <b>would ignite the kindling from there.</b> Evidently, the kindling was not ignited from the opening. The Gemara explains: The Sage who maintains that the kindling was lit from the opening in the east of the arrangement could <b>say to you</b> that in addition to lighting kindling from the opening, the priests would <b>fashion many spaces</b> within the arrangement, through which they would ignite kindling in order to increase the fire.
