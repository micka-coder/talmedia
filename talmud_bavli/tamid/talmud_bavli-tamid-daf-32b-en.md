### Part 1
Alexander <b>said to</b> the women: <b>Do people eat bread of gold? They said to him: But if</b> all <b>you wanted</b> was actual <b>bread, didn’t you have bread to eat in your</b> own <b>place?</b> It was not for bread <b>that you took</b> up a campaign and toiled <b>and came here.</b> You must have come to increase your wealth. <b>When</b> Alexander <b>left and came</b> back to his land, he <b>wrote upon the gate of the town: I, Alexander of Macedon, was a fool until I came to the country of Africa of women, and I learned sense from women.</b>

### Part 2
§ With regard to Alexander, the Gemara relates: <b>When he took</b> himself <b>and went</b> on his way, <b>he sat at a certain spring</b> and was <b>eating bread. He had salted fish [<i>guldenei</i>] in his hands,</b> and <b>while he cleansed them</b> of their excessive salt, a particularly pleasant <b>fragrance fell upon them.</b> Alexander <b>said</b> to himself: I may <b>conclude from</b> this event that <b>this spring comes from</b> the <b>Garden of Eden.</b>

### Part 3
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say: He took from those waters</b> and <b>washed his face.</b> And <b>there are</b> those <b>who say: He ascended</b> along the length of <b>the entire</b> spring <b>until he reached the entrance of the Garden of Eden. He raised</b> a loud <b>voice,</b> calling out: <b>Open the gate for me!</b> The sentry of the Garden of Eden <b>said to him: “This is the gate of the Lord;</b> the righteous shall enter into it” (Psalms 118:20). Since you are not righteous, you may not enter. <b>He said to them: I too</b> am worthy, as <b>I am a king; I am very important.</b> If I will not be admitted, at least <b>give me something</b> from inside. <b>They gave him one eyeball. He brought it</b> and <b>he weighed all the gold and silver that he had against</b> the eyeball, and yet the riches <b>did not balance</b> against the eyeball’s greater weight.

### Part 4
<b>He said to the Sages: What is this?</b> Why does this eyeball outweigh everything? <b>They said: It is the eyeball</b> of a mortal person <b>of flesh and blood, which is not satisfied</b> ever. <b>He said to them: From where</b> do you know <b>that this is</b> the reason for the unbalanced scale? The Sages answered him: <b>Take a small amount of dirt and cover</b> the eye. He did so, and it was <b>immediately balanced</b> by its proper counterweight. The eye is never satisfied while it can see, <b>as it is written: “The netherworld and destruction are never satiated;</b> so the eyes of man are never satiated” (Proverbs 27:20).

### Part 5
The Gemara cites a statement related to its earlier account of Alexander’s journey. <b>The school of Eliyahu taught: Gehenna is above the heavens, and some say</b> that it is <b>beyond the Mountains of Darkness.</b>

### Part 6
The chapter, as well as the talmudic portion of the tractate, concludes with words of praise for those who study Torah. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya taught:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who occupies</b> himself <b>with Torah at night, the Divine Presence is across from him, as it is stated: “Arise, cry out in the night, at the beginning of the watches; pour out your heart like water before the face of the Lord,</b> lift up your hands toward Him” (Lamentations 2:19). <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya said: Torah scholars increase peace in the world, as it is stated: “And all your children [<i>banayikh</i>] shall be taught of the Lord, and great shall be the peace of your children”</b> (Isaiah 54:13). This can be read as <i>bonayikh</i>, your builders, i.e., scholars build and increase peace for the entire world.
