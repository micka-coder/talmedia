### Part 1
<b>Here,</b> where the <i>baraita</i> teaches that if one is unsure about the burglar’s intentions it is prohibited for him to kill him, it is referring to <b>a father</b> who comes <b>to</b> rob his <b>son.</b> A father has great compassion for his son, and therefore it may be presumed that he will not kill his son if he resists. Accordingly, the son is prohibited from killing his father unless he knows for certain that his father has the intention of killing him. <b>There,</b> where the <i>baraita</i> teaches that if one is unsure about the burglar’s intentions it is permitted for him to kill him, it is referring to <b>a son</b> who comes <b>to</b> rob his <b>father.</b> Since a son has less compassion for his father, it may be presumed that he would be ready to kill his father if he resists. Therefore, the father is permitted to kill his son unless he knows for certain that his son would never kill him.

### Part 2
<b>Rav says:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who breaks into my</b> house, <b>I would kill</b> him, as I would presume that he is ready to kill me, <b>except for Rav Ḥanina bar Sheila,</b> whom I would not kill. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that Rav excludes Rabbi Ḥanina bar Sheila? <b>If we say</b> that Rav trusts him <b>because he is a righteous person,</b> this is difficult, <b>as</b> the case is one where <b>he broke into</b> his <b>house,</b> which indicates that he is not a righteous person. <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>because</b> he would say: <b>I am certain that he would have mercy upon me</b> just <b>like a father</b> would have mercy <b>on a son.</b>

### Part 3
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: “If the sun is risen upon him, <b>there shall be blood shed on his account”</b> (Exodus 22:2), <b>both during the week and on Shabbat.</b> “If a burglar is found breaking <b>in…there shall not be blood shed on his account”</b> (Exodus 22:1), <b>both during the week and on Shabbat.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara clarifies this <i>baraita</i>: <b>Granted</b> that with regard to <b>“there shall not be blood shed on his account,”</b> it <b>was necessary</b> to say that this applies <b>both during the week and on Shabbat,</b> as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that this is <b>just as it is</b> in the case of <b>those who are executed by the court, who are not executed on Shabbat.</b> Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us that</b> the burglar <b>may be slain</b> in self-defense even on Shabbat. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>“there shall be blood shed on his account,”</b> the statement that this applies <b>both during the week and on Shabbat</b> is puzzling. <b>Now,</b> if <b>on a weekday he may not be slain, is it necessary</b> to say that he may not be slain <b>on Shabbat?</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rav Sheshet says:</b> This ruling <b>is necessary only</b> to teach that if a building collapsed on the burglar on Shabbat, one is obligated <b>to clear the pile</b> of stones from <b>on top of him</b> and perform any action necessary to rescue him, even if it involves the desecration of Shabbat; one does not say that while he is not permitted to actively kill him, he is also not obligated to save him.

### Part 6
§ Concerning the verse that states: “If a burglar is found breaking in, and is smitten and dies, there shall not be blood shed on his account” (Exodus 22:1), <b>the Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And is smitten,” by any person</b> who strikes him; <b>“and dies,” by any</b> means of <b>death by which you can put him to death.</b> The Gemara clarifies this <i>baraita</i>: <b>Granted,</b> with regard to the words <b>“and is smitten,”</b> it <b>was necessary</b> to say that he may be struck <b>by any person,</b> as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that it is only <b>the owner of the house whom</b> the burglar <b>is certain</b> will resist him, because there is a presumption <b>that a person does not restrain himself</b> when faced <b>with</b> losing <b>his money,</b> and therefore it is only the homeowner’s life that is in danger from the burglar. <b>But</b> as for <b>another person,</b> the burglar is <b>not</b> sure that he will try to stop him, and therefore that other person may not kill him, since the burglar did not come with the intention of killing him.

### Part 7
Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us that</b> this burglar <b>is</b> considered <b>a pursuer, and</b> he is subject to the same <i>halakha</i> as anyone who pursues another in order to kill him, namely, that anyone may kill the pursuer in order to rescue the one being pursued. Therefore, <b>even another person</b> is permitted to kill the burglar in order to save the homeowner. <b>But</b> that which the <i>baraita</i> teaches, that the words <b>“and dies”</b> teach that he may be slain <b>by any</b> means of <b>death by which you can put him to death, why do I</b> need this?

### Part 8
The Gemara clarifies the difficulty: This can be <b>derived from</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing <b>a murderer, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse with regard to a murderer states: <b>“He that smote him shall be put to death, for he is a murderer”</b> (Numbers 35:21). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the murderer is put to death <b>with the</b> mode of <b>execution stated concerning him,</b> namely, killing by decapitation. <b>From where</b> do I derive <b>that if you cannot put him to death with the</b> mode of <b>execution written concerning him,</b> e.g., if he is escaping, <b>that you can put him to death with any</b> mode of <b>execution with which you can put him to death? The verse states:</b> “He that smote him <b>shall be put to death [<i>mot yumat</i>],”</b> the doubled verb teaching that he is put to death <b>in any case,</b> by any mode of execution. Why not derive the <i>halakha</i> of a burglar from the <i>halakha</i> of a murderer?

### Part 9
The Gemara rejects this reasoning: <b>There it is different, as the verse</b> explicitly <b>states: “<i>Mot yumat</i>,”</b> which serves to include all modes of execution.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>learn from it</b> a principle that can be applied to all people who may be put to death? The Gemara rejects this reasoning: This case does not serve as a source for a principle, <b>because</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a murderer and</b> of <b>a blood redeemer,</b> i.e., a relative of one who was killed who is allowed to kill his relative’s killer (see <i>Makkot</i> 11b), <b>are two verses that come as one, and two verses that come as one do not teach</b> a principle. In other words, if a <i>halakha</i> is stated with regard to two specific cases in the Torah, the <i>halakha</i> is understood to apply only to those cases. Had the <i>halakha</i> applied to all other relevant cases as well, it would not have been necessary for the Torah to teach it twice. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> had to teach us that this <i>halakha</i> also applies to a burglar who breaks into a person’s house.

### Part 11
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: From the words: “If a burglar is found <b>breaking in”</b> (Exodus 22:1), <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies to a burglar who came <b>breaking in</b> through a wall. But <b>from where</b> do I derive that the same <i>halakha</i> applies if he was found on <b>his roof,</b> in <b>his yard, or</b> in <b>the enclosed area</b> behind <b>his</b> house? Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “If <b>a burglar is found,”</b> which teaches that the <i>halakha</i> applies <b>in any case. If</b> that is <b>so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Breaking in”? Because</b> the Torah speaks of a common case, and <b>most thieves are found breaking in.</b>

### Part 12
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: From the words: “If a burglar is found <b>breaking in,” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies to a burglar who came <b>breaking in</b> through a wall. But <b>from where</b> do I derive that the same <i>halakha</i> applies if he was found on <b>his roof,</b> in <b>his yard, or</b> in <b>the enclosed area</b> behind <b>his</b> house? Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “If <b>a burglar is found,”</b> which teaches that the <i>halakha</i> applies <b>in any case. If</b> that is <b>so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Breaking in”?</b> This teaches that <b>his breaking in is his forewarning.</b> If a burglar is found breaking into a house, the owner need not formally forewarn him before killing him. If he is found elsewhere, such a forewarning is necessary.

### Part 13
§ <b>Rav Huna says:</b> If <b>a minor was pursuing</b> another person in order to kill him, the pursued party <b>may be saved with</b> the pursuer’s <b>life.</b> That is to say, one is permitted to save the pursued party by killing the minor who is pursuing him, and one does not say that since the minor lacks halakhic competence, he is not subject to punishment. The Gemara explains: Rav Huna <b>maintains</b> that <b>a pursuer,</b> in general, <b>does not require forewarning,</b> and <b>there is no difference</b> with regard to this matter <b>between an adult and a minor.</b> The essence of the matter is rescuing the pursued party from death, and therefore the pursuer’s liability to receive the death penalty is irrelevant.

### Part 14
<b>Rav Ḥisda raised an objection to Rav Huna</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If a woman was giving birth and her life was being endangered by the fetus, the life of the fetus may be sacrificed in order to save the mother. But once <b>his head has emerged</b> during the birthing process, <b>he may not be harmed</b> in order to save the mother, <b>because</b> one <b>life may not be pushed aside to</b> save another <b>life.</b> If one is permitted to save the pursued party by killing the minor who is pursuing him, <b>why</b> is this so? The fetus <b>is a pursuer</b> who is endangering his mother’s life. The Gemara answers: This is not difficult, as <b>it is different there,</b> with regard to the woman giving birth, <b>since she is being pursued by Heaven.</b> Since the fetus is not acting of his own volition and endangering his mother of his own will, his life may not be taken in order to save his mother.

### Part 15
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that a <i>baraita</i> <b>supports</b> the ruling of Rav Huna, who said that a pursuer does not require a forewarning: If <b>a pursuer was pursuing another</b> person <b>in order to kill him,</b> a third party <b>says to</b> the pursuer: <b>See that he</b> whom you are pursuing to kill <b>is a Jew, and</b> a loyal <b>member of the covenant, and the Torah stated: “Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed”</b> (Genesis 9:6). <b>The Torah stated: Save the blood of this</b> person who is being pursued <b>with the blood of that</b> person who is pursuing him. The fact that there is no indication here that the pursuer must say that he heard the forewarning suggests that forewarning is not required, as stated by Rav Huna.

### Part 16
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: Perhaps <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> was taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says: A <i>ḥaver</i>,</b> who is thoroughly knowledgeable in <i>halakha</i>, <b>does not need</b> to be issued <b>a forewarning</b> by witnesses in order to become liable to be punished, <b>because forewarning is given only to distinguish between unintentional</b> sin <b>and intentional</b> sin, and a <i>ḥaver</i> is certainly aware of the <i>halakha</i>. The same may be said about a pursuer: Since his malice is clear, he does not require a forewarning; his sin is obviously intentional. Those who disagree with Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, and say that even a <i>ḥaver</i> needs to be issued a forewarning would say that a pursuer must be forewarned as well.

### Part 17
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof that a pursuer must be forewarned, and therefore one may not save a pursued party by killing a minor who is pursuing him, from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>a pursuer was pursuing another</b> person <b>in order to kill him,</b> and a third party <b>said to him: See that he</b> whom you are pursuing to kill <b>is a Jew, and</b> a loyal <b>member of the covenant, and the Torah stated: “Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed”</b> (Genesis 9:6), in this case, <b>if</b> the pursuer <b>said: I know this to be so,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from being killed, but if he said: <b>I am doing it on this condition,</b> i.e., knowing that I am liable to be killed for this, he is <b>liable</b> to be slain. This indicates that even a pursuer must be issued a forewarning.

### Part 18
The Gemara rejects this proof: This forewarning is <b>not necessary</b> except in a case <b>where</b> the pursuer and the person issuing the warning <b>are standing on two</b> opposite <b>sides of a river,</b> so <b>that</b> the latter <b>cannot save</b> the party being pursued by killing the pursuer. <b>What is there</b> for him to do? Unable to save the pursued party, <b>he wants</b> at least <b>to bring</b> the pursuer <b>to court,</b> so that he will be convicted and have the death penalty administered to him. But in order to administer punishment, <b>the court requires</b> that the offender receive proper <b>forewarning.</b> It is for this reason that the <i>baraita</i> speaks of forewarning, but a pursuer may be killed by a bystander even without having been forewarned.

### Part 19
<b>If you wish, say</b> instead that <b>Rav Huna</b> could have <b>said to you: I stated</b> my opinion that it is permitted to kill a minor pursuer <b>in accordance with the <i>tanna</i></b> who spoke of the issue <b>of</b> a burglar who <b>breaks into</b> a house. <b>As</b> this <i>tanna</i> <b>says</b> that <b>his breaking in is his forewarning,</b> that is, a burglar who breaks into a house needs no further forewarning. Here, too, anyone who is pursuing another in order to kill him does not require forewarning since his pursuit is his forewarning.
