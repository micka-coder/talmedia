### Part 1
<b>as,</b> even today, <b>nothing except wine brings wailing</b> and trouble <b>upon a person;</b> most sins are caused by drunkenness. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The Tree of Knowledge <b>was</b> the <b>wheat</b> plant. This is proven by the fact <b>that,</b> even today, <b>an infant does not know how to call out</b> to his <b>father or mother until he tastes the taste of grain,</b> and for this reason wheat is called “the Tree of Knowledge.” <b>Rabbi Neḥemya says:</b> The Tree of Knowledge <b>was a fig</b> tree, <b>because</b> it was <b>with the matter with which they sinned</b> that <b>they were rehabilitated, as it is stated: “And they sewed together fig leaves,</b> and made for themselves loincloths” (Genesis 3:7).

### Part 2
§ The Gemara continues its discussion of wine. Referring to the verse that states: <b>“The words of King Lemuel, the burden with which his mother corrected him”</b> (Proverbs 31:1), <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai:</b> This <b>teaches that</b> when Solomon’s <b>mother</b> Bathsheba saw Solomon engaged in excessive drinking, she <b>bound him to a pillar</b> to have him flogged. <b>And she said to him: “What, my son? And what, son of my womb? And what, son of my vows?”</b> (Proverbs 31:2). She meant: <b>“What, my son?” Everyone knows that your father,</b> David, <b>was a God-fearing</b> man, and <b>now,</b> when they see you sin, <b>they will</b> all <b>say</b> that <b>his mother caused him</b> to drink, i.e., that you engage in these behaviors because you are my son.

### Part 3
<b>“And what, son of my womb?”</b> That is to say: With regard to <b>all of the women of your father’s house, once they conceive they no longer see the face of the king, but I pushed</b> myself in <b>and entered</b> the king’s chamber while I was pregnant, <b>so that I might have a son who is strong and fair-skinned.</b> There are times during a woman’s pregnancy when intercourse is beneficial for the development of the fetus. Bathsheba was telling Solomon: I did my utmost to ensure that you have extra strength and beauty, and now you use that strength and appeal to pursue drink.

### Part 4
<b>“And what, son of my vows?”</b> That is to say: With regard to <b>all of</b> the <b>women of your father’s house, they would take vows</b> while they were pregnant, saying: <b>Let me have a son who is fit to be king. But I,</b> by contrast, <b>took a vow and said: Let me have a son who is diligent and filled with</b> knowledge of <b>the Torah and fit for prophecy.</b>

### Part 5
It is further stated there: <b>“It is not for kings, O Lemoel, it is not for kings to drink wine;</b> nor for princes to say: Where is strong drink?” (Proverbs 31:4). The Gemara provides an explanation of the meaning of each part of this verse. <b>“It is not for kings”:</b> Bathsheba <b>said to</b> her son Solomon: <b>What have you to do with kings who drink wine and become intoxicated and say: Why [<i>lamma</i>] do we need God [<i>El</i>]?</b> The Gemara continues to explain the verse. <b>“Nor for princes [<i>rozenim</i>] to say: Where is strong drink?”</b> This means that <b>one</b> like Solomon, <b>to whom all the secrets [<i>razei</i>] of the world are revealed, should he drink wine and become intoxicated?</b> Alternatively, <b>there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that this part of the verse should be understood as follows: <b>One</b> like Solomon, <b>to whom all the princes of the world rise early</b> to come <b>to his door, should he drink wine and become intoxicated?</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: From where</b> can it be learned <b>that Solomon repented and admitted to his mother</b> that she was justified in her rebukes? <b>As it is written: “For I am more foolish than a man, and have not the understanding of a man”</b> (Proverbs 30:2). This should be understood as follows: <b>“For I am more foolish than a man [<i>ish</i>]”;</b> that is, I am more foolish than Noah, who sinned with wine and is called “a man,” <b>as it is written: “And Noah began to be a farmer [<i>ish ha’adama</i></b>]” (Genesis 9:20). <b>“And have not the understanding of a man [<i>adam</i>]”; this</b> is a reference to <b>Adam the first</b> man, who also sinned with wine, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir, who says that the Tree of Knowledge was a grapevine.

### Part 7
§ The mishna teaches that if the son <b>ate</b> and drank the requisite amounts of meat and wine <b>with a group</b> assembled for the performance <b>of a mitzva,</b> he does not become liable as a stubborn and rebellious son. <b>Rabbi Abbahu says: He is not liable unless he eats with a group that is entirely</b> made up of <b>idlers.</b> This seems to indicate that if he eats and drinks in the company of decent people, even if he consumes the required amounts that would otherwise make him liable, he does not become a stubborn and rebellious son.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: If the son <b>ate</b> and drank the requisite amounts of meat and wine <b>with a group</b> assembled for the performance <b>of a mitzva he does not become</b> liable as <b>a stubborn and rebellious son?</b> A precise reading of the mishna indicates that <b>the reason</b> that he does not become liable is that he ate and drank with a group assembled for the performance <b>of a mitzva. But</b> if they were <b>not</b> assembled for the performance of <b>a mitzva</b> he would be liable <b>even if</b> the group <b>is not entirely</b> made up of <b>idlers.</b> The Gemara answers: There is no contradiction between the mishna and the statement of Rabbi Abbahu. In fact, the son is liable only if he eats with a group of whom all are idlers. And the mishna <b>teaches us this: That even if</b> the group <b>is entirely</b> composed of <b>idlers, since they are occupied with a mitzva,</b> there is <b>no</b> concern that he <b>will be drawn</b> to sin.

### Part 9
The mishna teaches that if the son <b>ate</b> and drank the requisite amounts of meat and wine <b>at</b> a meal celebrating <b>the intercalation of the month</b> he does not become liable as a stubborn and rebellious son. The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that meat and wine are brought up</b> to the upper chamber where the month is intercalated? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>They ascend</b> to intercalate the month <b>only with</b> a meal consisting of <b>bread</b> made of <b>grain and legumes?</b> The Gemara answers: The mishna <b>teaches us this: Even though they</b> ordinarily <b>ascend to</b> the upper chamber <b>only with bread and legumes, and he brought up meat and wine and ate</b> them, <b>since they are occupied with a mitzva,</b> there is <b>no</b> concern that he <b>will be drawn</b> to sin.

### Part 10
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>No fewer than ten men ascend</b> to the upper chamber <b>for the intercalation of the month; and they ascend</b> to intercalate the month <b>only with bread</b> made of <b>grain and legumes; and they ascend only on the night of</b> the month’s <b>intercalation; and they ascend not by day, but only at night.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: <b>They ascend not at night, but only by day?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>As Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said to his sons:</b> When you come to intercalate the month, <b>ascend early and leave early so that people should hear your</b> comings and goings, and thereby know that you have been addressing this matter. The proper time for this is at daybreak, between night and day.

### Part 11
§ The mishna teaches that if he <b>ate second tithe in Jerusalem</b> he is not liable as a stubborn and rebellious son. The Gemara explains: <b>Since he eats</b> the second tithe <b>in the normal way,</b> i.e., as he is commanded, in Jerusalem, <b>he will not be drawn</b> to sin.

### Part 12
The mishna teaches that if he <b>ate</b> the meat of unslaughtered <b>animal carcasses or <i>tereifot</i></b> or <b>repugnant creatures or creeping animals,</b> he is not liable as a stubborn and rebellious son. <b>Rava says:</b> If the boy <b>ate the meat of fowl,</b> even if he ate the required amount, <b>he does not become a stubborn and rebellious son.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that if the boy <b>ate</b> the meat of unslaughtered <b>animal carcasses or <i>tereifot</i></b> or <b>repugnant creatures or creeping animals, he does not become a stubborn and rebellious son?</b> A precise reading of the mishna indicates that it is only if he ate the meat of such animals that he is not liable; <b>but</b> if he ate the meat of <b>kosher</b> animals, which includes the meat of fowl, <b>he would become a stubborn and rebellious son,</b> counter to the ruling of Rava. The Gemara resolves this difficulty: <b>When we learned</b> this in <b>the mishna as well,</b> it was in reference <b>to completing</b> the measure of meat. Rava was speaking of the primary consumption of meat.

### Part 14
The mishna teaches that if <b>he ate an item that</b> involves performing <b>a mitzva or an item</b> that involves committing <b>a transgression,</b> he does not become a stubborn and rebellious son. The Gemara explains: This ruling concerning <b>an item</b> that involves performing <b>a mitzva</b> includes mitzvot by rabbinic law, such as <b>comforting mourners.</b> And the ruling concerning <b>an item</b> that involves committing <b>a transgression</b> includes transgressing prohibitions by rabbinic law, such as eating on a <b>communal fast.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>And what</b> is <b>the reason</b> that eating an item involving a mitzva or a transgression does not render him a stubborn and rebellious son? The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states:</b> “This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious; <b>he will not obey our voices”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:20), which indicates that the <i>halakha</i> applies to a boy who does not obey <b>“our voices,”</b> i.e., the voice of his parents, <b>but not</b> to one who also does not obey <b>the voice of God.</b>

### Part 16
The mishna teaches that if the rebellious boy <b>ate any</b> other <b>food but did not eat meat,</b> or if <b>he drank any beverage but did not drink wine,</b> he is not liable as a stubborn and rebellious son. The Gemara clarifies. That which the mishna teaches: The statement: If <b>he ate any</b> other <b>food but did not eat meat, comes to include</b> pressed <b>figs from</b> the town of <b>Ke’ila,</b> the eating of which is as satisfying as eating meat, but for which one is not liable. And that which the mishna teaches: The statement: If <b>he drank any beverage but did not drink wine, comes to include honey and milk,</b> which, though they can have a slightly intoxicating effect, do not render him liable as a stubborn and rebellious son.

### Part 17
From where is it learned that honey and milk are intoxicating? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a priest <b>ate</b> pressed <b>figs from Ke’ila, or drank honey or milk,</b> thereby becoming intoxicated, <b>and he</b> then <b>entered the Temple</b> to perform the Temple service,
