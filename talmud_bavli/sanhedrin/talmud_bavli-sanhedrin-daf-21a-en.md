### Part 1
“And they made Solomon, son of David, king the second time, <b>and anointed him unto the Lord to be leader, and Tzadok</b> to be priest” (I Chronicles 29:22). This verse <b>compares a leader,</b> referring to King Solomon, <b>to Tzadok,</b> the High Priest: <b>Just as</b> for <b>Tzadok, half</b> of the shewbread given to the priests is <b>for him,</b> the High Priest, <b>and half</b> is <b>for</b> all <b>his brothers,</b> the other priests, <b>so too</b> for <b>the leader, half</b> is <b>for him and half</b> is <b>for his brothers,</b> the rest of the army.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>Tzadok himself, from where do we</b> derive that the High Priest takes half? The Gemara responds: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The Torah states with regard to the apportionment of the shewbread: <b>“And it shall be for Aaron and his sons,</b> and they shall eat it in a holy place” (Leviticus 24:9), from which it is inferred: <b>Half for Aaron and half for his sons.</b>

### Part 3
mishna The king <b>“shall not add many wives for himself”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:17), <b>but</b> only <b>eighteen. Rabbi Yehuda says: He</b> may <b>add many</b> wives <b>for himself, provided that they are not</b> like those who <b>turn his heart</b> away from reverence for God. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Even</b> if he wants to marry only <b>one</b> wife, if <b>she turns his heart away, he should not marry her. If so, why is it stated: “He shall not add many wives for himself”?</b> This teaches <b>that even</b> if his wives are <b>like Abigail,</b> who was righteous and prevented David from sin (see I Samuel, chapter 25), it is prohibited for him to have many wives.

### Part 4
gemara The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that Rabbi Yehuda interprets the rationale</b> behind the mitzva <b>in the verse</b> and draws halakhic conclusions based on that interpretation, <b>and Rabbi Shimon does not interpret the rationale in the verse? But didn’t we hear them</b> hold the <b>opposite</b> opinions with regard to interpreting the rationale behind a mitzva in a verse?

### Part 5
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 10:3): In the case of <b>a widow, whether she is poor or whether she is wealthy, one may not take collateral from her</b> for a loan, <b>as it is stated: “You may not take the garment of a widow for a pledge”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:17); this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> In the case of <b>a wealthy</b> widow, one may <b>take collateral from her.</b> But in the case of <b>a poor</b> widow, <b>one may not take collateral from her,</b> because <b>you</b> are <b>obligated to return</b> it <b>to her, and you</b> will <b>give her a bad name among her neighbors.</b>

### Part 6
<b>And we say</b> about this dispute: <b>What is</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>saying? This</b> is what <b>he is saying: Because you take collateral from her, you are required to return</b> it <b>to her,</b> as the verse states: “And if he is a poor person, you shall not sleep with his pledge; you shall restore the pledge to him when the sun goes down” (Deuteronomy 24:12–13), <b>and you</b> thereby <b>give her a bad name among her neighbors,</b> who will suspect licentious behavior when they see a man come to her house every morning and evening. <b>Evidently,</b> according to this dispute <b>Rabbi Yehuda does not interpret the rationale in the verse and Rabbi Shimon</b> does <b>interpret the rationale in the verse.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara explains: <b>Generally, Rabbi Yehuda does not interpret the rationale in the verse, but it is different here, as</b> the verse itself <b>explains the rationale in the verse: What is the reason</b> that <b>“he shall not add many wives for himself”?</b> He should not add many wives <b>because of</b> what is articulated in the continuation of the verse: <b>“His heart should not turn.”</b>

### Part 8
<b>And Rabbi Shimon</b> could have <b>said to you: Since generally we interpret the rationale in the verse,</b> then <b>if</b> it is <b>so</b> that the prohibition against marrying many wives applies only to wives that are likely to lead his heart astray, <b>the verse should write</b> only: <b>“He shall not add many wives for himself” and</b> then <b>be silent.</b> In that case, <b>I would say,</b> on my own, <b>what is the reason</b> that <b>he shall not add many</b> wives? It is <b>so that</b> his heart <b>should not turn away.</b> Accordingly, <b>why do I</b> need the additional phrase “his heart <b>should not turn away”?</b> It serves to teach another <i>halakha</i>, that <b>even</b> if he wants to marry only <b>one</b> wife, if <b>she turns his heart away, he should not marry her. But</b> then <b>how do I realize</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“He shall not add many</b> wives for himself”? It means <b>that</b> he should not have many wives <b>even</b> if they are <b>like Abigail.</b>

### Part 9
§ As for <b>those eighteen</b> women that the king may marry, <b>from where do we</b> derive that number? The Gemara responds: <b>As it is written: “And to David sons were born in Hebron; and his firstborn was Amnon, from Ahinoam the Jezreelitess; and his second, Chileab, from Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom, son of Maacah,</b> the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur; <b>and the fourth, Adonijah, son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah, son of Abital; and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah, David’s wife. These were born to David in Hebron”</b> (II Samuel 3:2–5). In these verses, a total of six wives are mentioned.

### Part 10
And the <b>prophet</b> Nathan <b>said to</b> King David in his rebuke: “And I gave you your master’s house and your master’s wives into your bosom and I gave you the house of Israel and Judah; and <b>if that were too little, then I would add to you like these and like those”</b> (II Samuel 12:8). <b>“Like these”;</b> this is referring to the wives enumerated above, meaning another <b>six. “And like those”;</b> this is referring to another <b>six,</b> so <b>that</b> all together there <b>are eighteen</b> he would be permitted to marry.

### Part 11
<b>Ravina objects to this</b> explanation: <b>Say</b> instead: <b>“Like these”;</b> this is referring to an additional six, like the wives enumerated above, totaling <b>twelve. “And like those”;</b> this is referring to all of those enumerated previously, totaling <b>twenty-four.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara adds: Support for Ravina’s interpretation <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“He shall not add many wives to himself”;</b> this means he may not marry <b>more than twenty-four</b> women. The Gemara comments: <b>According to the one who interprets</b> the letter <b><i>vav</i>,</b> translated as the conjunction “and” in the term “and like those,” to add and expand upon what came before, the <i>vav</i> is written in order to add more, and therefore, <b>there are forty-eight</b> women. The Gemara comments: Support for this interpretation <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“He shall not add many wives to himself”;</b> this means he may not marry <b>more than forty-eight</b> women.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna, <b>what is his reason</b> for limiting the number to eighteen? <b>Rav Kahana says:</b> The verse <b>compares the latter</b> term: <b>“Like those [<i>kahenna</i>],” to the former</b> term: <b>“Like these [<i>kahenna</i>],”</b> teaching that <b>just as the former</b> term: <b>“Like these,”</b> means <b>six, so too, the latter</b> term: <b>“Like those,”</b> means <b>six</b> and no more.

### Part 14
The Gemara challenges the notion that David had only six wives. <b>But there was</b> also <b>Michal,</b> and so he had at least seven wives. <b>Rav said:</b> One of those six wives, <b>Eglah, is Michal, and why was she called Eglah</b> in the verse? It was <b>because she was dear to him like a calf [<i>egla</i>], and so</b> the verse <b>states</b> that Samson referred to his wife with the same term: <b>“If you had not plowed with my calf</b> you would not have found my secret” (Judges 14:18).

### Part 15
The Gemara challenges the identification of Eglah with Michal: <b>And did Michal have children? But isn’t it written: “And Michal the daughter of Saul had no child until the day of her death”</b> (II Samuel 6:23)? <b>Rav Ḥisda said: Until the day of her death she had no</b> child, but <b>on the day of her death she had</b> a child.

### Part 16
The Gemara challenges this: <b>Now,</b> these <b>children</b> of David’s, <b>where does it count them? In Hebron,</b> as Eglon was listed above with David’s wives in Hebron. <b>But the incident with Michal,</b> in the context of which the verse says she had no children, <b>was in Jerusalem, as it is written:</b> “And it was so, as the Ark of the Lord came into the city of David, <b>that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out the window and saw King David leaping and dancing before the Lord, and she despised</b> him in her heart” (II Samuel 6:16). <b>And Rav Yehuda says, and some say</b> it is <b>Rav Yosef</b> who says: <b>Michal received her punishment [<i>lemitarpesah</i>]</b> immediately, and therefore could not have had children afterward. <b>Rather, say</b> a different explanation: <b>Until that incident, she had</b> a child; <b>from that</b> point <b>forward, she did not have</b> a child.

### Part 17
The Gemara challenges the notion that David had only this limited number of wives. <b>But isn’t it written: “And David took more concubines and wives in Jerusalem</b> after he came from Hebron” (II Samuel 5:13). The Gemara responds: All of these were <b>to complete</b> the tally of <b>eighteen</b> and no more. The Gemara asks about this verse: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>“wives” and what</b> is the meaning of <b>“concubines”</b> in that verse? <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: Wives</b> receive <b>a marriage contract and betrothal; concubines are</b> taken <b>without a marriage contract and without betrothal.</b>

### Part 18
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: David had four hundred children</b> in his army, <b>and all of them were sons of beautiful women</b> taken captive from their gentile homes during war (see Deuteronomy 21:10–14). <b>And they grew</b> their hair in <b>a gentile hairstyle, and they all sat in carriages [<i>bikronot</i>] of gold. And they walked at the head of the troops, and they were the strong-arm</b> enforcers <b>of the house of David,</b> on whose loyalty David’s monarchy relied.

### Part 19
<b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> David’s daughter <b>Tamar was the daughter of a beautiful woman</b> taken captive in war and was born before her mother converted. Therefore, Tamar was not considered the daughter of David according to <i>halakha</i>. The proof of this is in what she said to Amnon, son of David, <b>as it is stated: “Now, therefore, speak, please, to the king, for he will not withhold me from you”</b> (II Samuel 13:13). <b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that <b>she was the daughter of</b> a woman David <b>married, would</b> David <b>have permitted</b> Amnon’s <b>sister to him</b> as a wife? <b>Rather, learn from</b> this verse that <b>she was the daughter of a beautiful woman</b> who converted after Tamar was born, so halakhically Tamar was not a daughter of David.

### Part 20
The Gemara continues to interpret the story of Amnon and Tamar. The verse states: <b>“And Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab, son of Shimeah, David’s brother,</b> and Jonadab was a very <b>wise man”</b> (II Samuel 13:3). <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: A wise man for wickedness.</b>

### Part 21
The verse recounts Jonadab’s words to Amnon: <b>“And he said to him: Why, son of the king, are you so becoming leaner</b> from day to day…<b>and Jonadab said to him: Lie on your bed and feign illness,</b> and when your father comes to see you, say to him: Let my sister Tamar come, please, and give me bread, <b>and she should dress the food in my sight…And she took the pan and poured them out before him”</b> (II Samuel 13:4–5, 9). <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> This means <b>that</b> Tamar <b>prepared</b> various <b>kinds of fried [<i>tiggun</i>]</b> food <b>for</b> Amnon.

### Part 22
At the end of the story, the verse states: <b>“Then Amnon hated her with exceeding, great hatred,</b> for greater was the hatred with which he hated her than the love with which he had loved her” (II Samuel 13:15). The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for Amnon’s intense hatred? <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says:</b> While he raped her, <b>a hair [<i>nima</i>]</b> of hers <b>became tied</b> around <b>his</b> penis <b>and caused him to be one whose penis has been severed. The Gemara asks: But if</b> the hair <b>became tied</b> around <b>his</b> penis, <b>what did she do?</b> Why would Amnon hold this against her? <b>Rather, say</b> that <b>she</b> intentionally <b>tied a hair around his</b> penis during intercourse, <b>and she made him one whose penis has been severed</b> in order to take revenge on him, and for this he hated her.

### Part 23
The Gemara challenges this: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rava interpret</b> a verse <b>homiletically: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And your renown went forth among the nations about your beauty”</b> (Ezekiel 16:14)? This teaches <b>that Jewish women do not have armpit hair or pubic hair.</b> Therefore, Tamar would have had no hair to injure Amnon in that way. The Gemara responds: <b>Tamar is different, as she was the daughter of a beautiful woman,</b> who was a gentile.

### Part 24
The verse relates that after Amnon raped her: <b>“And Tamar put ashes on her head and rent her garment of many colors that was on her”</b> (II Samuel 13:19). The Sages <b>taught in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa: Tamar established a great fence at that time</b> by way of her public outcry, as people <b>said:</b> If <b>such</b> an occurrence could happen <b>to the daughters of kings, all the more so</b> could it happen <b>to the daughters of ordinary</b> people. If <b>such</b> an occurrence could happen <b>to modest women</b> like Tamar, who resisted, <b>all the more so</b> could it happen <b>to licentious women. Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: At that time they decreed</b>
