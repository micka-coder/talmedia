### Part 1
<b>what does he derive from this</b> verse: <b>“She profanes her father”</b> (Leviticus 21:9), if he does not employ the term “her father” for a verbal analogy concerning a young betrothed woman who committed adultery, as Rabbi Akiva does?

### Part 2
The Gemara answers: He <b>requires it for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Meir would say: Why</b> must <b>the verse state: “She profanes her father”?</b> To teach <b>that if</b> initially <b>they would treat</b> her father in <b>a sacred</b> manner, now <b>they treat him</b> in <b>a profane</b> manner. If previously they would treat him with <b>honor,</b> they now <b>treat him</b> with <b>degradation. They say: Cursed</b> is the one <b>who bore this</b> daughter, <b>cursed</b> is the one <b>who raised this</b> daughter, <b>cursed</b> is the one <b>from whose loins this</b> daughter <b>emerged.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rav Ashi says: In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>do we call even a wicked person</b> who is <b>the son of a righteous person: A wicked person, the son of a wicked person? In accordance with whose</b> opinion is it? It <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>,</b> Rabbi Meir, who says that a sinful daughter profanes her father, and he too is treated with disgrace.

### Part 4
§ The mishna teaches: <b>This</b> describes <b>the mitzva of those who are stoned,</b> i.e., the process of execution by stoning. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> was <b>taught</b> in the mishna with regard to <b>which it teaches</b> now: <b>This</b> describes <b>the mitzva of those who are stoned?</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: The Mishna states this <b>because it teaches</b> in the previous chapter (42b): When <b>the trial has ended</b> in a guilty verdict and the condemned man has been sentenced to stoning, <b>he is taken out to be stoned.</b> And it continues (45a): <b>The place of stoning</b> from which the condemned party is pushed to his death <b>is</b> a platform <b>twice the height</b> of an ordinary person. <b>And since</b> the Mishna <b>wants to teach</b> in the next mishna: <b>The mitzva of those who are burned,</b> and it will then proceed to describe the processes involved in carrying out the other forms of execution, <b>it also teaches</b> in this mishna: <b>This</b> describes <b>the mitzva of those who are stoned,</b> in order to summarize what was taught up to this point.

### Part 6
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The mitzva of those who are burned,</b> i.e., the process of execution by burning, is carried out in the following manner: The executioners <b>submerge</b> the condemned one <b>in dung up to his knees</b> so he cannot move, <b>and they place a rough scarf within a soft one,</b> so his throat will not be wounded, <b>and wrap</b> these scarves <b>around his neck. This</b> one, i.e., one of the witnesses, <b>pulls</b> the scarf <b>toward himself, and that</b> one, the other witness, <b>pulls</b> it <b>toward himself, until</b> the condemned one is forced to <b>open his mouth,</b> as he is choking. <b>And</b> another person then <b>lights the wick and throws it into his mouth, and it goes down into his intestines and burns his intestines</b> and he dies.

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: But if this</b> one who is condemned to death by burning accidentally <b>died at their hands</b> by strangulation, <b>they have not fulfilled the mitzva of</b> execution by <b>burning for</b> this person. <b>Rather,</b> the process is carried out in the following manner: One <b>opens the mouth of</b> the condemned person <b>with prongs, against his will, and</b> one <b>lights the wick and throws it into his mouth, and it goes down into his intestines and burns his intestines</b> and he dies.

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Elazar ben Tzadok said: An incident</b> occurred <b>with regard to a certain priest’s daughter who committed adultery, and they wrapped her in bundles of branches and burned her,</b> contrary to the process described in the mishna. The Sages <b>said to him:</b> That court did not act properly; they did so <b>because the court at that time was not proficient</b> in <i>halakha</i>.

### Part 9
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What</b> kind of <b>wick</b> is the mishna referring to? <b>Rav Mattana says: A wick of lead,</b> i.e., a long, thin piece of lead in the shape of a wick, which is melted and poured down into the intestines.

### Part 10
<b>From where do we</b> derive that burning means this kind of death? <b>It is derived from</b> a verbal analogy between the <b>burning</b> that is described in the context of capital punishment (see Leviticus 21:9) and the <b>burning</b> described with regard to <b>the assembly of Korah,</b> when they were burned by God (see Numbers 17:4). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to the assembly of Korah, they were killed by <b>the burning of</b> the <b>soul</b> within the body, <b>but</b> the <b>body</b> itself remained <b>intact, so too here,</b> the condemned one is executed by <b>the burning</b> of the <b>soul, but</b> the <b>body</b> remains <b>intact.</b> He is not executed by means of the burning of the body with wood, as in that case the body would be consumed.

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> that there is a different source for this method of burning: It is <b>derived from</b> a verbal analogy between the <b>burning</b> that is described in this context and the <b>burning</b> that is described with regard to the deaths of Nadav and Avihu, <b>the sons of Aaron</b> (see Leviticus 10:6). <b>Just as there,</b> Nadav and Avihu were killed by <b>the burning of</b> the <b>soul, but</b> the <b>body</b> remained <b>intact, so too here,</b> the execution is carried out by <b>the burning of</b> the <b>soul, but</b> the <b>body</b> remains <b>intact.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>From where does the one who derives</b> that burning means this kind of death <b>from the assembly of Korah</b> derive that their bodies were not burned? The Gemara answers: He derives it from that <b>which is written: “And the firepans of these men who have sinned with their souls”</b> (Numbers 17:3), which indicates <b>that</b> only <b>their souls were burned, but</b> their <b>bodies were intact.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>the other</b> Sage, who does not derive that burning means this kind of death from here, interpret the deaths of the assembly of Korah? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> burning <b>was actual burning</b> of their bodies. <b>And what</b> is the meaning of the term: <b>“With their souls”?</b> It means <b>that they were deemed liable</b> to be killed by <b>burning due to matters of</b> sustaining <b>their souls,</b> i.e., they sinned because Korah helped them fulfill their bodily desires, and consequently they followed him.

### Part 14
This latter explanation is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Reish Lakish. As Reish Lakish says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “With the flattering mockeries of spitefulness [<i>maog</i>] they gnash at me with their teeth”</b> (Psalms 35:16)? It means that <b>because of the flattery</b> of those people <b>who flattered Korah over matters of eating,</b> i.e., because of the food and drink that he would give them, <b>the minister of Gehenna gnashed his teeth over them,</b> as they eventually sinned and fell into his hands. The word <i>maog</i> is interpreted homiletically here as alluding to <i>uga</i>, cake.

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where does the one who derives</b> that burning means this kind of death <b>from the sons of Aaron</b> derive that their bodies were not burned? The Gemara answers: He derives it from that <b>which is written:</b> “And fire came out from before the Lord, and devoured them, <b>and they died before the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 10:2). The term “and they died” indicates that it was <b>similar to</b> a natural <b>death,</b> in which the body remains intact.

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>the other</b> Sage, who does not derive that burning means this kind of death from here, interpret the death of the sons of Aaron? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> burning <b>was actual burning. And</b> in that case, <b>what</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And they died”?</b> It means <b>that</b> the fire <b>started from within them,</b> and therefore it was <b>similar to</b> a natural <b>death,</b> which occurs within the person. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Abba Yosei ben Dostai says: Two threads of fire came out of the Holy of Holies and split into four, and two entered the nostrils of this</b> one, <b>and</b> the other <b>two</b> entered <b>the nostrils of that</b> one, <b>and</b> the threads of fire <b>burned them.</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written: “And devoured them [<i>vatokhal otam</i>]”?</b> The usage of the expanded term “<i>vatokhal otam</i>,” instead of the terser <i>vatokhlem</i>, indicates a limitation, i.e., only they were consumed, to the exclusion of their bodies. The Gemara answers: The verse means that the fire devoured <b>“them,” but not their clothes.</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara asks: <b>And let us derive</b> the correct method of execution by burning <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the <b>bull</b> offerings <b>that are burned. Just as there,</b> the reference is to <b>actual burning, so too here,</b> perhaps there should be <b>actual burning.</b>

### Part 19
The Gemara answers: <b>It stands to reason</b> that <b>one should derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to capital punishment <b>from</b> the death of <b>a person,</b> i.e., either from the assembly of Korah or the sons of Aaron, <b>as</b> they share common elements: They deal with <b>a person, a sinner,</b> and <b>a soul</b> that is taken through burning, i.e., the person dies as a result of the burning. Furthermore, the <i>halakha</i> of <b>an offering that was sacrificed with the intent to consume it after its designated time [<i>piggul</i>],</b> is not relevant in either case, whereas it is relevant to bull offerings that are burned.

### Part 20
The Gemara asks: <b>On the contrary, one should derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to capital punishment <b>from</b> the <b>bull</b> offerings <b>that are burned, as</b> both <b>enable</b> the fulfillment of a mitzva, whereas the deaths of the assembly of Korah and the sons of Aaron were not mitzvot. Furthermore, both of these are fixed <i>halakhot</i> <b>for</b> all future <b>generations,</b> whereas the deaths of the assembly of Korah and the sons of Aaron were onetime incidents.

### Part 21
The Gemara answers: <b>Those</b> elements that are shared by capital punishment and the deaths of the assembly of Korah and the sons of Aaron <b>are more numerous</b> than the elements that are shared by capital punishment and the bulls that are burned. Therefore, the <i>halakha</i> is derived from the assembly of Korah and the sons of Aaron.

### Part 22
The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>the one who derives</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from the assembly of Korah, what is the reason he does not derive</b> it <b>from the sons of Aaron?</b> Because in his opinion <b>that was actual burning. But</b> if this is the case, <b>let us derive from</b> the death of the sons of Aaron that execution by burning should be performed with actual burning; why does he derive from the assembly of Korah that hot lead should be used?

### Part 23
<b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says:</b> The <b>verse states: “And you shall love your neighbor as yourself”</b> (Leviticus 19:18), which teaches that even with regard to a condemned prisoner one should <b>select a good,</b> i.e., a compassionate, <b>death for him.</b> The method of burning described in the mishna is certainly faster and less painful than the burning of the entire body.

### Part 24
The Gemara asks: <b>And since there is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>of Rav Naḥman, why do I</b> need the <b>verbal analogy?</b> Even without this proof execution by burning would have been performed with hot lead, as it is a less painful form of death.

### Part 25
The Gemara answers: <b>Were it not</b> for the <b>verbal analogy, I would say</b> that a death that includes <b>the burning of</b> the <b>soul, but</b> the <b>body</b> itself remains <b>intact, is not burning at all,</b> and that it does not fulfill the mitzva of execution by burning. <b>And if</b> it is necessary to alleviate the condemned one’s pain <b>due to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>“And you shall love your neighbor as yourself” (Leviticus 19:18), let</b> the court <b>increase for him the bundles of branches, so that he will burn quicker.</b> Therefore, the verbal analogy <b>teaches us</b> that even internal burning is regarded as burning, and once this has been established it is taken into consideration that he must be executed in the least painful way.

### Part 26
Apropos the deaths of Nadav and Avihu, an aggadic midrash on this subject is quoted: <b>And</b> it had <b>already</b> happened that <b>Moses and Aaron were walking on</b> their <b>way, and Nadav and Avihu were walking behind them, and the entire Jewish people</b> were walking <b>behind them. Nadav said to Avihu: When will</b> it happen that <b>these two old men will die and you and I will lead the generation,</b> as we are their heirs? <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to them: We shall see who buries whom. Rav Pappa says: This</b> explains the adage <b>that people say: Many are the old camels that are loaded with the skins of young camels.</b>
