### Part 1
<b>These matters never occurred,</b> i.e., I never admitted to this, the defendant <b>assumes the presumptive status of one who</b> falsely <b>denies</b> his debts, as the witnesses heard his admission. Consequently, he is not trusted to take an oath that he is exempt.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Pappa, son of Rav Aḥa bar Adda, says: This</b> is what <b>we say in the name of Rava:</b> The defendant is not rendered a liar, because <b>people do not remember all frivolous matters.</b> Since the admission was not made seriously, perhaps the defendant forgot the incident. Therefore, his denial of its having occurred was not necessarily an outright lie.

### Part 3
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> man <b>who hid witnesses in</b> the <b>canopy</b> above <b>his</b> bed <b>to</b> hear the statement of <b>another.</b> That certain man <b>said to him: I</b> have <b>one hundred dinars in your possession.</b> The latter <b>said to him: Yes.</b> The claimant then <b>said: Let those awake and those asleep bear witness about you,</b> hoping to induce him to agree to this testimony, as the respondent might assume that everyone was asleep. The latter <b>said to him: No.</b> When the matter came to court <b>Rav Kahana said:</b> Since <b>he said no to him,</b> his admission did not render him liable.

### Part 4
The Gemara relates another incident: There was <b>a certain</b> man <b>who hid witnesses in a grave to</b> hear the statement of <b>another.</b> That certain man <b>said to him: I</b> have <b>one hundred dinars in your possession.</b> The latter <b>said to him: Yes.</b> The claimant then <b>said: Let the living and the dead bear witness about you.</b> The respondent <b>said to him: No. Rabbi Shimon said:</b> Since <b>he said no to him,</b> his admission did not render him liable.

### Part 5
<b>Ravina said, and some say Rav Pappa</b> said it: <b>Conclude from it</b> that with regard to <b>that which Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says,</b> that one <b>needs to say</b> to the witnesses of the admission: <b>You are my witnesses,</b> there <b>is no difference whether the debtor said</b> it, <b>and</b> there <b>is no difference whether the creditor said</b> it <b>and the debtor remained silent.</b> The inference is that <b>the reason</b> the Sages deemed the purported debtor exempt in the above cases <b>is that the debtor</b> explicitly <b>said no,</b> i.e., that he does not accept the witnesses, <b>but had he remained silent</b> his admission would have <b>indeed</b> rendered him liable.

### Part 6
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> man <b>whom</b> people <b>called: A <i>kav</i> of debts,</b> as everyone claimed debts from him, who once <b>said: Who can claim</b> debts <b>from me, other than so-and-so and so-and-so?</b> I do not owe money to as many as assumed. Those whom he admitted that he owed <b>came</b> and <b>took him to judgment before Rav Naḥman</b> to claim what he owed them, and he responded in court that his admittance was in jest.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Naḥman said: A person is prone</b> to make false statements <b>so as not to make himself</b> appear <b>sated,</b> i.e., it is possible that he might say falsely in public that he owes money in order that he should not be considered wealthy. Therefore, as long as he has not made a proper admission that he owes a specific sum to a specific individual, he is not liable.

### Part 8
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> man <b>whom</b> people <b>called: A mouse that lies on dinars,</b> as he was a miser who did not benefit from his money, like a mouse that sits and safeguards gold dinars. This man <b>said on his deathbed: So-and-so and so-and-so claim dinars from me. After he died,</b> they <b>came</b> and <b>sued the heirs.</b>

### Part 9
<b>They came</b> to judgment <b>before Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei. He said to them: When we say a person is prone</b> to make false statements <b>so as not to make himself</b> appear <b>sated, this statement</b> applies to an admission <b>during his lifetime. But after death,</b> i.e., on his deathbed, this does <b>not</b> apply; rather, we presume he told the truth.

### Part 10
The heirs <b>paid half</b> the amount of the claim. The claimants then <b>sued them for the other half. They came</b> to judgment <b>before Rabbi Ḥiyya.</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>said to them: Just as a person is prone</b> to make false statements <b>so as not to make himself</b> appear <b>sated, so too, a person is prone</b> to make false statements <b>so as not to make his sons</b> appear <b>sated.</b> One might claim falsely on his deathbed that he owes money so that his children will not be considered wealthy. Therefore, there is no room for a claim against the heirs. The heirs then <b>said to him:</b> If so, <b>let us go and overturn</b> the former verdict, and retrieve the amount we paid the claimants. Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>said to them: The elder,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, <b>has already issued a ruling</b> in this case, and it is not in my power to overturn his ruling.

### Part 11
§ If one <b>made an admission in the presence of two</b> witnesses that he owes money <b>and they performed</b> a formal <b>act of acquisition with him</b> to verify the admission, the witnesses <b>can write</b> a record of the admission in a document and sign it, thereby granting the creditor more rights. <b>But if</b> they did <b>not</b> perform a formal act of acquisition <b>they may not write</b> a record of the admission in a document, as the debtor presumably wants the loan to retain its status as a loan by oral agreement, which grants fewer rights to the creditor than a loan with a promissory note.

### Part 12
If he made an admission <b>in the presence of three</b> witnesses <b>and they did not perform</b> a formal <b>act of acquisition with him, Rav Ami says: They can write</b> a record of the admission in a document. Since the admission was made in the presence of three individuals, who are considered a court, it is permitted for a court to write its verdicts. <b>And Rav Asi says: They may not write</b> it in a document; perhaps the debtor intended for them to serve only as witnesses, not as a court. <b>There was an incident</b> in which a person admitted his debt before three witnesses, <b>and Rav was concerned for this</b> opinion <b>of Rav Asi,</b> and ruled that they may not write a record of the admission.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Adda bar Ahava says:</b> With regard to <b>this</b> document of <b>admission, sometimes we write</b> it <b>and sometimes we do not write</b> it. If the three witnesses were <b>gathered and sitting</b> when the debtor made his admission before them, <b>we do not write</b> it, as perhaps he did not intend for them to serve as a court. But if the debtor <b>gathered them, we write</b> the document of admission, as the fact that he took care to bring three people and not just two proves that he intended for them to serve as a court.

### Part 14
<b>Rava says: Even</b> if <b>he gathered them we do not write</b> it, <b>unless he says to them: Be my judges.</b>

### Part 15
<b>Mar bar Rav Ashi says: Even</b> if <b>he says: Be my judges, we do not write</b> it <b>unless they establish a place</b> for judgment <b>and send</b> messengers <b>and summon him to court.</b> Unless the entire procedure of an admission in court is implemented, the debtor may not have intended that they serve as a court with regard to this matter.

### Part 16
If <b>he made an admission with regard to movable property</b> that he owes, <b>and</b> the witnesses <b>performed</b> a formal <b>act of acquisition with him, they can write</b> a record of the admission in a document; <b>but if</b> they did <b>not</b> perform a formal act of acquisition <b>they may not write</b> a record of the admission. But if he made an admission <b>with regard to land, and they did not perform</b> a formal <b>act of acquisition with him, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Is it considered as though an act of acquisition was performed, as land is always available for collection? <b>Ameimar says: They may not write</b> it. <b>Mar Zutra says: They may write</b> it. <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>they may write</b> it.

### Part 17
<b>Ravina happened</b> to come <b>to Damharya. Rav Dimi bar Rav Huna of Damharya said to Ravina:</b> If one makes an admission that he owes <b>movable property that is extant,</b> i.e., it is available to be taken immediately, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Should it be considered like land, as it is similarly available for collection, and therefore the witnesses can write a record of the admission? Ravina <b>said to him: It is</b> considered <b>like land. Rav Ashi says: Since it</b> still <b>lacks collection,</b> i.e., it has not been physically transferred from one party to the other, it is not considered like land, and the witnesses <b>may not</b> write a record of the admission unless the debtor asks them to write it.

### Part 18
§ With regard to <b>a certain</b> document of <b>admission in which</b> the following statement <b>was not written: He,</b> the one making the admission, <b>said to us: Write</b> a deed, <b>and sign</b> it, <b>and give</b> it <b>to</b> the creditor, <b>Abaye and Rava both say</b> that <b>this is</b> a case in which the principle <b>of Reish Lakish</b> is applicable.

### Part 19
<b>As Reish Lakish says:</b> There is <b>a presumption</b> that <b>witnesses do not sign on the document unless</b> the deal <b>was transacted with</b> each party being <b>an adult,</b> even if it is not mentioned explicitly in the document that the witnesses verified this. This reflects the principle that a document is not written by a scribe and signed by witnesses unless they know that the action to which it attests was performed appropriately. In light of this, the fact that a certain detail is missing from the wording of the document does not prove that the detail did not take place, as the action was presumably performed properly. Consequently, a document of admission lacking the sentence: He said to us: Write a deed, and sign it, and give it to the creditor, is valid.

### Part 20
<b>Rav Pappi objects to this, and some say</b> it is <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua,</b> who raises this objection: <b>Is there anything that we,</b> the Sages, <b>do not know, and the scribes of the court</b> do <b>know?</b> Since not all of the Sages are aware that the witnesses of an admission cannot write a deed of admission unless the one making the admission asks them to, the scribes certainly cannot be expected to ensure that this condition is fulfilled.

### Part 21
The Gemara relates that <b>Abaye’s scribes were asked</b> whether they were aware of this <i>halakha</i>, <b>and</b> they answered that <b>they were aware</b> of it. <b>Rava’s scribes</b> were also asked, <b>and they were</b> also <b>aware</b> of it. Apparently, since writing documents is their profession, scribes are aware of the relevant <i>halakhot</i>.

### Part 22
The Gemara recounts: There was <b>a certain</b> document of <b>admission in which</b> it <b>was written</b> that it was <b>a record of the proceedings</b> that took place in the presence of the witnesses,
