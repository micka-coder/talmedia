### Part 1
<b>as there is no palm</b> tree <b>that is in Babylonia to which a horse of the Persians will not be tethered</b> when the Persians and Medes go to conquer other lands. <b>And there is no coffin</b> buried <b>in Eretz Yisrael from which a Median horse will not eat straw.</b> During wars, all the coffins will be removed from the ground and used as animal troughs. I do not want my coffin to be used for that purpose.

### Part 2
<b>Rav says: The son of David will not come until the evil</b> Roman <b>kingdom will disperse throughout Eretz Yisrael for nine months, as it is stated: “Therefore will He give them up, until the time when she who is in labor has given birth; then the remnant of his brethren shall return with the children of Israel”</b> (Micah 5:2). Once a period equivalent to a term of pregnancy passes, the redemption will come.

### Part 3
§ <b>Ulla says: Let</b> the Messiah <b>come, but</b> after my death, so that <b>I will not see him,</b> as I fear the suffering that will precede his coming. <b>Likewise, Rabba says: Let</b> the Messiah <b>come, but</b> after my death, so that <b>I will not see him. Rav Yosef says: Let</b> the Messiah <b>come, and I will be privileged to sit in the shadow of his donkey’s excrement.</b> I am willing to undergo all the pain and disgrace associated with his arrival.

### Part 4
<b>Abaye said to Rabba: What is the reason</b> that you are so concerned? <b>If we say it is due to the pains</b> preceding and accompanying the coming <b>of the Messiah, but isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that Rabbi Elazar’s <b>students asked Rabbi Elazar: What shall a person do to be spared from the pains</b> preceding the coming <b>of</b> the <b>Messiah? Rabbi Elazar</b> said to them: <b>They shall engage in Torah</b> study <b>and acts of kindness.</b> Abaye continued: <b>And</b> as far as <b>the Master</b> is concerned, <b>isn’t there</b> the <b>Torah and aren’t there</b> the <b>acts of kindness</b> that you performed?

### Part 5
Rabba <b>said to him:</b> I am concerned <b>lest sin cause</b> me to suffer the pain despite the Torah study and the good deeds in which I engage, <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi. As Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi raises a contradiction. It is written</b> that God said to Jacob: <b>“And I am with you, and will keep you wherever you go”</b> (Genesis 28:15), <b>and it is written: “And Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed”</b> (Genesis 32:7). If God assured Jacob that He would keep him, why was he concerned?

### Part 6
Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi explains: <b>He was afraid lest sin</b> on his part <b>cause</b> that assurance to be abrogated, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “Until Your people pass over, Lord, until Your people, whom You have acquired, pass over” (Exodus 15:16). <b>“Until Your people pass over, Lord”; this is</b> a reference to <b>the first entry</b> into the land, led by Joshua. <b>“Until Your people, whom You have acquired, pass over”; this is</b> a reference to <b>the second entry</b> into the land, when they returned to Zion from Babylonia.

### Part 7
Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi explains: <b>Say from now,</b> based on this statement, that <b>the Jewish people were worthy</b> for God <b>to perform a miracle on their</b> behalf <b>in the second entry</b> into the land that was <b>like</b> the miracles that were performed during the exodus from Egypt and <b>the first entry</b> into the land, <b>but the sin caused</b> the second entry to take place in an unremarkable manner, with the Jewish people being subject to the dominion of the gentiles.

### Part 8
<b>And so</b> too <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Let</b> the Messiah <b>come, but</b> after my death, so that <b>I will not see him. Reish Lakish said to him: What is the reason</b> that you are concerned? <b>If we say it is because it is written</b> with regard to the day of God: <b>“As when a man did flee from a lion and a bear met him, or went into the house and leaned his arm on the wall and a snake bit him”</b> (Amos 5:19), that is not a reason. <b>Come, and I will show you a counterpart in this world</b> to the situation described in this verse, as even today one encounters those situations. <b>At a time when a person goes out to the field and is accosted by a guard [<i>santar</i>]</b> who demands payment, his situation <b>is similar to</b> that of <b>one who is accosted by a lion. He</b> then <b>enters the city and is accosted by</b> a royal <b>tax collector.</b> His situation <b>is similar to</b> that of <b>one who is accosted by a bear. He</b> then <b>enters his house and finds his sons and daughters afflicted with famine.</b> His situation <b>is similar to</b> that of <b>one whom a snake bit.</b>

### Part 9
Rabbi Yoḥanan said to him: <b>Rather,</b> the reason I am concerned is <b>that it is written</b> with regard to the day of God: <b>“Ask now, and see whether a man gives birth. Why, then, do I see every man [<i>kol gever</i>] with his hands on his loins, as a woman in labor, and all faces turned green?”</b> (Jeremiah 30:6).

### Part 10
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase <b>“I see <i>kol gever</i>”? Rava bar Yitzḥak says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> It is a reference to <b>He Whom all strength is His.</b> It is as though even God will suffer like a woman in labor due to the troubles of the Jewish people. <b>And what</b> is the meaning of the phrase <b>“And all faces turned green”? Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The reference is to the heavenly <b>entourage above,</b> i.e., angels, <b>and</b> the earthly <b>entourage below,</b> i.e., the Jewish people, who will all suffer <b>at the time when the Holy One, Blessed be He, says: These,</b> the Jewish people, <b>are My handiwork, and those,</b> the gentiles, <b>are My handiwork. How shall I destroy those on account of these?</b> It appears that the Holy One, Blessed be He, does not distinguish between the Jewish people and the gentiles. That is why Rabbi Yoḥanan was concerned with regard to the coming of the Messiah.

### Part 11
<b>Rav Pappa says</b> that <b>this</b> is in accordance with the adage <b>that people say: An ox runs and falls, and</b> its owner <b>goes and casts a horse in its place.</b> Although the horse is an inferior work animal relative to the ox, when there is no ox available, a horse must suffice. So too, after the Jewish people sin, it is as though the Holy One, Blessed be He, transfers their prominence to the gentiles.

### Part 12
§ <b>Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rav says: The Jewish people are destined to eat</b> from the bounty of, i.e., enjoy, <b>the years of</b> the <b>Messiah. Rav Yosef says:</b> Isn’t this <b>obvious? And rather, who</b> else <b>will eat</b> from <b>them?</b> Will <b>Ḥillak and Billak,</b> two shiftless characters, <b>eat</b> from <b>them?</b> The Gemara explains that Rav Giddel’s statement serves <b>to exclude</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Hillel, who says: There is no Messiah</b> coming <b>for the Jewish people, as they already ate</b> from <b>him,</b> as all the prophecies relating to the Messiah were already fulfilled <b>during the days of Hezekiah.</b>

### Part 13
<b>Rav says: The world was created only for</b> the sake of <b>David,</b> by virtue of his merit. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> It was created by virtue of the merit of <b>Moses. And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It was created by virtue of the merit of the <b>Messiah.</b>

### Part 14
Apropos the Messiah, the Gemara asks: <b>What is his name? The school of Rabbi Sheila says: Shiloh is his name, as it is stated: “Until when Shiloh shall come”</b> (Genesis 49:10). <b>The school of Rabbi Yannai says: Yinnon is his name, as it is stated: “May his name endure forever; may his name continue [<i>yinnon</i>] as long as the sun;</b> and may men bless themselves by him” (Psalms 72:17). <b>The school of Rabbi Ḥanina says: Ḥanina is his name, as it is stated: “For I will show you no favor [<i>ḥanina</i>]”</b> (Jeremiah 16:13). <b>And some say</b> that <b>Menaḥem ben Ḥizkiyya is his name, as it is stated: “Because the comforter [<i>menaḥem</i>] that should relieve my soul is far from me”</b> (Lamentations 1:16). <b>And the Rabbis say: The leper of the house of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>is his name, as it is stated: “Indeed our illnesses he did bear and our pains he endured; yet we did esteem him injured, stricken by God, and afflicted”</b> (Isaiah 53:4).

### Part 15
<b>Rav Naḥman says: If</b> the Messiah <b>is among the living</b> in this generation, he is a person <b>such as me,</b> who already has dominion over the Jewish people, <b>as it is stated: “And their prince shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from their midst”</b> (Jeremiah 30:21), indicating that the redeemer is already in power. <b>Rav says: If</b> the Messiah <b>is among the living</b> in this generation, he is a person <b>such as our saintly Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, who was renowned for his sanctity, piety, and Torah knowledge. <b>If</b> the Messiah <b>is among the dead</b> he is a person <b>such as Daniel, the beloved man.</b>

### Part 16
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: The Holy One, Blessed be He, is destined to establish another David</b> for the Jewish people as the Messiah, <b>as it is stated: “And they shall serve the Lord their God, and David their king, whom I will establish for them”</b> (Jeremiah 30:9). <b>It is not stated: I established, but “I will establish,”</b> indicating that the name of the future king will be David. <b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: But isn’t it written: “And my servant David shall be their prince forever”</b> (Ezekiel 37:25), indicating that King David himself will rule over the Jewish people? Abaye said: They will rule in tandem <b>like an emperor and a viceroy;</b> the Messiah will be king and David will be second-in-command.

### Part 17
§ <b>Rabbi Simlai taught: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Woe to you who desire the day of the Lord. Why would you have this day of the Lord? It is darkness, and not light”</b> (Amos 5:18)? It is <b>comparable to a rooster and a bat who were looking forward to</b> the <b>light</b> of day. <b>The rooster said to the bat: I look forward to light, as light is</b> an indication of <b>my</b> time to be active. <b>But</b> as for <b>you, why do you</b> need <b>light?</b> Nighttime for you is like daytime for me.
