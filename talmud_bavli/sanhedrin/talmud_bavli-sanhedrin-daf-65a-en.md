### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The list of those liable to be executed by stoning includes those who practice various types of sorcery. The mishna describes them: <b>A necromancer is a <i>pitom</i> from whose armpit</b> the voice of the dead appears to <b>speak. And a sorcerer is</b> one <b>from whose mouth</b> the dead appears to <b>speak. These,</b> the necromancer and the sorcerer, <b>are</b> executed <b>by stoning, and one who inquires</b> about the future <b>through them is in</b> violation of <b>a prohibition.</b>

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What is different here, that</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of both <b>a necromancer and a sorcerer, and what is different in</b> tractate <b><i>Karetot</i></b> (2a), <b>that</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a necromancer but leaves out</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a sorcerer?</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The mishna in tractate <i>Karetot</i> does not count a sorcerer separately in the list of those liable to receive <i>karet</i> <b>since both</b> a necromancer and a sorcerer <b>are stated</b> in the Torah <b>in one prohibition.</b> Consequently, one who unwittingly serves as both a necromancer and a sorcerer is not obligated to bring two sin-offerings, as would be one who transgressed two prohibitions punishable by <i>karet</i>.

### Part 4
<b>Reish Lakish says: A sorcerer</b> is not included in the list in tractate <i>Karetot</i> <b>because</b> his transgression <b>does not involve an action;</b> it involves only speech, and one does not bring a sin-offering for transgressing a prohibition that does not involve an action.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> that a sorcerer is not listed because sorcery is included in the same prohibition as that of necromancy, <b>what is different</b> about <b>a necromancer that</b> the mishna <b>uses</b> specifically that example, and not the example of a sorcerer? The Gemara answers: The mishna chooses to mention the example of a necromancer <b>because the verse introduces</b> the prohibition <b>with it;</b> the case of a sorcerer is mentioned in the verse afterward (see Deuteronomy 18:11).

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> that <b>Reish Lakish did not say</b> an explanation <b>in accordance with</b> the explanation of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan? Rav Pappa says:</b> Reish Lakish disagrees with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>because</b> the cases of a necromancer and a sorcerer <b>are divided</b> in the verse <b>with regard to</b> the issue of the <b>death</b> penalty, i.e., one is liable to receive the death penalty for each transgression. Consequently, one would be obligated to bring a separate sin-offering for sorcery were it not for the fact that this transgression does not involve an action.

### Part 7
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> could respond that one cannot infer the number of sin-offerings one is obligated to bring based on capital punishment. With regard to determining the number of sin-offerings, where there is <b>a division of a prohibition,</b> i.e., when two acts are listed as two separate prohibitions, it <b>is considered a division</b> that leads to a separate sin-offering, but where there is a division <b>of</b> a separate <b>death</b> penalty, i.e., when the death penalties are listed separately, it <b>is not considered a division</b> in this regard.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan did not say</b> an explanation <b>in accordance with</b> the explanation of <b>Reish Lakish,</b> that a sorcerer is not listed in tractate <i>Karetot</i> because his transgression does not involve an action? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yoḥanan could have <b>said to you</b> that <b>the mishna of</b> tractate <b><i>Karetot</i> is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who says</b> that <b>we do not require an action</b> for one to be obligated to bring a sin-offering.

### Part 9
<b>And Reish Lakish</b> could have responded that <b>although Rabbi Akiva does not require</b> that one perform <b>a significant action</b> to be obligated to bring a sin-offering; nevertheless, <b>he does require</b> that one perform at least <b>a minor action.</b> Sorcery, by contrast, involves no action, and therefore even Rabbi Akiva would not deem one obligated to bring a sin-offering for it.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: In the case of <b>a blasphemer,</b> i.e., one who curses God, <b>what action is there?</b> He merely speaks, and nevertheless Rabbi Akiva deems him obligated to bring a sin-offering. Clearly, Rabbi Akiva maintains that no action is necessary at all. The Gemara answers: <b>The twisting of his lips</b> while he speaks <b>is</b> considered <b>an action.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>What action is there</b> in the case of <b>a necromancer?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The striking of his arms</b> against each other in order to create the sound of a voice <b>is</b> considered <b>an action.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is this considered an action <b>even according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who require a significant action for one to be obligated to bring a sin-offering? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>is liable</b> for idol worship <b>only for a matter that involves an action, e.g., sacrificing</b> an idolatrous offering, <b>burning</b> incense to an idol, <b>and pouring</b> a libation to an idol, <b>and bowing</b> to an idol.

### Part 13
<b>And Reish Lakish says: Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught bowing</b> among these examples? <b>It is Rabbi Akiva, who says: We do not require</b> a significant <b>action</b> for one to be liable; any action is sufficient. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> as <b>the bending of one’s height, according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, is</b> considered a significant <b>action.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Now</b> consider, if <b>according to Reish Lakish, the bending of one’s height is not</b> considered a significant <b>action according to the Rabbis,</b> can a less noticeable action such as <b>the striking of the necromancer’s arms be</b> considered a significant <b>action?</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara answers: Reish Lakish concedes that according to the Rabbis, the striking of the necromancer’s arms is not considered a significant action. <b>When Reish Lakish says</b> that it is considered an action, that statement is <b>also in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva. But according to the Rabbis,</b> it is <b>not</b> considered a significant action.

### Part 16
The Gemara challenges: <b>If so,</b> that the Rabbis hold that the transgression of a necromancer does not involve an action, then when stating in tractate <i>Karetot</i> (2a) that if one unwittingly transgresses a prohibition for which one is liable to receive <i>karet</i> if he transgresses it intentionally he is obligated to bring a sin-offering, excluding a blasphemer, as he does not perform an action, the Rabbis <b>should have</b> stated: <b>Excluding a blasphemer and a necromancer,</b> as they do not perform an action.

### Part 17
<b>Rather, Ulla says:</b> The reason the Rabbis do not state: Excluding a blasphemer and a necromancer, is that when the mishna there lists the case of a necromancer it is referring <b>to one who burns</b> incense <b>to a demon</b> in order to raise the dead, which is a significant action.

### Part 18
<b>Rava said to</b> Ulla: <b>One who burns</b> incense <b>to a demon is an idol worshipper,</b> which is already mentioned in the mishna in <i>Karetot</i>. <b>Rather, Rava says:</b> The mishna there is referring <b>to one who burns</b> incense to the demons not as a form of worship but as a manner of sorcery, in order <b>to gather</b> the demons, i.e., to bring them to one place.

### Part 19
<b>Abaye said to</b> Ulla: <b>One who burns</b> incense to the demons in order <b>to gather</b> them <b>is</b> considered <b>a charmer,</b> whom the Torah relates to with a distinct prohibition (see Deuteronomy 18:11), which is not punishable by <i>karet</i>.

### Part 20
Rava responded: <b>Yes,</b> such a person is also considered a charmer, <b>but the Torah states</b> that <b>this</b> particular <b>charmer,</b> who gathers demons, is included in the category of a necromancer, and therefore he is executed <b>by stoning,</b> and <i>karet</i> applies as well.

### Part 21
<b>The Sages taught</b> with regard to <b>a charmer</b> that the prohibition applies <b>both</b> to <b>a gathering of large</b> animals to one place <b>and</b> to <b>a gathering of small</b> animals to one place, <b>and even</b> to a gathering of <b>snakes and scorpions.</b>

### Part 22
<b>Abaye says: Therefore,</b> with regard to <b>this</b> person, <b>who</b> through sorcery <b>gathers a hornet and a scorpion</b> to harm each other, he is nevertheless <b>prohibited</b> from doing so <b>even if he intends to prevent them from harming</b> him.

### Part 23
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who holds that according to the Rabbis one is liable for bowing to an idol but not for blaspheming, <b>what is different</b> between these cases, leading to the conclusion <b>that the bending of one’s height</b> while bowing <b>is</b> considered <b>an action according to the Rabbis, but</b> a blasphemer’s <b>twisting of his lips</b> to speak <b>is not</b> considered <b>an action?</b>

### Part 24
<b>Rava says:</b> The case of <b>a blasphemer is different, since</b> this transgression <b>is in the heart</b> as well. The sin of blasphemy does not apply to speech alone, as the blasphemer’s intention is central to the transgression; if he spoke without intention he is not considered a blasphemer. Consequently, one is not obligated to bring a sin-offering for such an action, as it is essentially a sin of the heart.
