### Part 1
The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rabbi Akiva learn</b> these <i>halakhot</i> <b>from Rabbi Yehoshua? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>When Rabbi Eliezer took ill, Rabbi Akiva and his colleagues came to visit him. He was sitting on his canopied bed [<i>bekinof</i> ], and they were sitting in his parlor [<i>biteraklin</i>];</b> they did not know if he would be able to receive them, due to his illness.

### Part 2
<b>And that day was Shabbat eve, and</b> Rabbi Eliezer’s <b>son Hyrcanus entered to remove his phylacteries,</b> as phylacteries are not worn on Shabbat. His father <b>berated him, and he left reprimanded.</b> Hyrcanus <b>said to his</b> father’s <b>colleagues: It appears to me that father went insane,</b> since he berated me for no reason. Rabbi Eliezer heard this and <b>said to them: He,</b> Hyrcanus, <b>and his mother went insane. How can they neglect</b> Shabbat preparations with regard to <b>prohibitions</b> punishable by <b>stoning,</b> such as lighting the candles and preparing hot food, <b>and engage in</b> preparations concerning <b>prohibitions by rabbinic decree,</b> such as wearing phylacteries on Shabbat?

### Part 3
<b>Since the Sages perceived</b> from this retort <b>that his mind was stable, they entered and sat before him at a distance of four cubits,</b> as he was ostracized (see <i>Bava Metzia</i> 59b). It is forbidden to sit within four cubits of an ostracized person.

### Part 4
Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to them: Why have you come? They said to him: We have come to study Torah,</b> as they did not want to say that they came to visit him due to his illness. Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to them: And why have you not come until now? They said to him: We did not have spare time.</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to them: I would be surprised if these</b> Sages <b>die their own death,</b> i.e., a natural death. Rather, they will be tortured to death by the Romans. <b>Rabbi Akiva said to him: How will my</b> death come about? Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to him: Your</b> death will be <b>worse than theirs,</b> as you were my primary student and you did not come to study.

### Part 5
Rabbi Eliezer <b>raised his two arms and placed them on his heart,</b> and he <b>said: Woe to you, my two arms, as they are like two Torah scrolls that are</b> now <b>being rolled up,</b> and will never be opened again. <b>I have learned much Torah, and I have taught much Torah. I have learned much Torah, and I have not taken away from my teachers,</b> i.e., I have not received from their wisdom, <b>even like a dog lapping from the sea. I have taught much Torah, and my students have taken away from me,</b> i.e., they have received from my wisdom, <b>only like</b> the tiny amount that <b>a paintbrush</b> removes <b>from a tube</b> of paint.

### Part 6
<b>Moreover, I can teach three hundred <i>halakhot</i> with regard to a snow-white leprous mark [<i>bebaheret</i>], but no person has ever asked me anything about them.</b> He could not find a student who could fully understand him in those matters. <b>Moreover, I can teach three hundred <i>halakhot</i>, and some say</b> that Rabbi Eliezer said <b>three thousand <i>halakhot</i>, with regard to the planting of cucumbers</b> by sorcery, <b>but no person has ever asked me anything about them, besides Akiva ben Yosef.</b>

### Part 7
Rabbi Eliezer described the incident: <b>Once he and I were walking along the way,</b> and <b>he said to me: My teacher, teach me about the planting of cucumbers. I said one statement</b> of sorcery, and <b>the entire field became filled with cucumbers. He said to me: My teacher, you have taught me</b> about <b>planting them; teach me</b> about <b>uprooting them. I said one statement and they all were gathered to one place.</b>

### Part 8
After these comments, the Sages <b>asked him</b> questions of <i>halakha</i>: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i>, with regard to ritual impurity, of <b>a ball</b> made of leather and stuffed with rags, <b>and</b> likewise <b>a last,</b> the frame on which a shoe is fashioned, which is made of leather and stuffed with rags, <b>and</b> likewise <b>an amulet</b> wrapped in leather, <b>and a pouch for pearls,</b> wrapped in leather, <b>and a small weight,</b> which is wrapped in leather? Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to them: They are susceptible to impurity, and their purification is</b> effected by immersing them in a ritual bath <b>as they are,</b> as there is no need to open them up.

### Part 9
They asked him further: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a shoe that is on a last?</b> Is it considered a complete vessel, which needs no further preparation, and is therefore susceptible to impurity? Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to them: It is pure, and</b> with this word, <b>his soul left</b> him <b>in purity. Rabbi Yehoshua stood on his feet and said: The vow is permitted; the vow is permitted;</b> i.e., the ostracism that was placed on Rabbi Eliezer is removed.

### Part 10
Rabbi Akiva was not present at the time of his death. <b>At the conclusion of Shabbat, Rabbi Akiva encountered</b> the funeral procession on his way <b>from Caesarea to Lod.</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>was striking his flesh</b> in terrible anguish and regret <b>until his blood flowed to the earth. He began to</b> eulogize Rabbi Eliezer <b>in the row</b> of those comforting the mourners, <b>and said: “My father, my father, the chariot of Israel and its horsemen”</b> (II Kings 2:12). <b>I have many coins, but I do not have a money changer</b> to whom <b>to give them,</b> i.e., I have many questions, but after your death I have no one who can answer them.

### Part 11
The Gemara returns to the matter at hand: <b>Apparently,</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>learned</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of gathering cucumbers through sorcery <b>from Rabbi Eliezer,</b> not from Rabbi Yehoshua. The Gemara answers: <b>He learned it from Rabbi Eliezer but he did not understand it. Later he learned it from Rabbi Yehoshua, and</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>explained it to him.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>How could</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>have performed that</b> act of sorcery? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that <b>one who performs an act</b> of sorcery <b>is liable?</b> The Gemara answers: Performing sorcery not in order to use it, but in order <b>to teach oneself</b> the <i>halakhot</i> <b>is different,</b> and it is permitted; <b>as the Master says</b> that it is derived from the verse: <b>“You shall not learn to do</b> like the abominations of those nations. There shall not be found among you…one who uses divination, a soothsayer, an enchanter, or a sorcerer” (Deuteronomy 18:9–10), so that <b>you shall not learn,</b> i.e., it is prohibited for you to learn, in order <b>to do, but you may learn,</b> i.e., it is permitted for you to learn, in order <b>to understand</b> the matter yourself <b>and teach</b> it to others.
