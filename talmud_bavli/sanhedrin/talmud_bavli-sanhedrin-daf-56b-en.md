### Part 1
<b>Rabbi Ḥananya ben Gamla says:</b> The descendants of Noah are <b>also</b> commanded <b>concerning</b> the prohibition against consuming <b>the blood from a living</b> animal. <b>Rabbi Ḥideka says:</b> They are <b>also</b> commanded <b>concerning castration,</b> i.e., they are prohibited to castrate any living animal. <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> They are <b>also</b> commanded <b>concerning</b> the prohibition against engaging in <b>sorcery.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> With regard to <b>every</b> type of sorcery <b>that is stated in the passage about sorcery,</b> it is <b>prohibited for a descendant of Noah to</b> engage in <b>it.</b> This is derived from the verses: “When you come into the land that the Lord your God gives you, you shall not learn to do like the abominations of those nations. <b>There shall not be found among you one who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire, a diviner, a soothsayer, or an enchanter, or a warlock, or a charmer, or one who consults a necromancer and a sorcerer, or directs inquiries to the dead.</b> For whoever does these things is an abomination to the Lord; <b>and because of these abominations, the Lord your God is driving them out from before you”</b> (Deuteronomy 18:9–12). Evidently, the Canaanites were punished for these practices; <b>and</b> since God <b>would not have punished</b> them for an action <b>unless He</b> first <b>prohibited</b> it, these practices are clearly prohibited to gentiles.

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The descendants of Noah were <b>also</b> commanded <b>concerning</b> the prohibition of <b>diverse kinds.</b> Nevertheless, it is <b>permitted for the descendants of Noah to wear diverse kinds</b> of wool and linen <b>and to sow diverse kinds</b> of seeds together, <b>and they are prohibited only with regard to breeding</b> diverse species of <b>animals and grafting</b> diverse species of <b>trees.</b>

### Part 4
§ The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters,</b> the Noahide mitzvot, derived? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It is from that <b>which the verse states: “And the Lord God commanded the man, saying: Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat;</b> but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat from it, for on the day that you eat from it, you shall die” (Genesis 2:16–17).

### Part 5
The verse is interpreted homiletically as follows: With regard to the term <b>“and…commanded,” these are the</b> courts of <b>judgment; and so it states</b> in another verse: <b>“For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children</b> and his household after him, that they may keep the way of the Lord, to do righteousness and justice” (Genesis 18:19).

### Part 6
With regard to the term <b>“the Lord,” this</b> alludes to <b>blessing the name</b> of God; <b>and so it states</b> in another verse: <b>“And he who blasphemes the name of the Lord…shall be put to death”</b> (Leviticus 24:16). <b>“God,” this</b> alludes to <b>idol worship; and so it states: “You shall have no other gods</b> before Me” (Exodus 20:2). <b>“The man,” this</b> alludes to <b>bloodshed; and so it states: “One who sheds the blood of man,</b> by man his blood shall be shed” (Genesis 9:6).

### Part 7
With regard to the term <b>“saying,” this</b> alludes to <b>forbidden sexual relations; and so it states: “Saying, if a man sends his wife, and she goes from him and becomes another man’s…</b>will that land not be greatly polluted? But you have played the harlot with many lovers” (Jeremiah 3:1). <b>“Of every tree of the garden”</b> alludes to the fact that one may partake only of items that are permitted to him, as they belong to him, <b>and</b> he may <b>not</b> partake of <b>stolen items. “You may freely eat”</b> alludes to the fact that one may eat fruit, <b>but not a limb from a living</b> animal.

### Part 8
<b>When Rav Yitzḥak came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he taught</b> two of the expositions in <b>the opposite</b> order: <b>“And…commanded,” this</b> alludes to <b>idol worship. “God,” this</b> alludes to courts of <b>judgment.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> the source for the exposition: <b>“God [<i>Elohim</i>],” this</b> alludes to courts of <b>judgment,</b> is clear; <b>as it is written: “Then the master of the house shall come near the judges [<i>ha’elohim</i>]”</b> (Exodus 22:7). Evidently, judges are called <i>elohim</i>. <b>But</b> with regard to the exposition: <b>“And…commanded,” this</b> alludes to <b>idol worship, from where</b> is this <b>inferred?</b>

### Part 10
<b>Rav Ḥisda and Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi</b> both give answers to this question. <b>One</b> of them <b>says</b> that it is inferred from the verse: <b>“They have turned aside quickly out of the way that I commanded them; they have made them</b> a molten calf” (Exodus 32:8). The word “commanded” is mentioned here in the context of idol worship. <b>And</b> the other <b>one says</b> that it is inferred from the verse: <b>“Ephraim is oppressed, crushed in justice, because he willingly went after filth [<i>tzav</i>]”</b> (Hosea 5:11). The word <i>tzav</i>, used in this context in reference to idol worship, is the same Hebrew word used in the phrase: “And…commanded [<i>vaytzav</i>].”

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the difference <b>between</b> these two sources? The Gemara answers: The practical difference <b>between</b> them is in the case of <b>a gentile who fashioned an idol but did not bow to it,</b> i.e., he has not yet worshipped it. <b>According to the one who says</b> that the proof is from the verse: <b>“They have made</b> them a molten calf,” <b>he is rendered liable from the time of fashioning</b> it. <b>According to the one who says</b> that the proof is from the verse: <b>“Because he willingly went</b> after filth,” he is not liable <b>until he goes after it and worships it.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Rava says: And is there anyone who says</b> that <b>a gentile who fashioned an idol but did not bow to it is liable? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>With regard to idol worship, matters,</b> i.e., transgressions, <b>for which a Jewish court executes</b> a Jew who commits one of them, <b>are prohibited to a descendant of Noah.</b> But with regard to transgressions <b>for which a Jewish court does not execute</b> a Jew who commits one of them, <b>a descendant of Noah is not prohibited from</b> doing <b>them. To exclude what</b> transgressions, i.e., to determine that they do not apply to gentiles, is this stated? Is it <b>not to exclude</b> the case of <b>a gentile who fashioned an idol but did not bow to it?</b> Since Jews are not executed for this transgression, gentiles should not be liable for this act either.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Pappa says: No,</b> it is possible that it is stated <b>to exclude embracing and kissing</b> the idol; neither a Jew nor a gentile who embraces or kisses an idol is liable. No proof can be brought from here with regard to a gentile who fashions an idol but does not worship it.

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>Embracing and kissing</b> an idol <b>in what</b> manner? <b>If we say</b> that he did so <b>in its</b> standard <b>manner</b> of worship, i.e., that embracing and kissing is the standard method of worshipping this idol, certainly <b>he is liable to</b> receive the <b>death</b> penalty. <b>Rather,</b> it is stated <b>to exclude</b> a case <b>where</b> he did <b>not</b> do so <b>in its</b> standard <b>manner</b> of worship.

### Part 15
§ The Gemara asks with regard to the list of the Noahide mitzvot: <b>Were the descendants of Noah commanded</b> to establish courts of <b>judgment? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Jewish people were commanded</b> to observe <b>ten mitzvot</b> when they were <b>in Marah: Seven that the descendants of Noah accepted upon themselves, and</b> God <b>added to them</b> the following mitzvot: <b>Judgment, and Shabbat, and honoring</b> one’s <b>father and mother.</b>

### Part 16
The mitzva of <b>judgment</b> was given at Marah, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to Marah: <b>“There He made for them a statute and an ordinance”</b> (Exodus 15:25). <b>Shabbat and honoring</b> one’s <b>father and mother</b> were given at Marah, <b>as it is written</b> concerning them in the Ten Commandments: “Observe the day of Shabbat to keep it holy, <b>as the Lord your God commanded you”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:11), and similarly: “Honor your father and your mother, as the Lord your God commanded you” (Deuteronomy 5:16). The phrase “as the Lord your God commanded you” indicates that they had already been commanded to observe these mitzvot previously. <b>And Rav Yehuda says: “As</b> the Lord your God <b>commanded you” in Marah.</b> Apparently, the mitzva of establishing courts is not included in the seven Noahide mitzvot.

### Part 17
<b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says:</b> Establishing courts is a Noahide mitzva. The additional mitzva that was given in Marah <b>was necessary only with regard to</b> the details of the <i>halakhot</i> of the justice system, e.g., that a defendant in a capital case is punished only by a full panel of twenty-three judges of the <b>Sanhedrin, and</b> only if there are two <b>witnesses</b> who testify concerning him, <b>and</b> only if he was issued <b>a forewarning</b> before his transgression.

### Part 18
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> and the mitzva given at Marah is a specification of the <i>halakhot</i> of the justice system, <b>what</b> is the meaning of the sentence: <b>And</b> God <b>added to them: Judgment?</b> The details of a preexisting mitzva would not be referred to as an added mitzva.

### Part 19
<b>Rather, Rava says:</b> The mitzva given at Marah <b>was necessary only with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of fines.</b> Since these are not <i>halakhot</i> that pertain to the basic performance of justice, but rather concern an additional fine for the guilty party, they were not given to the descendants of Noah. The Gemara asks: According to this interpretation, the language of the <i>baraita</i> is <b>still</b> inaccurate, as <b>it should have</b> stated: <b>And</b> God <b>added to them</b> more <i>halakhot</i> <b>of judgment.</b>

### Part 20
<b>Rather, Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov says: It was necessary only</b> for the additional requirement <b>to establish a court in each and every province and in each and every city.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And were the descendants of Noah not commanded</b> with regard to <b>this</b> matter? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Just as the Jewish people were commanded to establish courts in each and every province and in each and every city, so too, the descendants of Noah were commanded to establish courts in each and every province and in each and every city?</b>

### Part 21
<b>Rather, Rava says: This <i>tanna</i>,</b> who holds that the mitzva of establishing courts of judgment is not included in the Noahide mitzvot, <b>is</b> the <b><i>tanna</i> of the school of Menashe, who removes</b> from the list of the Noahide mitzvot two mitzvot whose mnemonic is <b><i>dalet</i>, <i>kaf</i>,</b> which stands for judgment [<i>dinim</i>] and blessing the name of God [<i>birkat Hashem</i>], <b>and inserts</b> in their place two mitzvot whose mnemonic is <b><i>samekh</i>, <i>kaf</i>,</b> standing for castration [<i>seirus</i>] and diverse kinds [<i>kilayim</i>].

### Part 22
<b>As the school of Menashe taught: The descendants of Noah were commanded</b> to observe <b>seven mitzvot:</b> The prohibitions of <b>idol worship, and forbidden sexual relations, and blood-shed,</b> and <b>robbery, and</b> eating <b>a limb from a living</b> animal, and <b>castration, and diverse kinds.</b>

### Part 23
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Adam, the first</b> man, <b>was commanded only with regard to</b> the prohibition of <b>idol worship, as it is stated: “And the Lord God commanded the man”</b> (Genesis 2:16). <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says:</b> He was <b>also</b> commanded <b>concerning blessing the name</b> of God. <b>And some say</b> that he was <b>also</b> commanded <b>concerning</b> establishing courts of <b>judgment.</b>

### Part 24
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says,</b> in interpretation of the aforementioned verse: Since <b>I am “God,” do not curse Me;</b> since <b>I am “God,” do not exchange Me</b> with another god; since <b>I am “God,” My fear shall be upon you?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion? It is <b>in accordance with</b> what <b>some say,</b> i.e., that the phrase “and the Lord God commanded the man” includes the prohibitions against cursing God’s name and idol worship, as well as the mitzva of establishing a system of law and justice, so that the fear of God will be upon the people.

### Part 25
The Gemara challenges: <b>If</b> the <b><i>tanna</i> of the school of Menashe interprets</b> the verse <b>“and</b> the Lord God <b>commanded” homiletically, even these</b> mitzvot, cursing the name of God and establishing courts, should be included. And <b>if he does not interpret</b> the verse <b>“and</b> the Lord God <b>commanded” homiletically, from where does he</b> derive <b>these</b> seven mitzvot in his list?

### Part 26
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually, he does not interpret</b> the verse <b>“and</b> the Lord God <b>commanded” homiletically,</b> but with regard to <b>these</b> mitzvot in his list, <b>each and every one</b> of them <b>is written separately</b> in the Torah. The prohibitions of <b>idol worship and forbidden sexual relations</b> are stated,
