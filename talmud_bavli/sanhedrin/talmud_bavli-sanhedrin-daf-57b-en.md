### Part 1
he <b>is executed for</b> killing <b>him</b> even though he acted in self-defense, and a descendant of Noah is also killed for this.

### Part 2
§ <b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Aḥa found that it was written in a book of <i>Aggadot</i> in the study hall of Rav:</b> Contrary to the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a Jew, <b>a descendant of Noah is executed on the basis of</b> the verdict of even <b>one judge, and by</b> the testimony of even <b>one witness,</b> and <b>without</b> being given <b>forewarning</b> before committing the transgression. He can be judged or testified against only <b>by the mouth of a man and not by the mouth of a woman; but even a relative</b> may judge his case or testify against him. The Sages <b>said in the name of Rabbi Yishmael</b> that a descendant of Noah is executed <b>even for</b> killing <b>fetuses.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> They are derived from that <b>which the verse states:</b> “And <b>your blood of your lives I will require;</b> at the hand of every animal I will require it; and at the hand of man, even at the hand of every man’s brother, I will require the life of man” (Genesis 9:5). It is derived from the term “I will require,” which is stated in the singular, that a descendant of Noah is executed <b>on the basis</b> of the verdict of <b>even one judge.</b>

### Part 4
It is derived from the phrase <b>“at the hand of every animal”</b> that one is executed <b>even without forewarning,</b> as an animal certainly cannot forewarn someone. It is derived from the phrase <b>“I will require it; and at the hand of man,”</b> with “I” stated in the singular, that the sentence is issued <b>on the basis</b> of the testimony of <b>even one witness.</b> It is derived from the phrase <b>“at the hand of every man,”</b> that the judgment and testimony must be at the hand of a man, <b>but not at the hand of a woman.</b> It is derived from the term <b>“his brother”</b> that the testimony of the witness is accepted <b>even</b> if he is <b>a relative</b> of the defendant.

### Part 5
It is stated in that book of <i>Aggadot</i> that the Sages <b>said in the name of Rabbi Yishmael:</b> A descendant of Noah is executed <b>even for</b> killing <b>fetuses.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yishmael?</b> The Gemara answers: It is derived from that <b>which is written: “One who sheds the blood of a person, by a person [<i>ba’adam</i>] his blood shall be shed”</b> (Genesis 9:6). The word <i>ba’adam</i> literally means: In a person, and is interpreted homiletically: <b>What is a person that is in a person? You must say: This is a fetus that is in its mother’s womb.</b> Accordingly, a descendant of Noah is liable for killing a fetus.

### Part 6
The Gemara comments: <b>And the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> who does not derive the <i>halakha</i> concerning fetuses, <b>is the <i>tanna</i> of the school of Menashe, who says</b> that <b>all death</b> penalties <b>stated with regard to the descendants of Noah are</b> referring to <b>nothing other than strangulation. And</b> he interprets this verse as follows: <b>Cast,</b> i.e., redirect, <b>this</b> term: <b>“In a person,”</b> and explain it <b>with regard to the latter</b> part <b>of the verse, and interpret it homiletically like this: “In a person, his blood shall be shed.”</b> In <b>what</b> manner <b>is a person’s blood shed while it is in</b> the <b>person’s body,</b> without external bleeding? <b>You must say</b> that <b>this is strangulation.</b> It is therefore derived that the execution of a descendant of Noah is by strangulation.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Hamnuna raises an objection</b> to the statement in the book of <i>Aggadot</i> that a descendant of Noah can be judged or testified against only by a man and not by a woman: <b>And is a woman</b> who is a descendant of Noah <b>not commanded</b> to establish courts of judgment? <b>But isn’t it written</b> with regard to Abraham, who at that point had the status of a descendant of Noah: <b>“For I have known him, to the end that he may command</b> his sons and his household after him, that they may keep the way of the Lord, to do righteousness and justice” (Genesis 18:19). The word “household” is referring to the women, indicating that they are also commanded to execute justice.

### Part 8
<b>He raises the objection and he resolves it:</b> Abraham commanded <b>his sons to</b> carry out <b>justice,</b> whereas <b>his household,</b> the women in his family, he commanded <b>to</b> give <b>charity;</b> the Hebrew word for righteousness [<i>tzedek</i>] can also mean charity [<i>tzedaka</i>].

### Part 9
<b>Rav Avya the Elder said to Rav Pappa:</b> Why not <b>say</b> that <b>a female descendant of Noah who killed</b> someone <b>should not be executed;</b> as <b>it is written: “At the hand of every man,” and not “at the hand of every woman”?</b> Rav Pappa <b>said to him: This</b> is what <b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> It is derived from the phrase <b>“one who sheds the blood of a person”</b> that one who murders is liable to be executed <b>in any case,</b> whether that person is male or female.

### Part 10
Rav Avya asked further: Why not <b>say</b> that <b>a female descendant of Noah who committed adultery should not be executed, as it is written: “Therefore a man shall leave</b> his father and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they shall be one flesh” (Genesis 2:24); a man, <b>but not a woman?</b> Rav Pappa <b>said to him: This</b> is what <b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> At the end of the verse it states: <b>“And they shall be one flesh.” The verse then combines</b> men and women, indicating that the same <i>halakha</i> applies to both.

### Part 11
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “No one [<i>ish ish</i>] shall approach any that is kin to him, to uncover their nakedness” (Leviticus 18:6): The verse could have stated: <b>One [<i>ish</i>]</b> shall not approach. <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state “no one”?</b> It is <b>to include the gentiles, who are prohibited from</b> engaging in <b>forbidden sexual relations, as Jews</b> are.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>But is it derived from here? It is derived from there,</b> from the verse that was already interpreted as teaching this <i>halakha</i>: “And the Lord God commanded the man, <b>saying”</b> (Genesis 2:16), <b>this</b> alludes to <b>forbidden sexual relations</b> (see 56b).

### Part 13
The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> the verse is referring <b>to their</b> women, gentiles, <b>with whom relations are forbidden. And here</b> it is referring <b>to our</b> women, Jews, <b>with whom relations are forbidden.</b> In other words, a gentile who engages in intercourse with a married Jewish woman is liable. <b>As it is taught in the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: If a gentile <b>engages in intercourse with those Jewish</b> women <b>with whom relations are forbidden,</b> i.e., a married Jewish woman, <b>he is judged according to the <i>halakhot</i> of the Jews.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> is this gentile judged according to the <i>halakhot</i> of the Jews? <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says:</b> The statement of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is necessary only</b> to teach these <i>halakhot</i>: That he must be judged <b>by a Sanhedrin, and</b> that he is punished only if two <b>witnesses</b> testify concerning him, <b>and</b> only if he was issued <b>a forewarning</b> before his transgression.

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: Should the <i>halakha</i> of a gentile who engaged in intercourse with a forbidden Jewish woman be <b>less</b> stringent than that of a gentile who engaged in intercourse with a forbidden gentile woman, in which case these conditions do not apply?

### Part 16
<b>Rather, Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The statement of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is necessary only to</b> teach the <i>halakha</i> in the case of a gentile who engages in intercourse with <b>a betrothed young</b> Jewish <b>woman, which</b> does <b>not</b> apply <b>to</b> gentiles. By <i>halakha</i>, only marriage applies to gentiles, not betrothal. Therefore, <b>we judge them according to our <i>halakha</i></b> in that case.

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to gentiles who engage in intercourse with <b>a married</b> Jewish <b>woman, do we judge them according to their <i>halakha</i>? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a gentile <b>engages in intercourse with a betrothed young</b> Jewish <b>woman, he is punished by stoning;</b> if he engages in intercourse <b>with a married</b> Jewish <b>woman he is punished by strangulation?</b> The Gemara explains its question: <b>And if</b> they are judged <b>according to their <i>halakha</i>,</b> he would <b>be</b> executed by the <b>sword.</b>

### Part 18
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>A married woman, which</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches?</b> It is referring to a case <b>where</b> the woman <b>had entered the wedding canopy but had not</b> yet <b>engaged in intercourse</b> with her husband, in which case she is considered married according to the <i>halakhot</i> that apply to Jews but not according to the <i>halakhot</i> that apply to gentiles. <b>Since with regard to</b> gentiles, marriage has <b>not</b> yet taken effect, <b>we judge them according to our <i>halakhot</i>.</b> Therefore, a gentile who engages in intercourse with such a Jewish woman is executed by strangulation.

### Part 19
<b>As Rabbi Ḥanina teaches:</b> Gentiles can <b>have</b> the status of a married woman <b>who has engaged in intercourse with her husband,</b> i.e., such a woman is considered married according to their laws, but <b>they cannot have</b> the status of a married woman <b>who has entered the wedding canopy but has not engaged in intercourse</b> with her husband.

### Part 20
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Any forbidden sexual relations for which a Jewish court administers capital punishment are prohibited to a descendant of Noah,</b> and any forbidden sexual relations <b>for which a Jewish court does not administer capital punishment are not prohibited to a descendant of Noah;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: There are many</b> types of <b>forbidden sexual relations for which a Jewish court does not administer capital punishment and are</b> nevertheless <b>prohibited to a descendant of Noah.</b>

### Part 21
If a gentile <b>engages in intercourse with those Jews with whom relations are forbidden, he is judged according to the <i>halakhot</i> of the Jews.</b> If he <b>engages in intercourse with those descendants of Noah with whom relations are forbidden, he is judged according to the <i>halakhot</i> of the descendants of Noah. And we have only</b> the case of <b>a betrothed young woman</b> as a case where a gentile is judged according to the <i>halakhot</i> of the Jews, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan.

### Part 22
The Gemara suggests: <b>And let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>also count</b> the case of a woman who <b>had entered the wedding canopy but had not</b> yet <b>engaged in intercourse</b> with her husband. The Gemara explains: <b>This <i>tanna</i> is the <i>tanna</i> of the school of Menashe, who says</b> that <b>all death</b> penalties <b>stated with regard to the descendants of Noah are</b> referring to <b>nothing other than strangulation,</b> and since the punishment in Jewish <i>halakha</i> for engaging in intercourse with a married woman is also strangulation, both <b>this</b> punishment <b>and that</b> punishment are <b>strangulation;</b> there is no difference between the <i>halakha</i> for Jews and the <i>halakha</i> for gentiles in such a case.

### Part 23
With regard to the opinion of Rabbi Meir stated in the first clause of the <i>baraita</i>, the Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Meir hold</b> that <b>any forbidden sexual relations for which a Jewish court administers capital punishment is prohibited to a descendant of Noah? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a convert</b>
