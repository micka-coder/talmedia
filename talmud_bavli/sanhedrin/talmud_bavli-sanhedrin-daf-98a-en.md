### Part 1
<b>Kings shall see and arise, princes shall prostrate themselves,</b> because of the Lord, Who is faithful, and the Holy One of Israel, Who has chosen you” (Isaiah 49:7), indicating that redemption will come independent of repentance?

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Eliezer said to him: But isn’t it already stated: “If you will return, Israel, says the Lord, return to Me”</b> (Jeremiah 4:1), indicating that redemption is contingent upon repentance? <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to him: But isn’t it already stated: “And I heard the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, when he lifted up his right hand and his left hand to heaven and swore by the One Who lives forever that it shall be for a period, periods, and a half; when the crushing of the power of the holy people shall have been completed, all these</b> things shall be finished” (Daniel 12:7), indicating that the time for redemption is set and unrelated to repentance? <b>And Rabbi Eliezer was silent,</b> unable to refute the proof from that verse.

### Part 3
§ <b>And Rabbi Abba says: You have no</b> more <b>explicit</b> manifestation of the <b>end</b> of days <b>than this</b> following phenomenon, <b>as it is stated: “But you, mountains of Israel, you shall give your branches, and yield your fruit to My people of Israel,</b> for they will soon be coming” (Ezekiel 36:8). When produce will grow in abundance in Eretz Yisrael, it is an indication that the Messiah will be coming soon. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> You have no greater manifestation of the end of days <b>than this</b> following phenomenon <b>as well, as it is stated: “For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; nor was there peace from the oppressor to him who exits and to him who enters”</b> (Zechariah 8:10). When there are no wages for work and no rent paid for use of one’s animal, that is an indication that the coming of the Messiah is at hand.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>“Nor was there peace from the oppressor to him who exits and to him who enters”? Rav says:</b> It means that <b>even</b> for <b>Torah scholars, with regard to whom</b> the promise of <b>peace is written, as it is written: “Great peace have they who love Your Torah;</b> and there is no obstacle for them” (Psalms 119:165), <b>there will be no peace from the oppressor. And Shmuel says:</b> It means that the Messiah will not come <b>until all the prices are equal.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina says: The son of David will not come until a fish will be sought for an ill person and will not be found, as it is stated</b> with regard to the downfall of Egypt: <b>“Then I will make their waters clear and cause their rivers to run like oil”</b> (Ezekiel 32:14), meaning that the current in the rivers will come to a virtual standstill. <b>And it is written thereafter: “On that day I will cause the glory of the house of Israel to flourish”</b> (Ezekiel 29:21).

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina says: The son of David will not come until the contemptuous [<i>hazalla</i>] kingdom</b> of Rome <b>will cease from the Jewish people, as it is stated: “And He shall sever the sprigs [<i>hazalzallim</i>] with pruning hooks”</b> (Isaiah 18:5). <b>And it is written thereafter: “At that time shall a present be brought to the Lord of hosts, by a people scattered and hairless”</b> (Isaiah 18:7).

### Part 7
<b>Ze’eiri says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says: The son of David will not come until the arrogant will cease</b> to exist <b>from</b> among <b>the Jewish people, as it is stated: “For then I will remove from your midst your proudly exulting ones”</b> (Zephaniah 3:11), <b>and it is written</b> afterward: <b>“And I will leave in your midst a poor and lowly people, and they shall take refuge in the name of the Lord”</b> (Zephaniah 3:12).

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Simlai says in the name of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon: The son of David will not come until all the judges and officers will cease</b> to exist <b>from</b> among <b>the Jewish people,</b> and there will be no more autonomous government in Eretz Yisrael, <b>as it is stated: “And I will turn My hand against you and purge away your dross as with lye</b> and take away your base alloy. <b>And I will restore your judges</b> as at the first” (Isaiah 1:25–26).

### Part 9
<b>Ulla says: Jerusalem is redeemed only by means of righteousness, as it is stated: “Zion shall be redeemed with justice and those who return to it with righteousness”</b> (Isaiah 1:27). <b>Rav Pappa says: If the arrogant will cease</b> to exist, <b>the</b> Persian <b>sorcerers will cease</b> to exist as well. <b>If the</b> deceitful <b>judges</b> will <b>cease</b> to exist, <b>the royal officers [<i>gazirpatei</i>]</b> and taskmasters <b>will cease</b> to exist. Rav Pappa elaborates: <b>If the arrogant will cease, the</b> Persian <b>sorcerers will cease, as it is written: “And I will purge away your dross [<i>sigayikh</i>] as with lye, and I will remove all your alloy [<i>bedilayikh</i>].”</b> When the arrogant [<i>sigim</i>] are purged, the sorcerers, who are separated [<i>muvdalim</i>] from the fear of God, will also cease. <b>And if the</b> deceitful <b>judges cease</b> to exist, <b>the royal officers</b> and taskmasters <b>will cease</b> to exist, <b>as it is written: “The Lord has removed your judgments; cast out your enemy”</b> (Zephaniah 3:15).

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: If you saw a generation whose</b> wisdom and Torah study <b>is steadily diminishing, await</b> the coming of the Messiah, <b>as it is stated: “And the afflicted people You will redeem”</b> (II Samuel 22:28). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: If you saw a generation</b> whose <b>troubles inundate it like a river, await</b> the coming of the Messiah, <b>as it is stated: “When distress will come like a river that the breath of the Lord drives”</b> (Isaiah 59:19). <b>And juxtaposed to it</b> is the verse: <b>“And a redeemer will come to Zion”</b> (Isaiah 59:20).

### Part 11
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The son of David will come only in a generation that is entirely innocent,</b> in which case they will be deserving of redemption, <b>or</b> in a generation that is <b>entirely guilty,</b> in which case there will be no alternative to redemption. He may come <b>in a generation that is entirely innocent, as it is written: “And your people also shall be all righteous; they shall inherit the land forever”</b> (Isaiah 60:21). He may come <b>in a generation that is entirely guilty, as it is written: “And He saw that there was no man, and was astonished that there was no intercessor;</b> therefore His arm brought salvation to Him, and His righteousness, it sustained Him” (Isaiah 59:16). <b>And it is written:</b> “For My own sake, <b>for My own sake will I do it;</b> for how should it be profaned? And My glory I will not give it to another” (Isaiah 48:11).

### Part 12
§ <b>Rabbi Alexandri says: Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi raises a contradiction</b> in a verse addressing God’s commitment to redeem the Jewish people. In the verse: “I the Lord in its time I will hasten it” (Isaiah 60:22), <b>it is written: “In its time,”</b> indicating that there is a designated time for the redemption, <b>and it is written: “I will hasten it,”</b> indicating that there is no set time for the redemption. Rabbi Alexandri explains: <b>If they merit</b> redemption through repentance and good deeds <b>I will hasten</b> the coming of the Messiah. <b>If they do not merit</b> redemption, the coming of the Messiah will be <b>in its</b> designated <b>time.</b>

### Part 13
<b>Rabbi Alexandri says: Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi raises a contradiction</b> between two depictions of the coming of the Messiah. <b>It is written: “There came with the clouds of heaven, one like unto a son of man…</b>and there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom…his dominion is an everlasting dominion” (Daniel 7:13–14). <b>And it is written:</b> “Behold, your king will come to you; he is just and victorious; <b>lowly and riding upon a donkey</b> and upon a colt, the foal of a donkey” (Zechariah 9:9). Rabbi Alexandri explains: <b>If</b> the Jewish people <b>merit</b> redemption, the Messiah will come in a miraculous manner <b>with the clouds of heaven. If they do not merit</b> redemption, the Messiah will come <b>lowly and riding upon a donkey.</b>

### Part 14
<b>King Shapur</b> of Persia <b>said to Shmuel</b> mockingly: <b>You say</b> that the <b>Messiah</b> will <b>come on a donkey; I will send him the riding [<i>barka</i>] horse that I have.</b> Shmuel <b>said to him: Do you have</b> a horse <b>with one thousand colors [<i>bar ḥivar gavanei</i>]</b> like the donkey of the Messiah? Certainly his donkey will be miraculous.

### Part 15
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi found Elijah</b> the prophet, <b>who was standing at the entrance of the</b> burial <b>cave of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>said to him: Will I</b> be privileged to <b>come to the World-to-Come?</b> Elijah <b>said to him: If this Master,</b> the Holy One, Blessed be He, <b>will wish</b> it so. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: Two I saw,</b> Elijah and me, <b>and the voice of three I heard,</b> as the Divine Presence was also there, and it was in reference to Him that Elijah said: If this Master will wish it so.

### Part 16
Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>said to</b> Elijah: <b>When</b> will the <b>Messiah come?</b> Elijah <b>said to him: Go ask him.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi asked: <b>And where is he sitting?</b> Elijah said to him: <b>At the entrance of</b> the city of <b>Rome.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi asked him: <b>And what is his</b> identifying <b>sign</b> by means of which I can recognize him? Elijah answered: <b>He sits among the poor who suffer from illnesses. And all of them untie</b> their bandages <b>and tie</b> them all <b>at once,</b> but the Messiah <b>unties one</b> bandage <b>and ties one</b> at a time. <b>He says: Perhaps I will be needed</b> to serve to bring about the redemption. Therefore, I will never tie more than one bandage, so <b>that I will not be delayed.</b>

### Part 17
Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>went to</b> the Messiah. <b>He said to</b> the Messiah: <b>Greetings to you, my rabbi and my teacher.</b> The Messiah <b>said to him: Greetings to you, bar Leva’i.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>said to him: When will the Master come?</b> The Messiah <b>said to him: Today.</b> Sometime later, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>came to Elijah.</b> Elijah <b>said to him: What did</b> the Messiah <b>say to you? He said to</b> Elijah that the Messiah said: <b>Greetings [<i>shalom</i>] to you, bar Leva’i.</b> Elijah <b>said to him:</b> He thereby <b>guaranteed</b> that <b>you and your father</b> will enter <b>the World-to-Come,</b> as he greeted you with <i>shalom</i>. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>said to</b> Elijah: The Messiah <b>lied to me, as he said to me: I am coming today, and he did not come.</b> Elijah <b>said to him</b> that <b>this</b> is what <b>he said to you:</b> He said that he will come <b>“today, if you will listen to his voice”</b> (Psalms 95:7).

### Part 18
§ <b>Rabbi Yosei ben Kisma’s students asked him: When will the son of David come?</b> Rabbi Yosei ben Kisma <b>said: I am hesitant</b> to answer you, <b>lest you request from me a sign</b> to corroborate my statement. <b>They said to him: We are not asking you for a sign.</b>

### Part 19
Rabbi Yosei ben Kisma <b>said to them:</b> You will see <b>when this</b> existing <b>gate</b> of Rome <b>falls and will be rebuilt, and will fall</b> a second time <b>and will be rebuilt, and will fall</b> a third time. <b>And they will not manage to rebuild it until the son of David comes.</b> The students <b>said to him: Our rabbi, give us a sign.</b> Rabbi Yosei ben Kisma <b>said to them: But didn’t you say to me that you are not asking me for a sign?</b>

### Part 20
<b>They said to him: And nevertheless,</b> provide us with a sign. Rabbi Yosei ben Kisma <b>said to them: If it is</b> as I say, <b>the water of the Cave of Pamyas will be transformed into blood.</b> The Gemara relates: <b>And</b> it <b>was transformed into blood.</b>

### Part 21
<b>At the time of his death,</b> Rabbi Yosei ben Kisma <b>said to</b> his students: <b>Place my coffin deep</b> in the ground,
