<b>the handle of a spear [<i>devortiya</i>].</b>

### Part 2
Rav Abba bar Ya’akov <b>said to</b> bar Ḥama: Why did you bring these witnesses? <b>What do you hold?</b> Do you hold <b>like Rabbi Meir,</b> that one who is guilty of a monetary transgression is disqualified from bearing witness in capital cases too? But in a dispute between <b>Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yosei, the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, and doesn’t Rabbi Yosei say</b> that if one <b>was rendered a conspiring witness in</b> a case of <b>monetary law he is fit to</b> testify in cases of <b>capital law?</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rav Pappi</b> immediately <b>said to him: This statement</b> applies only <b>where</b> the <b><i>tanna</i> did not teach us an unattributed</b> mishna <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir. Here, the <i>tanna</i> taught us an unattributed</b> mishna <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>From what</b> mishna is it seen that the <i>tanna</i> taught an unattributed mishna in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>from that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Nidda</i> 49b): <b>Anyone who is fit to adjudicate</b> cases of <b>capital law is fit to adjudicate</b> cases of <b>monetary law,</b> that is inconclusive. Even though one can compare the <i>halakhot</i> of disqualifying judges to the <i>halakhot</i> of disqualifying witnesses, one cannot cite this as an example of a mishna taught in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir. <b>Whose</b> opinion is recorded in this mishna? <b>If we say it is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, isn’t there</b> the counterexample of <b>a conspiring witness in monetary matters, who is fit to</b> adjudicate cases of <b>capital law but is disqualified from</b> adjudicating cases of <b>monetary law? Rather, is</b> the ruling of the mishna <b>not</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir?</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara explains why this cannot be the source: If this is the unattributed mishna Rav Pappi was referring to, <b>from where</b> is it derived that it is the opinion of Rabbi Meir? <b>Perhaps</b> the mishna is <b>referring to</b> those who are <b>disqualified</b> from serving as judges due to their <b>lineage,</b> e.g., converts and <i>mamzerim</i>, not those who are disqualified due to sin.

### Part 6
<b>As, if you do not say so,</b> then with regard to <b>the latter clause</b> of that mishna, <b>which teaches: There is</b> one who is <b>fit to adjudicate</b> cases of <b>monetary law but is unfit to adjudicate</b> cases of <b>capital law,</b> to whom could this be referring? <b>Why</b> would one be <b>unfit</b> to adjudicate cases of capital law? If it is referring to one <b>who was rendered a conspiring witness in</b> a case of <b>capital law,</b> is he <b>fit to adjudicate</b> cases of <b>monetary law? But doesn’t everyone agree</b> that <b>he is disqualified? Rather,</b> the mishna is clearly <b>referring to</b> those who are <b>disqualified</b> from serving as judges due to their <b>lineage. Here too,</b> in the first clause, the mishna is <b>referring to</b> those who are <b>disqualified</b> from serving as judges due to their <b>lineage.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rather, the <i>tanna</i> taught us an unattributed</b> mishna <b>here, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Rosh HaShana</i> 22a): <b>These</b> people <b>are disqualified</b> from bearing witness, as they are considered wicked and guilty of monetary transgressions: <b>One who plays with dice, and those who lend</b> money <b>with interest, and those who fly pigeons, and merchants</b> who trade in produce of the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year. <b>And</b> Canaanite <b>slaves</b> are also disqualified. <b>This is the principle:</b> For <b>any testimony for which a woman is not fit, these too are not fit.</b> Although in certain cases a woman’s testimony is accepted, e.g., testimony concerning the death of someone’s husband, in most cases her testimony is not valid.

### Part 8
In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is this mishna? <b>If we say</b> it is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> that is difficult: <b>But isn’t there testimony in</b> cases of <b>capital law, for which a woman is not fit but for which</b> those considered wicked due to having committed monetary transgressions <b>are fit? Rather, is it not</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who maintains these people are disqualified from testifying in cases of capital law as well? Apparently, this unspecified mishna follows the opinion of Rabbi Meir. Therefore, the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with his opinion.

### Part 9
Based on this conclusion, one of the witnesses who testified against bar Ḥama with regard to the murder was disqualified, and bar Ḥama was acquitted. <b>Bar Ḥama</b> then <b>arose and kissed</b> Rabbi Pappi <b>on his feet and accepted</b> upon himself <b>to</b> pay <b>his tax [<i>karga</i>] for all of his years.</b>

### Part 10
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>And these are</b> the ones disqualified from bearing witness or from serving as judges due to their status as <b>relatives</b> of one of the litigants or of each other: One’s <b>brother, and his paternal uncle, and his maternal uncle, and his sister’s husband, and the husband of his paternal aunt, and the husband of his maternal aunt, and his mother’s husband, and his father-in-law, and his brother-in-law,</b> i.e., the husband of his wife’s sister. <b>They</b> themselves, all of these people, <b>and</b> also <b>their sons, and their sons-in-law</b> are considered relatives. <b>And his stepson alone</b> is disqualified, but not his stepson’s sons or sons-in-law.

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Yosei says: This</b> aforementioned <i>halakha</i> <b>is Rabbi Akiva’s</b> version of the <b>mishna. But the initial</b> version of the <b>mishna</b> reads as follows: <b>His uncle and the son of his uncle, and anyone who is fit to inherit</b> from <b>him.</b> Only paternal relatives, who are fit to inherit from him, are disqualified; maternal relatives, who do not inherit from him, are not disqualified from bearing witness about him or from adjudicating his case. <b>And</b> the <i>halakha</i> disqualifying a relative from bearing witness or serving as a judge is referring to <b>anyone who is related to him at the time</b> of the trial.

### Part 12
If one <b>was</b> once <b>a relative and became unrelated</b> by the time of the trial, e.g., he married the daughter of one of the litigants, but she died or they were divorced, in this case <b>he is fit. Rabbi Yehuda says: Even if his daughter died but</b> her husband, the former son-in-law, <b>has children from her, he is</b> still considered <b>a relative;</b> the children cause them to remain related.

### Part 13
<b>One who loves or one who hates</b> one of the litigants is also disqualified. With regard to one who <b>loves</b> one of the litigants, <b>this</b> is referring to <b>his groomsman.</b> One who <b>hates</b> is referring to <b>anyone who, out of enmity, did not speak with</b> the litigant for <b>three days.</b> The Rabbis <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda: <b>The Jewish people are not suspected of</b> bearing false witness due to love or hate.

### Part 14
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>From where is this matter,</b> that relatives are disqualified from bearing witness, derived? The Gemara answers: It is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“The fathers shall not be put to death for the children,</b> neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers; every man shall be put to death for his own sin” (Deuteronomy 24:16). <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> this first clause? <b>If</b> it is <b>to teach that the fathers shall not be put to death for the sin of the children, nor</b> shall <b>the children</b> be put to death <b>for the sin of the fathers,</b> this is unnecessary, as <b>it is in any event stated: “Every man shall be put to death for his own sin.”</b>

### Part 15
<b>Rather,</b> the statement <b>“The fathers shall not be put to death for the children”</b> should be interpreted to mean that they shall not be put to death <b>by the testimony of the children,</b> and the statement <b>“Neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers”</b> should be interpreted to mean that they shall not be put to death <b>by the testimony of the fathers.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>And are children not</b> put to death <b>for the sin of the fathers? But isn’t it written: “Visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children,</b> and upon the children’s children, unto the third and unto the fourth generation” (Exodus 34:7)?

### Part 17
The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> the verse is referring to a situation <b>where</b> the children <b>adopt the actions of their ancestors as their own.</b> If they do not behave like their ancestors they are not punished for their ancestors’ sins.

### Part 18
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse: <b>“And also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them”</b> (Leviticus 26:39), is referring to a case <b>where they adopt the actions of their ancestors as their own.</b> Do <b>you say</b> that it is referring specifically to a case <b>where they adopt</b> the actions of their ancestors, <b>or</b> perhaps it applies even <b>where they do not adopt</b> their ancestors’ actions? <b>When</b> the verse <b>states: “Every man shall be put to death for his own sin,”</b> the Torah explicates that one is not put to death if he did not sin. Therefore, the verse in Leviticus is clearly referring to a case <b>where they adopt the actions of their ancestors as their own.</b>

### Part 19
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> are descendants <b>not</b> punished for the sins of their ancestors unless they adopt their behavior? <b>But isn’t it written: “And they shall stumble one upon another”</b> (Leviticus 26:37)? This verse is homiletically interpreted to mean that the Jewish people shall stumble, <b>one due to the iniquity of another,</b> i.e., they are punished for each other’s sins, which <b>teaches that all</b> Jews are considered <b>guarantors,</b> i.e., responsible, <b>for one another.</b>

### Part 20
The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the verse in Leviticus, the reference is to a case <b>where</b> others <b>had the ability to protest</b> the sin <b>but they did not protest.</b> Consequently, they are punished for not protesting, regardless of any familial relationship they may have with the sinner.
