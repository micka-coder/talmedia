### Part 1
<b>she</b> could have <b>burned it.</b> Why did you not accept her testimony?

### Part 2
Rav Naḥman answered him: <b>Since</b> the promissory note <b>was ratified in court, we do not say</b> that she is deemed credible to nullify its validity because <b>if she had wanted</b> to, <b>she</b> could have <b>burned it.</b> The validity of a ratified document is not nullified without evidence.

### Part 3
<b>Rava raised an objection to</b> the ruling of <b>Rav Naḥman</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A receipt [<i>simfon</i>]</b> of repayment of a debt <b>upon which witnesses</b> are signed <b>is ratified by</b> means of <b>its signatories.</b> The witnesses testify that these are their signatures, and it is thereby ratified. If <b>there are no witnesses</b> signed <b>on it, but</b> the receipt <b>emerged from the possession of a third party</b> serving as a trustee, <b>or</b> if <b>it emerged after the signing of the documents,</b> i.e., the receipt was written on the promissory note beneath the content of the note and the witnesses’ signatures, it is <b>valid.</b> Rava states his objection: <b>Apparently,</b> the testimony of <b>a third party</b> serving as a trustee <b>is deemed credible,</b> as he can testify that the receipt is valid even if it was not signed by witnesses.

### Part 4
The Gemara concludes: <b>The refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman is</b> indeed <b>a conclusive refutation.</b>

### Part 5
§ <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> One <b>can always bring a proof</b> for his claim <b>and overturn</b> the previous verdict, <b>until his claims are stopped up,</b> i.e., until he has no more claims, <b>and he says: Come, so-and-so and so-and-so, and testify on my behalf,</b> in which case those witnesses are not allowed to testify.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>This matter itself</b> is <b>difficult.</b> When <b>you say:</b> Until <b>his claims are stopped up, we arrive at,</b> i.e., this represents, the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who hold in the mishna that once a litigant stops presenting his claims, he cannot present additional claims later. <b>And</b> when <b>you then say:</b> Until he says <b>come, so-and-so and so-and-so, and testify on my behalf, we arrive at</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</b> that it is only in that case that the testimony is not accepted.

### Part 7
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>the entire</b> statement is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, and</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>is explaining</b> his own statement, saying: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>Until his claims are stopped up? Until he says: Come, so-and-so and so-and-so, and testify on my behalf,</b> this is difficult. <b>But doesn’t Rabba bar bar Ḥana say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>anywhere that Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel taught</b> a ruling <b>in our Mishna,</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with his</b> opinion, <b>except for</b> the following three cases: The responsibility of the <b>guarantor, and</b> the incident that occurred in the city of <b>Tzaidan, and</b> the dispute with regard to <b>evidence</b> in the <b>final</b> disagreement? Evidently, the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis in this case.

### Part 8
<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara presents another version of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement. <b>When Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: One can always bring a proof and overturn</b> the previous verdict <b>until his claims are stopped up, and</b> the judges <b>say to him: Bring witnesses, and he says: I have no witnesses,</b> and they say to him: <b>Bring evidence, and he says: I have no evidence.</b> This is in accordance with the statement of the Rabbis in the mishna. <b>But</b> if <b>witnesses came from overseas, or</b> if <b>there was a saddlebag [<i>disakkaya</i>] of his father’s</b> documents <b>deposited by another</b> individual, which are cases where he did not know of the evidence, <b>he can bring</b> this <b>evidence and overturn</b> the previous verdict, as there is no concern of artifice.

### Part 9
§ <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>one who attacks another in judgment,</b> i.e., tenaciously raises legal claims against another, and <b>one</b> of the litigants <b>says: Let us go to court here</b> in our locale, <b>and</b> the other <b>one says: Let us go to the place of the Assembly,</b> i.e., the Sanhedrin, or another High Court, the former litigant <b>is compelled to go to the place of the Assembly.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Elazar said before him: My teacher,</b> if so, <b>must one who claims</b> a debt of <b>one hundred dinars from another spend one hundred dinars</b> of travel and lodging expenses <b>for</b> the <b>one hundred dinars</b> he wants to collect? <b>Rather,</b> one <b>is compelled to</b> appear and <b>be judged</b> in a court that presides <b>in his</b> own <b>city.</b>

### Part 11
<b>It was also stated</b> that <b>Rav Safra says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>two who were struggling in judgment, one</b> of whom <b>says: Let us go to court here, and one</b> of whom <b>says: Let us go to the place of the Assembly,</b> the latter litigant <b>is compelled to</b> appear and <b>be judged</b> in a court that presides <b>in his</b> own <b>city. And if</b> the local court <b>needs to ask</b> a higher court about a certain <b>matter,</b> the judges <b>write</b> to the Assembly, <b>and</b> the higher court <b>sends</b> its response.

### Part 12
<b>And if</b> one of the litigants <b>says</b> to a court: <b>Write for what reason you judged me</b> in this manner <b>and give</b> it <b>to me,</b> as I do not trust your decision without explanation, the judges <b>write</b> it <b>and give</b> it <b>to him.</b>

### Part 13
Another <i>halakha</i> was stated with regard to the location of the judgment: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>a woman whose husband had a brother,</b> and he <b>died childless [<i>vehayevama</i>],</b> she <b>follows her brother-in-law [<i>hayavam</i>]</b> for him <b>to free her</b> of the levirate bond through <i>ḥalitza</i>. The <i>yavam</i> does not have to go to her.

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>How far</b> does she have to go? <b>Rabbi Ami says: Even from Tiberias to Tzippori.</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> even though the court in Tiberias is more prestigious than the one in Tzippori.

### Part 15
<b>Rav Kahana says: What is the verse</b> that alludes to this <i>halakha</i>? It is the verse that states: <b>“Then the elders of his city shall call him,</b> and speak to him, and if he stands and says: I do not wish to take her” (Deuteronomy 25:8). The fact that the elders of his city, <b>and not the elders of her city,</b> are mentioned indicates that <i>ḥalitza</i> is performed in his city and not in hers.

### Part 16
<b>Ameimar says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that if one litigant wants to go to the place of the Assembly and the other does not, the latter <b>is compelled to go to the place of the Assembly. Rav Ashi said to Ameimar: But doesn’t Rabbi Elazar say</b> that <b>he is compelled</b> to appear and <b>be judged</b> in a court that presides <b>in his</b> own <b>city?</b> Ameimar answered: <b>This statement</b> applies in a case <b>where the borrower said to the lender:</b> Let us go to the place of the Assembly; in that case, the debtor is compelled to be judged in his city. <b>But</b> if the <b>lender</b> requests to go to the place of the Assembly, his request is accepted, as it is stated: <b>“The borrower is servant to the lender”</b> (Proverbs 22:7).

### Part 17
The Sages <b>sent</b> a letter <b>to Mar Ukva,</b> the Exilarch in Babylonia, which stated: <b>To he who has light</b> upon him, <b>like</b> Moses, who is called <b>the son of Bithiah, Shalom.</b> The letter continued: <b>Ukvan the Babylonian complained before us</b> as follows: <b>Yirmeya, my brother, came past me,</b> i.e., did me a great evil. <b>And</b> therefore <b>tell</b> Yirmeya; <b>induce him [<i>hassiuhu</i>] to see our face in Tiberias,</b> where we will judge his case.

### Part 18
The Gemara asks: <b>This</b> matter <b>itself</b> is <b>difficult</b> to understand. <b>You said: Tell him. Apparently</b> the intention was: <b>Judge him yourselves</b> in Babylonia. But then the letter states: <b>Induce him to see our face in Tiberias. Apparently</b> the intention was: <b>Send him here.</b>

### Part 19
<b>Rather, this</b> is what the Sages <b>were saying: Tell him,</b> i.e., <b>judge</b> him <b>yourselves. If he listens</b> to the court, <b>he listens,</b> and the issue is resolved. <b>But if</b> he does <b>not</b> listen, <b>induce him to see our face in Tiberias.</b>

### Part 20
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> That is not the correct understanding of the letter. Rather, <b>it was</b> a case pertaining to <b>the <i>halakhot</i> of fines, and in Babylonia</b> the courts <b>do not adjudicate</b> in cases pertaining to <b>the <i>halakhot</i> of fines,</b> as there are no ordained judges there; such Sages are found only in Eretz Yisrael. Consequently, it was necessary to send the case to Eretz Yisrael. <b>And</b> the fact <b>that they sent</b> the letter to Mar Ukva using <b>this</b> wording, as though he were capable of adjudicating the case himself, was <b>in order to give honor to Mar Ukva,</b> who was a Sage and a leader. They hinted to him that he could not judge this case and that he therefore had to send the defendant to Eretz Yisrael.
