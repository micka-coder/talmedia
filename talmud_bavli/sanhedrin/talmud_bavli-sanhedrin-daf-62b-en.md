### Part 1
<b>This</b> is the <i>baraita</i> that Rabbi Zakkai <b>taught before</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan: There is <b>a stringency with regard to Shabbat vis-à-vis other mitzvot,</b> and conversely, there is <b>a stringency with regard to other mitzvot vis-à-vis Shabbat.</b> There is <b>a stringency with regard to Shabbat, as</b> with regard to <b>Shabbat,</b> if one <b>performed two</b> distinct acts of labor <b>in one lapse of awareness,</b> he is <b>obligated</b> to bring a sin-offering <b>for each and every</b> act, <b>which is not so with regard to other mitzvot.</b> Conversely, there is <b>a stringency with regard to other mitzvot, as with regard to other mitzvot,</b> if one sinned <b>unwittingly, without intent</b> to perform the act of the transgression at all, he is nevertheless <b>obligated</b> to bring an offering, <b>which is not so with regard to Shabbat.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara examines this <i>baraita</i> in detail. <b>The Master said:</b> There is <b>a stringency with regard to Shabbat, as</b> with regard to <b>Shabbat,</b> if one <b>performed two</b> distinct acts of labor in one lapse of awareness, he is obligated to bring a sin-offering for each act. <b>What are the circumstances? If we say that</b> he unwittingly <b>performed</b> acts of <b>reaping and grinding</b> on Shabbat, <b>the corresponding</b> situation <b>with regard to other mitzvot</b> is a case <b>where</b> one unwittingly <b>consumed</b> forbidden <b>fat and blood.</b> If so, there is no difference between Shabbat and other mitzvot; <b>here,</b> one <b>is obligated</b> to bring <b>two</b> sin-offerings, <b>and there,</b> one <b>is obligated</b> to bring <b>two</b> sin-offerings.

### Part 3
<b>Rather, what are the circumstances with regard to other mitzvot where</b> one is <b>obligated</b> to bring <b>only one</b> sin-offering? One is obligated in a case <b>where he consumed</b> forbidden <b>fat and</b> again consumed forbidden <b>fat</b> within one lapse of awareness. <b>The corresponding</b> situation <b>with regard to Shabbat</b> is a case <b>where</b> one <b>performed</b> an act of <b>reaping and</b> performed another act of <b>reaping</b> within one lapse of awareness. In that case too there is no difference between Shabbat and other mitzvot; <b>here,</b> one <b>is obligated</b> to bring <b>one</b> sin-offering, <b>and there,</b> one <b>is obligated</b> to bring <b>one</b> sin-offering.

### Part 4
The Gemara comments: <b>And that is</b> the reason <b>that</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to</b> Rabbi Zakkai: <b>Go out</b> and <b>teach</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>outside;</b> it is not worthy of being taught in the study hall.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the difficulty</b> that caused Rabbi Yoḥanan to disregard the <i>baraita</i>? <b>Actually, perhaps I will say to you</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> one <b>performed</b> acts of <b>reaping and grinding</b> on Shabbat, and when the <i>baraita</i> states: <b>Which is not so with regard to other mitzvot,</b> it is not referring to all mitzvot in general; rather, <b>we arrive at</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>idol worship, in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ami. As Rabbi Ami says:</b> If one <b>sacrificed</b> an animal as an idolatrous offering <b>and burned</b> incense <b>and poured a libation,</b> all <b>in</b> the course of <b>one lapse of awareness, he is obligated to</b> bring <b>only one</b> sin-offering.

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> <b>cannot be interpreted</b> as referring <b>to idol worship, as it teaches in the last clause:</b> There is <b>a stringency with regard to other mitzvot, as with regard to other mitzvot,</b> if one sinned <b>unwittingly, without</b> the <b>intent</b> to perform the act at all, he is nevertheless <b>obligated</b> to bring an offering.

### Part 7
The Gemara explains why this cannot be referring to idol worship. <b>What are the circumstances</b> of one who <b>unwittingly</b> transgresses the prohibition of <b>idol worship without</b> the <b>intent</b> to perform the act? <b>If he thought</b> that a house of idol worship was <b>a synagogue and bowed to it,</b> he is certainly exempt, as <b>his heart was</b> directed <b>toward Heaven. Rather,</b> it must be a case <b>where</b> the transgressor <b>saw</b> the <b>statue</b> of a person <b>and bowed to it. If he accepted</b> that person <b>upon himself as a god, he is an intentional</b> transgressor and is liable to receive the death penalty, not to bring an offering. <b>And if he did not accept him upon himself</b> as a god, what he did <b>is nothing.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> must be referring to a case where one worshipped an idol <b>due to love or due to fear</b> of a person, and he was unaware that this is prohibited. <b>This works out well according to Abaye, who says</b> that one who engages in idol worship due to love or fear is <b>liable;</b> accordingly, one who does so unwittingly must bring an offering. <b>But according to Rava, who says</b> that one who does so is <b>exempt, what can be said?</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> must be referring to a case <b>where</b> the transgressor <b>says</b> to himself that idol worship is <b>permitted</b> in general. Accordingly, the statement in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Which is not so in</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>Shabbat,</b> is referring to one who was under the impression that performing labor on Shabbat is permitted. One <b>who</b> performs prohibited labor under those circumstances <b>is completely exempt,</b> while one who transgresses under those circumstances with regard to idol worship one is obligated to bring a sin-offering.

### Part 10
This interpretation of the <i>baraita</i> is difficult, as <b>Rava asked Rav Naḥman</b> about the <i>halakha</i> in a case where one violated Shabbat during <b>a lapse of awareness of</b> both <b>this,</b> that it was Shabbat, <b>and that</b> the particular labor that he performed is prohibited on Shabbat. And Rava’s question was <b>only</b> with regard to <b>whether to deem</b> the person <b>obligated</b> to bring <b>one</b> sin-offering or <b>whether to deem</b> him <b>obligated</b> to bring <b>two</b> sin-offerings. <b>There is no one who says</b> that such a person is <b>entirely exempt,</b> in accordance with this interpretation of the <i>baraita</i>. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> cannot be referring to idol worship.

### Part 11
The Gemara challenges this conclusion: <b>What is the difficulty</b> in interpreting the <i>baraita</i> as referring to idol worship? <b>Actually, perhaps I will say to you</b> that <b>the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to</b> the contrast between Shabbat and <b>idol worship, and the last clause</b> is referring <b>to</b> the contrast between Shabbat and <b>other mitzvot.</b>

### Part 12
<b>And</b> the <i>halakha</i> of one who transgressed other mitzvot <b>unwittingly, without intent</b> to perform the act, is referring to, e.g., a case <b>where</b> one has forbidden fat in his mouth and <b>thinks it is spittle, and he swallows it.</b> In that case he must bring an offering for his transgression, <b>which is not so with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>Shabbat, where</b> in a parallel case one would be <b>exempt. As,</b> for example, one who <b>intended to lift</b> a plant that was <b>detached</b> from the ground <b>and</b> mistakenly <b>severed</b> a plant still <b>attached</b> to the ground is <b>exempt.</b> One is not liable for an unintentional act of labor on Shabbat.

### Part 13
<b>And</b> this distinction is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>that Rav Naḥman</b> says that <b>Shmuel says, as he says: One who acts unawares with</b> forbidden <b>fats or with those with whom sexual relations are forbidden,</b> i.e., one who accidentally consumed forbidden fat or engaged in forbidden sexual intercourse, without intending to perform the act at all (see <i>Yevamot</i> 54a), is <b>obligated</b> to bring a sin-offering, <b>since he derived pleasure</b> from the transgression. But <b>one who acts unawares on Shabbat,</b> performing forbidden labor, is <b>exempt,</b> as <b>the Torah prohibits</b> only <b>planned labor.</b>

### Part 14
Since the <i>baraita</i> can be explained in this manner, the Gemara explains why Rabbi Yoḥanan rejected it anyway: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning,</b> in <b>that he does not interpret the first clause</b> of <b>a <i>baraita</i> with one explanation and the last clause</b> of the same <i>baraita</i> <b>with one</b> other <b>explanation.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan does not accept the premise that a <i>baraita</i> can be referring to a different matter in each clause unless it states so explicitly.

### Part 15
<b>As Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Whoever explains to me</b> the mishna concerning <b>a barrel</b> (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 40b) <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of one <i>tanna</i>, I will carry his clothes after him to the bathhouse,</b> i.e., I will attend him as a servant, as although that mishna can be explained by dividing it into two different opinions, I do not accept that type of explanation. Therefore, Rabbi Yoḥanan does not accept the suggestion that the first clause of the <i>baraita</i> here is referring to idol worship and the last clause is referring to other mitzvot.

### Part 16
§ The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself,</b> namely, whether one who engages in several forms of idol worship in the same lapse of awareness brings more than one sin-offering.
