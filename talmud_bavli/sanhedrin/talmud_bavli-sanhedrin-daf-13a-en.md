### Part 1
<b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The year must be intercalated only if <b>twenty-one days</b> of Tishrei will pass before the autumnal equinox. The Gemara explains: <b>And both of them expounded the same verse</b> to arrive at their respective opinions: “And <b>the Festival of the Ingathering at the turn of the year”</b> (Exodus 34:22). They both interpret the verse to mean that the Festival of the Ingathering, which is referring to the intermediate days of <i>Sukkot</i>, must take place during the season of Tishrei, i.e., autumn. One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds</b> that <b>we require all of the Festival</b> to take place <b>in the new season,</b> after the equinox. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yosei, <b>holds</b> that <b>we require</b> only <b>some of the Festival,</b> even one day, to take place <b>in the new season,</b> so the year must be intercalated only if the equinox would fall on the twenty-second of Tishrei or later.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>What do they</b> each <b>hold? If they hold</b> that the <b>day of</b> the <b>equinox concludes</b> the season, meaning that it is counted as part of the preceding season, then <b>even</b> if the season of Tammuz <b>is not</b> lacking more than <b>this</b> number of days until its completion, the year would need to be intercalated. <b>According to the one who says</b> that we require <b>all of the Festival</b> to take place in the new season, this <b>is not</b> sufficient to rectify the problem, as the sixteenth of Tishrei, which is the beginning of the Festival of the Ingathering, is still in the old season. <b>And</b> even <b>according to the one who says</b> we require only <b>some of the Festival</b> to take place in the new season, this <b>is</b> also <b>not</b> sufficient to rectify the problem, since if the equinox occurs on the twenty-first of Tishrei, the new season begins only on the twenty-second, after the Festival of the Ingathering is over. <b>Rather, they</b> certainly both <b>hold</b> that <b>the day of the equinox begins</b> the new season.

### Part 3
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to this conclusion from a different <i>baraita</i>: <b>The day of the equinox concludes</b> the season; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei says: The day of the equinox begins</b> the season. It is therefore clear that they disagree about this issue, and that the previous <i>baraita</i> must be explained differently.

### Part 4
<b>And furthermore, it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:7): The court <b>intercalates the year only if the season</b> of Tammuz <b>was lacking</b> its completion for <b>most of the month</b> of Tishrei. <b>And how much</b> is: <b>Most of the month? Sixteen days. Rabbi Yehuda says: Two parts,</b> meaning two-thirds, <b>of the month. And how much is: Two parts of the month? Twenty days,</b> since in that case the day of the equinox would fall on the twenty-first, and since according to Rabbi Yehuda the day of the equinox concludes the season, the new season would begin on the following day, after the Festival of the Ingathering has ended.

### Part 5
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The court <b>calculates</b> the seasons, and if the winter season of Tevet, which is <b>before Passover,</b> is lacking its completion for <b>sixteen</b> days into the month of Nisan, the court <b>intercalates</b> the year, so that Passover will occur within the season of Nisan, i.e., the spring. But if the summer season of Tammuz, which is <b>before the Festival</b> of the Ingathering, is lacking its completion for <b>sixteen</b> days into the month of Tishrei, the court <b>does not intercalate</b> it. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Even</b> if the season <b>before the Festival</b> of the Ingathering is lacking its completion for <b>sixteen</b> days into the month of Tishrei, the court does <b>intercalate</b> the year. The <i>tanna</i> referred to as <b>Aḥerim says:</b> The year is intercalated even on account of <b>a minority of</b> the month, <b>and how much is a minority of</b> the month? <b>Fourteen days.</b> The Gemara concludes: Comparing the various <i>baraitot</i> poses <b>a difficulty,</b> as they appear to contradict one another.

### Part 6
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The year must be intercalated if the season of Tammuz is lacking its completion for <b>two parts of the month</b> of Tishrei, which is <b>twenty days. Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The court <b>calculates</b> the seasons, and if the season of Tevet, which is <b>before Passover,</b> is lacking its completion for <b>sixteen</b> days into the month of Nisan, the court <b>intercalates</b> the year. The Gemara challenges: <b>That is</b> the same as the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> since a calculation that shows the winter season of a given year to be lacking its completion for sixteen days of Nisan will also show the summer season of that year will be lacking its completion for twenty days of Tishrei.

### Part 7
The Gemara explains: The difference <b>between them</b> concerns the question of whether the <b>day of the equinox concludes</b> the season, <b>or the day of the equinox begins</b> the season. Rabbi Yehuda holds that the day of the equinox concludes the season, and therefore in the given scenario the year must be intercalated so that some of the Festival of the Ingathering will occur in the season of Tishrei. But according to Rabbi Yosei this is not a concern, as the day of the equinox begins the season. Nevertheless, the year must be intercalated so that Passover will occur in the season of Nisan.

### Part 8
<b>The Master says:</b> In the continuation of his statement, Rabbi Yosei said: If the summer season of Tammuz, which is <b>before the Festival</b> of the Ingathering, is lacking its completion for <b>sixteen</b> days into the month of Tishrei, the court <b>does not intercalate</b> the year. The Gemara challenges: <b>Rather, according to Rabbi Yosei,</b> if the season <b>before the Festival is</b> lacking its completion for <b>sixteen</b> days into the month of Tishrei, this <b>is</b> the situation <b>when</b> the court does <b>not</b> intercalate the year. <b>But</b> can one therefore infer that if it is lacking its completion for <b>seventeen or eighteen</b> days into the month of Tishrei, the court does <b>intercalate</b> the year?

### Part 9
The Gemara explains the difficulty: <b>But doesn’t</b> he <b>say:</b> The court calculates the seasons, and if the winter season of Tevet, which is <b>before Passover,</b> is lacking its completion for <b>sixteen</b> days into the month of Nisan, <b>yes,</b> the court <b>intercalates</b> the year; but if it is lacking its completion for <b>less</b> than that, it should <b>not</b> be intercalated, even if the season before the Festival of the Ingathering will be lacking seventeen or eighteen days? The two elements of Rabbi Yosei’s statement appear to contradict one another.

### Part 10
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> those inferences are not correct. Rather, in both <b>this</b> case <b>and that</b> case, the court <b>does not intercalate</b> the year, <b>and since it taught</b> in <b>the first clause: Sixteen</b> days <b>before Passover, it also taught: Sixteen</b> days <b>before the Festival</b> of the Ingathering, but one cannot infer from this that it means sixteen days and no more.

### Part 11
The <i>baraita</i> teaches that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Even</b> if the season <b>before the Festival</b> of the Ingathering is lacking its completion for <b>sixteen</b> days into the month of Tishrei, the court does <b>intercalate</b> the year. The Gemara asks: If so, <b>this is</b> apparently the same as the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>;</b> what is the difference between Rabbi Shimon’s opinion and that of the first <i>tanna</i>?
