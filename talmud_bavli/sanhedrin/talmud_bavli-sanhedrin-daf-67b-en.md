### Part 1
<b>one</b> type of <b>death</b> penalty, namely, decapitation. Since that is the only type of capital punishment that applies to gentiles, it cannot be derived through a verbal analogy that the same type applies to a Jewish sorceror.

### Part 2
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Ben Azzai says</b> that <b>it is stated: “You shall not allow a witch to live”</b> (Exodus 22:17), <b>and it is stated</b> in the following verse: <b>“Whoever lies with an animal shall be put to death”</b> (Exodus 22:18). The fact that the Torah <b>juxtaposes this matter to that</b> matter is <b>to</b> teach that <b>just as</b> one who <b>lies with an animal</b> is executed <b>by stoning</b> (see Leviticus, chapter 20), <b>so too, a warlock</b> is executed <b>by stoning.</b>

### Part 3
With regard to this derivation, <b>Rabbi Yehuda said to him: And because</b> the Torah <b>juxtaposes this matter with that</b> matter, <b>shall we take this</b> person <b>out to be stoned?</b> Should he be sentenced to the most severe type of capital punishment on that basis? <b>Rather,</b> the source is as follows: <b>A necromancer and a sorcerer were</b> included <b>in the</b> general <b>category of warlocks, and why were they singled out</b> from the rest, with their prohibition and punishment stated independently? This was done in order <b>to draw an analogy to them and say to you: Just as a necromancer and a sorcerer</b> are executed <b>by stoning, so too, a warlock</b> is executed <b>by stoning.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda as well, let</b> the punishment with regard to <b>a necromancer and a sorcerer be</b> considered <b>two verses that come as one,</b> i.e., that teach the same matter, <b>and</b> therefore the <i>halakha</i> of other cases cannot be derived from it, according to the principle that <b>any two verses that come as one do not teach</b> about other cases. In other words, if a <i>halakha</i> is taught with regard to two individual cases in the Torah, the understanding is that this <i>halakha</i> applies only to those cases. Had this <i>halakha</i> applied to all other relevant cases as well, it would not have been necessary for the Torah to teach it twice. The fact that two cases are mentioned indicates that they are the exceptions rather than the rule.

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Zekharya says: This means</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that <b>two verses that come as one do teach</b> about other cases.

### Part 6
§ <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Why</b> is sorcery <b>called <i>keshafim</i>? Because</b> it is an acronym for: <b>Contradicts the heavenly entourage [<i>shemakhḥishin pamalia shel mala</i>].</b> Sorcery appears to contradict the laws of nature established by God.

### Part 7
The verse states: “To you it was shown, so that you should know that the Lord is God; <b>there is none else besides Him”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:35). <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> This is true <b>even</b> with regard <b>to a matter of sorcery;</b> sorcery is ineffective against a righteous person.

### Part 8
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain woman who was attempting to take dust from under the feet of Rabbi Ḥanina</b> in order to perform sorcery on him and harm him. Rabbi Ḥanina <b>said to her: If you succeed, go</b> and <b>do</b> it. I am not concerned about it, as <b>it is written: “There is none else besides Him.”</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say: Why</b> are sorcerers <b>called <i>mekhashefim</i>? Because</b> it is an acronym for: <b>Contradicts the heavenly entourage.</b> This indicates that one should be wary of sorcery. The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Ḥanina is different, as his merit is great,</b> and sorcery certainly has no effect on such a righteous person.

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Aivu bar Nagri says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that in the verse: “And the magicians of Egypt did in that manner <b>with their secret arts [<i>belateihem</i>]”</b> (Exodus 7:22), <b>these</b> words <b>are</b> describing <b>acts of</b> employing <b>demons,</b> which are invisible, and their actions are therefore hidden [<i>balat</i>]. With regard to the similar term <b>“<i>belahateihem</i>”</b> (Exodus 7:11), <b>these are acts of sorcery,</b> which sorcerers perform themselves, without using demons. <b>And likewise it says: “And the flaming [<i>lahat</i>] sword that turned every way”</b> (Genesis 3:24), referring to a sword that revolves by itself.

### Part 11
<b>Abaye says:</b> A sorcerer <b>who is particular about</b> using a certain <b>utensil</b> for his sorcery is employing <b>a demon;</b> one <b>who is not particular about</b> using a certain <b>utensil</b> is performing an act of <b>sorcery.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Abaye says: The <i>halakhot</i> of sorcery are like the <i>halakhot</i> of Shabbat,</b> in that their actions can be divided into three categories: <b>There are</b> some <b>of them</b> for which one is liable to be executed <b>by stoning, and there are</b> some <b>of them</b> for which one is <b>exempt</b> from punishment by Torah law <b>but</b> they are <b>prohibited</b> by rabbinic law, <b>and there are</b> some <b>of them</b> that are <b>permitted <i>ab initio</i>.</b>

### Part 13
Abaye elaborates: <b>One who performs</b> a real <b>act</b> of sorcery is liable to be executed <b>by stoning. One who deceives the eyes is exempt</b> from punishment, <b>but</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> for him to do so. What is <b>permitted <i>ab initio</i></b> is to act <b>like Rav Ḥanina and Rav Oshaya: Every Shabbat eve they would engage in</b> the study of <b>the <i>halakhot</i> of creation, and a third-born calf would be created for them, and they would eat it</b> in honor of Shabbat.

### Part 14
<b>Rav Ashi said: I saw Karna’s father</b> perform a magic trick in <b>which he would blow</b> his nose <b>and cast rolls of silk from his nostrils</b> by deceiving the eye.

### Part 15
With regard to the verse: <b>“And the magicians said to Pharaoh: This is the finger of God”</b> (Exodus 8:15), <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> It is derived <b>from here that a demon cannot create an entity smaller than</b> the size of <b>a barley grain.</b> Consequently, the magicians were not capable of duplicating the plague of lice, and they realized that this was not an act of sorcery but was performed by God.

### Part 16
<b>Rav Pappa said: By God! They cannot create even</b> an entity as large <b>as a camel.</b> They do not create anything. Rather, <b>they can gather these</b> large animals, leading them from one place to another, <b>but they cannot gather those</b> small animals.

### Part 17
<b>Rav said to Rabbi Ḥiyya: I myself saw a certain Arab who took a sword and sliced a camel and</b> then <b>beat a drum [<i>betavla</i>], and</b> the camel <b>arose</b> from the dead. Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>said to him: Was there blood and excretion afterward</b> in that place, which flowed from the camel when it was sliced? <b>Rather,</b> since there was none, <b>that was</b> clearly <b>a deception of the eyes</b> and not sorcery.

### Part 18
The Gemara relates: <b>Ze’eiri happened</b> to come <b>to Alexandria of Egypt. He bought a donkey. When he was about to give it</b> water <b>to drink</b> the magic <b>thawed</b> when the donkey touched the water and it was revealed that it was not a donkey, <b>and it turned into the plank of a bridge.</b> The ones who sold it to him <b>said to him: If you were not Ze’eiri,</b> a distinguished person, <b>we would not refund you</b> the money for the donkey. <b>Is there</b> anyone <b>who buys an item here and does not examine it</b> first <b>with water?</b> Since sorcery was widespread there, anyone who bought an item examined it in order to find out if it was affected by sorcery, and if one did not examine an acquired item by exposing it to water and it turned out to be under a spell, he suffered the loss.

### Part 19
The Gemara relates: A man named <b>Yannai arrived at a certain inn. He said to</b> the innkeepers: <b>Give me water to drink. They brought</b> him <b>flour mixed with water. He saw that the lips of</b> the innkeeper woman <b>were moving,</b> and he <b>cast a bit of</b> the drink to the ground, and it <b>turned into scorpions,</b> and he understood that the innkeepers performed sorcery on the drink. Yannai <b>said to them: I drank from yours; you too drink from mine,</b> and he also performed sorcery on the drink. <b>He gave</b> it to <b>her to drink</b> and <b>she turned into a donkey. He rode upon her</b> and <b>went to the marketplace. Her friend came</b> and <b>released her</b> from the sorcery, <b>and</b> people <b>saw him riding on a woman in the marketplace.</b>

### Part 20
It is stated with regard to the plagues of Egypt: <b>“And the frog came up and covered the land of Egypt”</b> (Exodus 8:2). Noting that the term “the frog” is written in the singular, <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> At first <b>it was one frog; it spawned and filled the entire land of Egypt</b> with frogs.

### Part 21
The Gemara comments: This matter is <b>subject to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>: Rabbi Akiva says: It was one frog, and it</b> spawned and <b>filled the entire land of Egypt</b> with frogs. <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya said to him: Akiva, what are you doing</b> occupying yourself <b>with</b> the study of <b><i>aggada</i>?</b> This is not your field of expertise. <b>Take your statements to</b> the tractates of <b><i>Nega’im</i> and <i>Oholot</i>.</b> In other words, it is preferable that you teach the <i>halakhot</i> of the impurity of leprosy and the impurity imparted in a tent, which are among the most difficult areas of <i>halakha</i> and are within your field of expertise. Rather, the verse is to be understood as follows: <b>It was one frog; it whistled to</b> the other frogs, <b>and they</b> all <b>came</b> after it.

### Part 22
§ In the mishna, <b>Rabbi Akiva says</b> in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua that two people can each gather cucumbers by sorcery, one of whom is exempt, as he merely deceives the eyes, and one of whom is liable, as he performs real sorcery.
