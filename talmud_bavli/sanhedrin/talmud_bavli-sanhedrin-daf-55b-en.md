### Part 1
evident <b>from</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause</b> of the mishna includes two reasons for the killing of the animal, namely both the <b>calamity and</b> the <b>shame</b> caused by the animal, that <b>the first clause,</b> the first reason stated in the mishna, is referring to a case of <b>a calamity with-out shame? And what are the circumstances</b> of a calamity without shame? It is the case of <b>a gentile who engages in intercourse with an animal.</b> In that case there is a calamity, as the gentile is executed, but his shame is not the concern of the Jewish court.

### Part 2
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>No. The latter clause</b> is referring to a case of both <b>a calamity and shame,</b> but <b>this first clause teaches us that even</b> in a case where there is a circumstance of <b>shame</b> alone <b>without</b> the <b>calamity</b> of execution, the court <b>is obligated</b> to kill the animal. Although the mishna employs the term: Calamity, it is possible that this is referring to the calamity of the transgression, not the execution of the transgressor. <b>And what are the circumstances</b> of this case? It is a case of <b>a Jew who unwittingly engages in intercourse with an animal, and</b> this is just <b>like</b> the case about <b>which Rav Hamnuna raises a dilemma.</b>

### Part 3
<b>As Rav Hamnuna raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>a Jew who unwittingly engages in intercourse with an animal, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is the animal stoned to death? <b>Do we need</b> both <b>a calamity and shame</b> in order to put it to death, <b>and</b> therefore <b>here</b> the animal is not killed, as <b>there is shame,</b> but <b>there is no calamity</b> of execution, <b>or perhaps shame</b> is enough, <b>even if there is no calamity?</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rav Yosef says: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from a mishna (<i>Nidda</i> 44b): A girl who is <b>three years and one day old</b> whose father arranged her betrothal <b>is betrothed with intercourse,</b> as the legal status of intercourse with her is that of full-fledged intercourse. <b>And</b> in a case where the childless husband of a girl who is three years and one day old dies, <b>if</b> his brother, the <b><i>yavam</i>, engages in intercourse with her, he acquires her</b> as his wife; <b>and</b> if she is married, a man other than her husband is <b>liable for</b> engaging in intercourse with <b>her due to</b> the prohibition of intercourse with <b>a married woman.</b>

### Part 5
The mishna continues: <b>And</b> if she is impure due to menstruation, <b>she transmits impurity to one who engages in intercourse with her,</b> who then <b>renders</b> all the items designated for <b>lying beneath</b> him <b>impure like</b> the items designated for lying <b>above</b> him. If <b>she marries a priest, she may partake of <i>teruma</i></b> like any other wife of a priest. If she is unmarried and <b>one</b> of the men <b>who are unfit</b> for the priesthood, e.g., a <i>mamzer</i> or <i>ḥalal</i>, <b>engages in intercourse with her, he has disqualified her from</b> marrying into <b>the priesthood,</b> and if she is the daughter of a priest, she is disqualified from partaking of <i>teruma</i>.

### Part 6
The mishna continues: <b>And if one of any of those with whom relations are forbidden, who are stated in the Torah, engaged in intercourse with her,</b> e.g., her father or father-in-law, <b>they are executed</b> by the court <b>for</b> engaging in intercourse with <b>her, and she is exempt</b> because she is a minor.

### Part 7
The Gemara infers: <b>One of any of those with whom relations are forbidden</b> apparently includes <b>even an animal. And here, there is shame</b> but <b>there is no calamity,</b> as she is not executed due to her status as a minor, <b>and</b> yet the mishna <b>teaches: They are executed for</b> engaging in intercourse with <b>her.</b> Evidently, the animal is killed.

### Part 8
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>Since she</b> committed this transgression <b>intentionally, there is a calamity as well, and it is the Merciful One who has pity on her</b> due to her young age, and exempts her from punishment. And although the Merciful One <b>has pity on her, He does not have pity on the animal.</b> Therefore, it cannot be proven from here that shame without a calamity is sufficient cause for the animal to be put to death, because calamity is present in this case.

### Part 9
<b>Rava says: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the subsequent mishna (<i>Nidda</i> 45a): With regard to a boy who is <b>nine years and one day old,</b> whose brother died childless, and <b>who engaged in intercourse with his <i>yevama</i>,</b> his brother’s widow, the status of the intercourse is that of full-fledged intercourse and <b>he has acquired her</b> as his wife, <b>but</b> if he chooses to end the marriage, <b>he cannot give</b> her <b>a bill of divorce until he reaches majority. And he becomes ritually impure like a menstruating woman</b> after engaging in intercourse with her, and then <b>renders</b> all the items designated for <b>lying beneath</b> him <b>impure like</b> the items designated for lying <b>above</b> him.

### Part 10
The mishna continues: If he is disqualified from the priesthood and engages in intercourse with the daughter of a priest, <b>he disqualifies</b> her from partaking of <i>teruma</i>; <b>but</b> if he is a priest who marries an Israelite woman, <b>he does not enable</b> her <b>to partake</b> of <i>teruma</i>. <b>And</b> if he engages in intercourse with an animal, <b>he disqualifies the animal from</b> being sacrificed <b>upon the altar, and</b> the animal <b>is stoned on</b> the basis of intercourse with <b>him. And if he engaged in intercourse with one of any of those with whom relations are forbidden, who are stated in the Torah, they are executed</b> by the court <b>on</b> the basis of intercourse with <b>him,</b> but he is exempt.

### Part 11
The Gemara infers: <b>And here,</b> in a case where he engages in intercourse with an animal, <b>there is shame,</b> but <b>there is no calamity, and</b> yet the mishna <b>teaches</b> that the animal <b>is stoned on</b> the basis of intercourse with <b>him,</b> indicating that shame is sufficient for the animal to be killed.

### Part 12
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>Since he</b> committed this transgression <b>intentionally, there is a calamity as well, and it is the Merciful One who has pity on him</b> due to his minority. Although <b>the Merciful One has pity on him, the Merciful One does not have pity on the animal.</b> Therefore, it cannot be proven from here that shame without a calamity is sufficient cause for the animal to be put to death, because calamity is present in this case.

### Part 13
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from the mishna (54a): <b>Alternatively,</b> it is <b>so that</b> this <b>animal will not pass through the marketplace, and</b> those who see it <b>will say: This is</b> the animal <b>because of which so-and-so was stoned. What, is it not</b> evident <b>from</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause</b> of the mishna includes two reasons for the killing of the animal, namely both the <b>calamity and</b> the <b>shame</b> caused by the animal, that <b>the first clause,</b> the first reason stated in the mishna, is referring to a case of <b>shame without a calamity? And what are the circumstances</b> of shame without a calamity? It is the case of <b>a Jew who unwittingly engages in intercourse with an animal.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>No,</b> perhaps <b>the latter clause</b> is referring to a case where there is both <b>a calamity and shame,</b> while <b>the first clause</b> is referring to a case where there is <b>a calamity without shame. And what are the circumstances</b> of a calamity without shame? It is the case of <b>a gentile who engages in intercourse with an animal, as</b> the students <b>asked Rav Sheshet.</b> The dilemma is left unresolved. No conclusive answer can be inferred from the mishna for either this dilemma or for the dilemma raised by the students of Rav Sheshet.

### Part 15
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who blasphemes,</b> i.e., one who curses God, <b>is not liable unless he utters the name</b> of God and curses it. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa said:</b>
