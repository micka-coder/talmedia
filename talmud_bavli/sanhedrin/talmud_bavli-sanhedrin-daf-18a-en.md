### Part 1
The number of people needed in a city for it to be eligible for a lesser Sanhedrin is <b>277.</b> This number is based on the opinion of Rabbi Neḥemya, who requires 230 men, but requires an additional 47 men in case it happens that the Sages of the court reach a situation where they are not able to arrive at a verdict, and pairs of judges need to be added, potentially increasing the number of judges on the court from 23 to 70, a maximum of 47 additional judges.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The number of men needed in a city for it to be eligible for a lesser Sanhedrin is <b>278?</b> The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i> that said Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi requires 277 residents is stated in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who holds that there are 70 judges on the Great Sanhedrin, and <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> that quoted the number as 278 is stated in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who hold that there are 71.

### Part 3
Apropos the opinion of Rabbi Neḥemya, which links the issue of the lesser Sanhedrin with the appointment of the ministers in the wilderness, the Gemara relates: <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states: <b>“And place over them ministers of thousands, ministers of hundreds, ministers of fifties, and ministers of tens”</b> (Exodus 18:21). The number of <b>ministers of thousands</b> was <b>600,</b> as there were 600,000 men in total; the number of <b>ministers of hundreds</b> was <b>6,000;</b> of <b>ministers of fifties, 12,000,</b> and of <b>ministers of tens, 60,000.</b> Therefore, <b>it is found</b> that the total number of <b>judges of the Jewish people</b> was <b>78,600,</b> and suitable people were found to fill all of these positions.
