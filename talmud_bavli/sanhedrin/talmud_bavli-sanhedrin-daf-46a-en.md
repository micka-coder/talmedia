### Part 1
<b>Now that</b> the generalization and the detail <b>are distant from each other,</b> i.e., they are written in different verses, the verses <b>serve to include</b> one who was found guilty of <b>idol worship, as he is similar to</b> the blasphemer <b>in all matters.</b> He too is subject to be hung after he is executed.

### Part 2
<b>And Rabbi Eliezer,</b> by contrast, <b>interprets</b> the verses based on the principle of <b>amplifications and restrictions.</b> The phrase <b>“And he is put to death, and you shall hang</b> him” is <b>an amplification.</b> The phrase <b>“For</b> he that is hung is <b>a curse of</b> God” is <b>a restriction. Were</b> the amplification and the restriction right <b>next to each other, we would</b> apply the principle of amplifications and restrictions and <b>include only</b> one who is guilty of <b>idol worship, as he is similar to</b> the blasphemer <b>in all ways. Now that they are distant from each other,</b> the verses <b>serve to include</b> all <b>those who are</b> liable to be <b>stoned</b> to death. All of their corpses are hung after they are put to death.

### Part 3
§ The mishna teaches that according to the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, the corpse of <b>a man is hung</b> facing the people while the corpse of a woman is hung facing the tree, whereas the Rabbis say that the corpse of a woman is not hung at all. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning</b> behind the opinion <b>of the Rabbis?</b> The Gemara answers: As <b>the verse states:</b> “And if a man has committed a sin worthy of death, and he is put to death, <b>and you shall hang him</b> on a tree” (Deuteronomy 21:22), which teaches that you shall hang <b>him</b> on a tree after his death, <b>but</b> you shall <b>not</b> hang <b>her</b> on a tree after her death. <b>And Rabbi Eliezer</b> would respond that that the inference to be drawn from this verse is that after his death they hang <b>him</b> by himself, <b>without his clothing.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> from where do <b>the Rabbis</b> derive that the corpse of the executed man is hung without his clothing? The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, it is indeed so</b> that they agree that the word “him” teaches that the corpse is hung without clothing. <b>But</b> the source of their ruling is <b>the verse</b> that <b>states: “And if a man has committed a sin,”</b> which indicates that <b>a man</b> is hung after he is put to death, <b>but a woman</b> is <b>not</b> hung after she is put to death.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Eliezer, what does he learn from this</b> clause of the verse: <b>“And if a man</b> has committed a sin”? <b>Reish Lakish says: That</b> clause of the verse serves <b>to exclude a stubborn and rebellious son,</b> who, according to the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, is not hung after he is executed, because he is not a man. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> explicitly in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A stubborn and rebellious son is</b> first <b>stoned and</b> afterward his corpse is <b>hung;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer? Rather, Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says:</b> That part of the verse comes <b>to include a stubborn and rebellious son,</b> that his corpse is also hung. <b>What is the reason</b> for this?

### Part 6
The Gemara explains: <b>As the verse states: “And if a man has committed a sin,”</b> indicating that only the corpse of <b>a man</b> is hung, <b>but not</b> that of <b>a child,</b> thereby excluding a stubborn and rebellious son. And the word <b>“sin”</b> indicates that only the corpse of <b>one who is put to death on account of a sin</b> is hung, <b>to the exclusion of a stubborn and rebellious son, who is executed</b> not because of a sin that he has already committed but <b>on account of</b> what he is likely to do in <b>the future. This is</b> an example of <b>a restrictive expression following a restrictive expression,</b> as both expressions indicate that a stubborn and rebellious son is not hung after he is put to death. <b>And</b> there is a hermeneutical principle that <b>a restrictive expression following a restrictive expression</b> serves <b>only to amplify</b> the <i>halakha</i> and include additional cases. In this case, it serves to teach that the corpse of a stubborn and rebellious son is hung after he is put to death.

### Part 7
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Eliezer said to</b> the Rabbis: <b>Did Shimon ben Shataḥ not hang in Ashkelon women</b> who were found guilty of witchcraft? And the Rabbis replied that no proof can be brought from there since he hanged eighty women on a single day, which clearly indicates that this was an extraordinary measure and therefore cannot serve as a precedent for normative <i>halakha</i>. <b>Rav Ḥisda says: They taught</b> that one court may not judge two capital cases on one day <b>only when</b> the two cases involve <b>two</b> different modes of <b>execution, but when</b> they involve only <b>one</b> mode of <b>execution,</b> the court <b>may</b> in fact <b>judge</b> them on the same day. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But the incident</b> relating to <b>Shimon ben Shataḥ involved</b> only <b>one</b> mode of <b>execution,</b> as all the women were accused of witchcraft, and <b>yet</b> the Rabbis <b>said to him that</b> the court <b>may not judge</b> them on one day.

### Part 8
<b>Rather, if</b> a ruling <b>was stated</b> citing Rav Ḥisda, <b>this is</b> what <b>was stated: They taught</b> that one court may not judge two capital cases on one day <b>only when</b> the two cases involving <b>one</b> mode of <b>execution</b> are <b>similar to</b> two cases involving <b>two</b> different modes of <b>execution. And what are the circumstances</b> of such a situation? <b>For example,</b> when there are <b>two</b> different <b>transgressions</b> that are punishable by the same mode of execution, the court may not judge two such cases in one day. <b>But</b> where there is only <b>one</b> mode of <b>execution and</b> only <b>one transgression,</b> the court <b>may</b> in fact <b>judge</b> two cases on one day.

### Part 9
<b>Rav Adda bar Ahava raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> that states: The same court <b>may not judge two</b> people charged with capital transgressions <b>on one day,</b> not <b>even an adulterer and an adulteress.</b> This indicates that a court may not judge two cases on one day even if the two cases involve only one mode of execution and the same transgression. <b>Rav Ḥisda interpreted</b> the <i>baraita</i> as referring to a case of adultery involving <b>the daughter of a priest and the man with whom she engaged in intercourse,</b> as the daughter of a priest is liable to receive death by burning, while the man is liable to receive death by stoning if the woman was betrothed to another man, or strangulation if she was married to another man.

### Part 10
<b>Or,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case of adultery involving <b>the daughter of a priest and those who rendered as conspiring witnesses</b> the witnesses who <b>rendered as conspiring witnesses</b> the witnesses who testified about <b>her.</b>

### Part 11
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: I heard that the court may administer lashes and</b> capital <b>punishment,</b> even <b>when not</b> required <b>by Torah</b> law. <b>And</b> they may <b>not</b> administer these punishments with the intention <b>of violating the statement of the Torah,</b> i.e., to disregard the punishment stated in the Torah and administer another punishment; <b>rather,</b> they may administer these punishments <b>to erect a fence around the Torah,</b> so that people will fear sinning.

### Part 12
<b>And an incident</b> occurred <b>involving one who rode a horse on Shabbat during the days of the Greeks, and they brought him to court and stoned him, not because he deserved that</b> punishment, as riding a horse on Shabbat is forbidden only by rabbinic decree, <b>but because the hour required it,</b> as people had become lax in their observance of Shabbat and therefore it became necessary to impose the severe punishment for a relatively minor offense. <b>Another incident</b> occurred <b>involving a man who engaged in intercourse with his wife</b> in public <b>under a fig tree, and they brought him to court and flogged him, not because that</b> punishment <b>was fitting</b> for him, as such conduct is not forbidden by the Torah, <b>but because the hour required it.</b> People had become remiss in matters of modesty; therefore, stringent measures had to be taken to rectify the situation.

### Part 13
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>How do they hang</b> the corpse of one who was put to death by stoning? <b>They sink a post into the earth</b> with a piece of <b>wood jutting out,</b> forming a T-shaped structure. <b>And</b> the court appointee then <b>places</b> the dead man’s <b>two hands one upon the other,</b> ties them, <b>and hangs him</b> by his hands. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: The post</b> is not sunk into the ground; rather, it <b>leans against a wall, and he hangs</b> the corpse on it <b>the way that butchers do</b> with meat.

### Part 14
The dead man hangs there for only a very short time, <b>and</b> then <b>they immediately untie him. And if he was left</b> hanging <b>overnight, a prohibition is transgressed, as it is stated: “His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but you shall bury him</b> that day, <b>for he that is hung is a curse of God”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:23). <b>That is to say:</b> Were the corpse left hanging on the tree overnight, people would ask: <b>For what</b> reason <b>was this one hung</b> after he was put to death? They would be answered: <b>Because he blessed God,</b> a euphemism for blasphemy. <b>And therefore the name of Heaven would be desecrated</b> were the dead man’s corpse to remain hanging, reminding everybody of his transgression.

### Part 15
<b>Rabbi Meir said:</b> The phrase “for he that is hung is a curse [<i>kilelat</i>] of God” should be understood as follows: <b>When a man suffers</b> in the wake of his sin, <b>what expression does the Divine Presence use? I am distressed [<i>kallani</i>] about My head, I am distressed about My arm,</b> meaning, I, too, suffer when the wicked are punished. From here it is derived: <b>If God suffers</b> such distress <b>over the blood of the wicked that is spilled,</b> even though they justly deserved their punishment, it can be inferred <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> that He suffers distress <b>over the blood of the righteous.</b>

### Part 16
<b>And</b> the Sages <b>said not only this,</b> that an executed transgressor must be buried on the same day that he is killed, <b>but</b> they said that <b>anyone who leaves his deceased</b> relative <b>overnight</b> with-out burying him <b>transgresses a prohibition.</b> But if <b>he left</b> the deceased <b>overnight for the sake of</b> the deceased’s <b>honor,</b> e.g., <b>to bring a coffin or shrouds</b> for his burial, <b>he does not transgress</b> the prohibition against leaving him unburied overnight.

### Part 17
After the executed transgressor is taken down he is buried, <b>and they would not bury him in his ancestral</b> burial <b>plot. Rather, two graveyards were established for</b> the burial of those executed by <b>the court: One for those who were killed</b> by decapitation <b>or strangled, and one for those who were stoned or burned.</b> Once <b>the flesh</b> of the deceased <b>had decomposed, they would gather his bones and bury them in their</b> proper <b>place</b> in his ancestral burial plot. <b>And</b> soon after the execution, <b>the relatives</b> of the executed transgressor <b>would come and inquire about the welfare of the judges and about the welfare of the witnesses, as if to say: We hold no</b> grudges <b>against you, as you judged a true judgment.</b>
