### Part 1
<b>And everyone would hide. When</b> the head tax collector <b>would arrive,</b> Rabbi Zeira’s father <b>would say to him: From whom shall I request</b> taxes? The city is scarcely populated, and only a small sum of taxes should be imposed on it.

### Part 2
<b>When he was dying, he said to</b> those standing around his deathbed: <b>Take thirteen <i>ma’a</i> that are tied up in my sheet and return them to so-and-so, as I took them from him but I did not need them</b> to pay the tax. Evidently, some tax collectors are God-fearing, and should not be disqualified.

### Part 3
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Shimon said: Initially</b> people <b>would call them: Gatherers</b> of the produce <b>of the Sabbatical</b> Year. Once the tax collectors grew abundant they would then call them: Merchants who trade in the produce of the Sabbatical Year.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>What is he saying?</b> What is Rabbi Shimon teaching in this statement? <b>Rav Yehuda says this</b> is what <b>he is saying: Initially</b> the Sages <b>would say</b> that <b>gatherers</b> of the produce <b>of</b> the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year, i.e., those who gather a large quantity of produce of the Sabbatical Year for themselves, <b>are fit</b> to bear witness, but <b>merchants</b> who trade in the produce of the Sabbatical Year are <b>disqualified.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Once those who would offer money to the poor</b> to gather produce for them <b>grew abundant, and the poor would go and gather</b> the produce <b>for</b> those who hired them <b>and bring</b> it to them, then gathering a large amount of produce of the Sabbatical Year was considered a business. The Sages <b>then said</b> that <b>both this</b> category, gatherers of the produce of the Sabbatical Year, <b>and that</b> category, merchants who trade in the produce of the Sabbatical Year, are <b>disqualified.</b>

### Part 6
<b>The children of</b> the Sage <b>Raḥava had a difficulty with this</b> explanation, as accordingly <b>this</b> phrase: <b>Once the tax collectors grew abundant,</b> is inaccurate; the mishna <b>should have</b> stated: <b>Once the merchants grew abundant.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Shimon’s statement should be explained differently, as follows: <b>Initially</b> the Sages <b>would say</b> that <b>both this</b> category, gatherers of the produce of the Sabbatical Year, <b>and that</b> category, merchants who trade in the produce of the Sabbatical Year, are <b>disqualified. Once the tax collectors grew abundant</b> it was permitted to gather the produce of the Sabbatical Year. <b>And what</b> tax did <b>they</b> collect? <b><i>Arnona</i>,</b> which was a heavy tax on property collected both during the Sabbatical Year and in other years, placing pressure on those observing the Sabbatical Year. <b>As Rabbi Yannai proclaimed: Go out and sow</b> the fields <b>during the Sabbatical</b> Year <b>due to</b> the <b><i>arnona</i></b> that you must pay. Once this happened, the Sages <b>then said: Gatherers</b> of the produce of the Sabbatical Year <b>are fit</b> to bear witness, as they were no longer viewed as transgressors, but <b>merchants</b> who trade in this produce <b>are</b> still <b>disqualified.</b>

### Part 8
§ The Gemara recounts an incident connected tangentially to the discussion concerning the Sabbatical Year: <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Zarnokei and Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak were going to intercalate the year in Asya,</b> as circumstances did not enable them to perform the intercalation of the year in Eretz Yisrael. <b>Reish Lakish met them</b> and <b>joined with them. He said: I will go see how they do the deed,</b> i.e., how the intercalation is performed practically.

### Part 9
Reish Lakish <b>saw a certain man plowing</b> a field. <b>He said to</b> the other Sages: Look at this <b>priest</b> who is <b>plowing</b> during the Sabbatical Year. <b>They said to him</b> that he <b>could say</b> in his own defense: <b>I am a hired worker [<i>agiston</i>] in</b> the field, which belongs to a gentile. Therefore, it is permitted.

### Part 10
Reish Lakish <b>further saw a certain man pruning</b> vines <b>in</b> the <b>vineyards. He said to</b> the other Sages: Look at this <b>priest</b> who is <b>pruning</b> vines during the Sabbatical Year. <b>They said to him</b> that he <b>could say: I need</b> the branches <b>to</b> make <b>a bale [<i>ekel</i> ]</b> for my <b>olive press,</b> i.e., a basket to hold olives for pressing. Since he is not pruning the vines for agricultural purposes but to use the branches, it is permitted for him to do so in the Sabbatical Year. Reish Lakish <b>said to them,</b> in a play on words: <b>The heart knows whether</b> he is doing so <b>for a bale [<i>ekel</i> ], or</b> whether he is saying this <b>as deceit [<i>la’akalkalot</i>].</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>Which did he say to them first?</b> Which incident occurred first? <b>If we say</b> that <b>first he said to them that first</b> exclamation, that a priest was plowing the field, <b>let them say</b> to him in <b>this</b> latter incident <b>too,</b> in which someone was pruning vines, that he could claim in his defense: <b>I am a hired worker in</b> the field. This would have been a better justification than claiming he needed the branches. <b>Rather,</b> apparently <b>first he said to them this</b> exclamation, that a priest was pruning vines, <b>and</b> only <b>then he said to them that</b> a priest was plowing the field.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>a priest?</b> Why did Reish Lakish assume the man was a priest? The Gemara answers: It is <b>because</b> priests <b>are suspected of</b> desecrating the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year.

### Part 13
<b>As we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A <i>se’a</i> of <i>teruma</i>,</b> the portion of the produce designated for the priest, <b>that fell into a hundred <i>se’a</i> of Sabbatical</b> Year produce and was indistinguishable, <b>is nullified,</b> i.e., it no longer has the status of <i>teruma</i>, and can be eaten until the time that Sabbatical Year produce must be removed from one’s possession. If it fell into <b>a lesser</b> quantity of Sabbatical Year produce, the entire mixture <b>must</b> be left to <b>rot,</b> as it is prohibited for non-priests to partake of <i>teruma</i>.

### Part 14
<b>And we discussed it: Why must</b> the produce <b>rot? Let</b> its owner <b>sell it to a priest in accordance with</b> its <b>value as <i>teruma</i>,</b> which is less expensive than regular produce because it can be eaten only by priests, and <b>except for the value of that <i>se’a</i></b> of <i>teruma</i> that fell in, which the owner is required to give to a priest for free. The priest may then partake of the produce, treating the entire mixture as though it has the sanctity of <i>teruma</i>, and both the priest and the owner will benefit.

### Part 15
<b>And Rav Ḥiyya said in the name of Ulla: That is to say,</b> i.e., one can infer from the fact that one is not permitted to sell the mixture to a priest, that <b>priests are suspected of</b> desecrating <b>the Sabbatical</b> Year by partaking of its produce after the time it must be removed from one’s possession. They did so because they considered it theirs, the same as <i>teruma</i>, as both mitzvot pertain to the produce of Eretz Yisrael. Therefore, produce of the Sabbatical Year should not be given or sold to priests. Similarly, Reish Lakish assumed that those who desecrated the Sabbatical Year were priests.

### Part 16
After Reish Lakish continually bothered them with his comments, Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Zarnokei and Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak <b>said: This one is a nuisance.</b> In order to rid themselves of him, <b>when they reached</b> the location where they intended to intercalate the year, <b>they went up to the roof</b> and <b>took the ladder out from under them</b> so that he would stay below and would not be able to join them.

### Part 17
Sometime later, Reish Lakish <b>came before Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b> Reish Lakish <b>said to him:</b> Are <b>people who are suspected of</b> desecrating <b>the Sabbatical</b> Year <b>fit to intercalate the year?</b> He believed that the two Sages who were sent to intercalate the year treated the sanctity of the Sabbatical Year with disrespect.

### Part 18
Reish Lakish <b>then said</b> in response to his own question: This is <b>not difficult for me; just as</b> the Sages once intercalated the year in accordance with the assessment of <b>three cattle herders</b> (see 18b), which was permitted, as <b>the Sages depended</b> not on the assessment of the cattle herders but <b>on their</b> own <b>calculation,</b> perhaps here too the Sages depended on their own calculations and not on the decision of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Zarnokei and Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak.

### Part 19
Reish Lakish changed his mind <b>and then said: It is not similar. There,</b> in the case of the cattle herders, <b>afterward the Sages were counted,</b> i.e., they made a decision, <b>and intercalated that year</b> themselves. <b>Here,</b> by contrast, <b>it is a conspiracy of wicked people,</b> as the Sages who intercalated the year are disqualified from doing so; <b>and a conspiracy of wicked people is not counted. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This</b> problem you raise <b>is troublesome.</b>

### Part 20
<b>When</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Zarnokei and Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak subsequently <b>came before Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> after hearing about his discussion with Reish Lakish, <b>they said to him</b> bitterly: Reish Lakish <b>referred to us as cattle herders, and the Master said nothing to him</b> in response? Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to them</b> dismissively: <b>And</b> even <b>if he had referred to you as shepherds,</b> who are disqualified from bearing witness in addition to being disqualified from serving as judges, <b>what should I have said to him?</b> He is correct.

### Part 21
§ The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the source of the <i>halakha</i> that <b>a conspiracy of wicked people</b> is not counted as part of a group? The Gemara answers: <b>Shebna,</b> a steward and a minister in King Hezekiah’s court, was a prominent and influential figure. <b>He would teach</b> Torah <b>to</b> an audience of <b>130,000</b> followers, whereas King <b>Hezekiah would teach</b> Torah <b>to</b> an audience of merely <b>110,000</b> followers.

### Part 22
<b>When Sennacherib came and besieged Jerusalem, Shebna wrote a note and shot</b> it over the wall <b>with an arrow.</b> It read: <b>Shebna and his camp have appeased</b> Sennacherib and are ready to surrender; <b>Hezekiah and his camp have not appeased</b> Sennacherib. <b>As it is stated</b> in allusion to this incident: <b>“For behold, the wicked bend the bow, they have made ready their arrow upon the string”</b> (Psalms 11:2).

### Part 23
<b>Hezekiah was afraid. He said: Perhaps, God forbid, the opinion of the Holy One, Blessed be He, will follow the majority;</b> and <b>since the majority have submitted</b> to the Assyrians, even <b>those</b> who have not submitted <b>will also be submitted</b> into their hands. <b>The prophet</b> Isaiah then <b>came and said to him: “Say not: A conspiracy, concerning all of which this people say: A conspiracy”</b> (Isaiah 8:12). <b>Meaning, it is a conspiracy of wicked people, and a conspiracy of wicked people is not counted.</b> Therefore, although they are many, they are not considered the majority.

### Part 24
Shebna <b>went to carve out a grave for himself among the graves of the house of David,</b> as he thought that the kingship would be given to him. <b>The prophet</b> Isaiah then <b>came and said to him: “What have you here, and whom have you here, that you have carved out a grave for yourself here?</b> You, who have carved yourself out a grave on high, and hollowed a habitation for yourself in the rock? <b>Behold, the Lord will make you wander like the wandering of a man;</b> and he will wind you round and round” (Isaiah 22:16–17).

### Part 25
The Gemara mentions tangentially: <b>Rav says</b> that <b>the wandering of a man is more difficult than that of a woman.</b> He derives it from the expression “like the wandering of a man.”

### Part 26
With regard to the phrase: <b>“And he will wind you round and round,” Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says:</b> This <b>teaches that</b> Shebna <b>developed leprosy; it is written here: “And he will wind you round and round [<i>ve’otkha ato</i>],” and it is written there,</b> in the Torah, with regard to a leper: “And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be torn, and the hair of his head shall go loose, <b>and he shall cover his upper lip [<i>ya’te</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 13:45). The Hebrew word for upper lip is from the same root as the verb in the verse cited from Isaiah.

### Part 27
The Gemara continues to interpret the prophecy about Shebna: <b>“He will violently roll and toss you like a ball into a large country;</b> there you shall die, and there shall be the chariots of your glory, you shame of your lord’s house” (Isaiah 22:18). A <i>baraita</i> <b>taught: He,</b> Shebna, <b>desired shame for his master’s house; therefore his glory turned to shame.</b> This is what happened to him: <b>When he was going out</b> of the gate of Jerusalem to submit to the Assyrians, the angel <b>Gabriel came</b> and <b>held the gate in front of his camp</b> so they could not follow him. Consequently, he went out by himself.
