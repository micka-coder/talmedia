### Part 1
then if the judges <b>erred they should not</b> need to <b>pay</b> the party they wronged, as they can claim that they were prevented from examining the witnesses effectively. The Gemara answers: If that were to be the <i>halakha</i>, <b>all the more so that</b> this <b>would lock the door in the face of</b> potential <b>borrowers.</b> If people know that the courts are not responsible for an error in judgment, they will not be willing to lend money.

### Part 2
<b>Rava says:</b> The ruling of <b>the mishna here,</b> that cases of monetary law require inquiry and interrogation, is stated <b>with regard to laws of fines,</b> not standard cases of monetary law. <b>And the other</b> sources, i.e., the mishna in tractate <i>Shevi’it</i> and the <i>baraita</i>, which do not require inquiry and interrogation, are stated <b>with regard to</b> cases of <b>admissions and loans,</b> in which there is cause to relax the procedures of deliberation, as explained.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Pappa says: This and that,</b> i.e., both the mishna here and the other sources, are stated <b>with regard to</b> cases of <b>an admission and a loan.</b> The distinction between them is that the mishna <b>here,</b> which rules that cases of monetary law require inquiry and interrogation, is stated <b>with regard to</b> a possibly <b>fraudulent trial,</b> where the court suspects that one party is attempting to defraud the other party and have witnesses offer false testimony on his own behalf. <b>There,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> and in the mishna in tractate <i>Shevi’it</i>, which do not require inquiry and interrogation, the ruling is stated <b>with regard to a trial that</b> does <b>not</b> appear <b>fraudulent.</b>

### Part 4
This distinction is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Reish Lakish, as Reish Lakish raises a contradiction</b> between two verses: It <b>is written</b> in one verse: <b>“In justice shall you judge your neighbor”</b> (Leviticus 19:15), <b>and</b> it <b>is written</b> in another verse: <b>“Justice, justice, shall you follow”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:21), with the repetition indicating that it is not enough to merely judge with justice. He continues: <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? <b>Here,</b> this latter verse is stated <b>with regard to</b> a possibly <b>fraudulent trial,</b> where the court must take extra care to judge with justice; and <b>there,</b> that former verse is stated <b>with regard to a trial that</b> does <b>not</b> appear <b>fraudulent.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rav Ashi says:</b> The ruling of <b>the mishna here,</b> that cases of monetary law require inquiry and interrogation, is <b>as we answered,</b> i.e., in accordance with any one of the answers offered by the other <i>amora’im</i>. And those <b>verses</b> were not stated with regard to fraudulent trials; rather, <b>one</b> is stated <b>with regard to judgment,</b> in which the court must pursue justice extensively, <b>and one</b> is stated <b>with regard to compromise.</b>

### Part 6
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When the verse states: <b>“Justice, justice, shall you follow,” one</b> mention of “justice” is stated <b>with regard to judgment and one</b> is stated <b>with regard to compromise. How so?</b> Where there are <b>two boats traveling on the river and they encounter each other, if both of them</b> attempt to <b>pass, both of them sink,</b> as the river is not wide enough for both to pass. If they pass <b>one after the other, both of them pass. And similarly,</b> where there are <b>two camels who were ascending the ascent of Beit Ḥoron,</b> where there is a narrow steep path, <b>and they encounter each other, if both of them</b> attempt to <b>ascend, both of them fall.</b> If they ascend <b>one after the other, both of them ascend.</b>

### Part 7
<b>How</b> does one decide which of them should go first? If there is one boat that is <b>laden and</b> one boat <b>that is not laden,</b> the needs of the one <b>that is not laden should be overridden due to</b> the needs of the one <b>that is laden.</b> If there is one boat that is <b>close</b> to its destination <b>and</b> one boat <b>that is not close</b> to its destination, the needs of the one that is <b>close should be overridden due to</b> the needs of the one <b>that is not close.</b> If <b>both of them were close</b> to their destinations, or <b>both of them were far</b> from their destinations, <b>impose a compromise between them</b> to decide which goes first, <b>and</b> the owners of the boats <b>pay a fee to one other,</b> i.e., the owners of the first boat compensate the owner of the boat that waits, for any loss incurred.

### Part 8
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states: <b>“Justice, justice, shall you follow.”</b> This teaches that one should <b>follow the best,</b> most prestigious, <b>court</b> of the generation. For example, follow <b>after Rabbi Eliezer to Lod, after Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai to Beror Ḥayil.</b>

### Part 9
The Sages <b>taught:</b> When the gentile authorities issued decrees outlawing observance of the mitzvot, members of Jewish communities devised clandestine ways of indicating observance of mitzvot to each other. For example: If one produces <b>the sound of a millstone in</b> the city called <b>Burni,</b> this is tantamount to announcing: <b>Week of the son, week of the son,</b> i.e., there will be a circumcision. If one displays the <b>light of a lamp in</b> the city called <b>Beror Ḥayil,</b> this is tantamount to announcing: There is a wedding <b>feast there,</b> there is a wedding <b>feast there.</b>

### Part 10
<b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states: <b>“Justice, justice, shall you follow.”</b> This teaches that one should <b>follow the Sages to the academy</b> where they are found. For example, follow <b>after Rabbi Eliezer to Lod, after Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai to Beror Ḥayil, after Rabbi Yehoshua to Peki’in, after Rabban Gamliel to Yavne, after Rabbi Akiva to Bnei Brak, after Rabbi Matya to Rome [<i>Romi</i>], after Rabbi Ḥananya ben Teradyon to Sikhnei, after Rabbi Yosei to Tzippori, after Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira to Netzivin, after Rabbi Yehoshua to the exile [<i>gola</i>],</b> i.e., Babylonia, <b>after Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>to Beit She’arim,</b> and <b>after the Sages</b> in the time of the Temple <b>to the Chamber of Hewn Stone.</b>

### Part 11
§ The mishna teaches that in cases of <b>monetary law,</b> the court <b>opens</b> the deliberations either with a claim to exempt the accused, or with a claim to find him liable. In cases of capital law, the court opens the deliberations with a claim to acquit the accused, but does not open the deliberations with a claim to find him liable. The Gemara asks: <b>How do we say</b> this opening stage of the deliberations? In other words, with what claim does the court begin deliberating? <b>Rav Yehuda said: We say this to</b> the witnesses: <b>Who says</b> that the event occurred <b>as you said?</b> Perhaps you erred?

### Part 12
<b>Ulla said to him: But</b> by confronting the witnesses in this manner, <b>we silence them.</b> The witnesses will think that the court suspects them of lying, and they will not testify. Rav Yehuda said to him: <b>And let them be silenced. Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:1): <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Eliezer says:</b> In cases of capital law, the court <b>brings the witnesses from</b> one <b>place to</b> another <b>place in order to confuse them so that they will retract</b> their testimony if they are lying.

### Part 13
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>Are</b> the <i>halakhot</i> <b>comparable? There,</b> where Rabbi Shimon ben Eliezer says to bring the witnesses from place to place, the witnesses <b>are repressed by themselves,</b> whereas <b>here, we repress them by</b> direct <b>action,</b> and that the court should not do.

### Part 14
<b>Rather, Ulla says: We say this</b> to the accused: <b>Do you have witnesses to determine</b> that the witnesses who testified against you are <b>conspiring witnesses? Rabba said to him: But do we open</b> the deliberations <b>with</b> a claim to <b>acquit</b> the accused <b>that is</b> to <b>the liability of this</b> one, i.e., the witnesses? This claim can lead to the witnesses incurring liability for their testimony.

### Part 15
The Gemara questions Rabba’s assumption: <b>But is</b> this to <b>the liability of</b> the witnesses? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Makkot</i> 5b): <b>Conspiring witnesses are not killed</b> for their testimony <b>until the verdict</b> of the one concerning whom they testified <b>is issued?</b> Therefore, if they will be shown to be conspiring witnesses at this early stage of the proceedings, they will not be liable.

### Part 16
The Gemara restates Rabba’s objection: <b>This</b> is what <b>I say: If</b> the accused <b>would be silent until his verdict is issued and</b> then <b>brings witnesses and</b> the court <b>determines them</b> to be <b>conspiring</b> witnesses, it will be found that the statement of the court <b>is</b> to <b>the liability of this</b> one, i.e., the witnesses. <b>Rather, Rabba says: We say to</b> the accused: <b>Do you have witnesses to contradict them?</b> If the first witnesses are contradicted as to the facts of the case, no one is liable.

### Part 17
<b>Rav Kahana said:</b> We say to the witnesses: <b>Based on your statements, so-and-so is acquitted.</b> The court issues a <i>pro forma</i> declaration that it is possible to find a reason to acquit based on the testimony of the witnesses, and then they begin the deliberations. <b>Abaye and Rava both say: We say to</b> the accused: For example, <b>if you did not kill</b> anyone, <b>do not fear</b> the consequences of these proceedings, as you will be acquitted. <b>Rav Ashi says:</b> The court announces: <b>Whoever knows</b> of a reason <b>to acquit</b> the accused <b>should come and teach</b> this reason <b>concerning him.</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara comments: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the explanation <b>of Abaye and Rava. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The priest administering the <i>sota</i> rite to the <i>sota</i> says to her: <b>“If no man has lain with you and if you have not gone astray</b> to impurity while under your husband, you shall be free from this water of bitterness that causes the curse. But if you have gone astray while under your husband…” (Numbers 5:19–20). The priest first states the scenario in which the woman is innocent of adultery.
