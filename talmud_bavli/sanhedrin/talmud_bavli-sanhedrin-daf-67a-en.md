### Part 1
It is <b>merely a mnemonic.</b> The verse is not relevant to this <i>halakha</i>, and it is cited merely as a sign indicating that just as the <i>halakha</i> of a betrothed young woman pertains to her first act of sexual intercourse, so too, the <i>halakha</i> of the daughter of a priest who committed adultery pertains to a case where it is her first disqualification from the priesthood.

### Part 2
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to the case of <b>an inciter,</b> listed among those liable to be executed by stoning, <b>this is an ordinary person,</b> not a prophet. <b>And</b> it is referring to <b>one who incites an ordinary person</b> and not a multitude of people. What does the inciter do? <b>He says: There is an idol in such and such a place,</b> which <b>eats like this, drinks like this, does good</b> for its worshippers <b>like this,</b> and <b>harms</b> those who do not worship it <b>like this.</b>

### Part 3
The mishna states a principle with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of an inciter: With regard to <b>all of those</b> mentioned <b>in the Torah</b> who <b>are liable to</b> receive <b>the death</b> penalty, if there are no witnesses to their transgressions, the court <b>does not hide</b> witnesses in order <b>to</b> ensnare and punish <b>them, except for this</b> case of an inciter.

### Part 4
The mishna elaborates: If the inciter <b>said</b> his words of incitement <b>to two</b> men, <b>they are his witnesses, and</b> he does not need to be warned before the transgression; <b>they bring him to court and stone him.</b> If <b>he said</b> his words of incitement <b>to one</b> man alone, that man’s testimony would not be sufficient to have the inciter executed. Therefore <b>he says</b> to the inciter: <b>I have friends who are interested in this;</b> tell them too. This way there will be more witnesses.

### Part 5
The mishna continues: <b>If</b> the inciter <b>is cunning, and</b> he knows that <b>he cannot speak in front of</b> two men, the court <b>hides witnesses for him behind the fence</b> so that he will not see them, <b>and</b> the man whom the inciter had previously tried to incite <b>says to him: Say what you said</b> to me when we were <b>in seclusion. And the other</b> person, the inciter, <b>says to him</b> again that he should worship the idol. <b>And he says to</b> the inciter: <b>How can we forsake our God in Heaven and go and worship wood and stones? If</b> the inciter <b>retracts</b> his suggestion, <b>that is good. But if he says: This</b> idol worship <b>is our duty; this</b> is what <b>suits us,</b> then <b>those standing behind the fence bring him to court and have him stoned.</b>

### Part 6
The <i>halakha</i> of an inciter includes <b>one who says: I shall worship</b> idols, or one of the following statements: <b>I shall go and worship</b> idols, or: <b>let us go and worship</b> idols, or: <b>I shall sacrifice</b> an idolatrous offering, or: <b>I shall go and sacrifice</b> an idolatrous offering, or: <b>Let us go and sacrifice</b> an idolatrous offering, or: <b>I shall burn</b> incense as an idolatrous offering, or: <b>I shall go and burn</b> incense, or: <b>Let us go and burn</b> incense, or: <b>I shall pour</b> an idolatrous libation, or: <b>I shall go and pour</b> a libation, or: <b>Let us go and pour</b> a libation, or: <b>I shall bow</b> to an idol, or: <b>I shall go and bow,</b> or: <b>Let us go and bow.</b>

### Part 7
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches: With regard to the case of <b>an inciter, this is an ordinary person.</b> The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> he is executed by stoning is <b>that he is an ordinary person, but</b> if he is <b>a prophet</b> he is executed <b>by strangulation,</b> not by stoning. The mishna states further: <b>And</b> it is referring to <b>one who incites an ordinary person.</b> The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> he is executed by stoning is <b>that</b> he incited <b>an individual, but</b> if he subverted <b>a multitude</b> of people, he is executed <b>by strangulation.</b>

### Part 8
Consequently, <b>whose</b> opinion is expressed in <b>the mishna? It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A prophet who subverted</b> others to participate in idol worship is executed <b>by stoning. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> He is executed <b>by strangulation.</b> Likewise, <b>the subverters of an idolatrous city</b> are executed <b>by stoning. Rabbi Shimon says: By strangulation.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara challenges: <b>Say the last clause</b> of the mishna, i.e., say the following mishna: With regard to the case of <b>the subverter</b> listed among those liable to be executed by stoning, <b>this is one who says: Let us go and worship idols. And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> In this mishna the Sages <b>taught</b> the case of <b>the subverters of an idolatrous city.</b> Here <b>we arrive at</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who hold that those who incite a multitude of people are also executed by stoning. Is it possible that <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna expresses the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, and the last clause</b> expresses that of <b>the Rabbis?</b>

### Part 10
<b>Ravina says: The entire</b> mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, and</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> the mishna employing the style of: <b>Not</b> only <b>this</b> but <b>also that.</b> In other words, the mishna should be explained as follows: Not only is one who incites an individual executed by stoning, but even one who subverts an entire city is executed by stoning.

### Part 11
<b>Rav Pappa says: When</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> with regard to one who <b>incites</b> that <b>this is</b> referring to <b>an ordinary person,</b> it is not indicating that a prophet is not included in this <i>halakha</i>. Rather, it is referring <b>to</b> the <b>hiding</b> of witnesses behind a fence in order to ensnare the inciter, as his life is treated with contempt and derision, as though he were an ordinary person, i.e., a simpleton.

### Part 12
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all the rest of those liable to</b> receive the <b>death</b> penalty <b>by Torah</b> law, the court <b>does not hide</b> witnesses in order <b>to</b> ensnare <b>them</b> and punish them <b>except for this</b> case of an inciter.

### Part 13
<b>How</b> does the court <b>do</b> this <b>to him?</b> The agents of the court <b>light a candle for him in an inner room, and</b> they <b>place witnesses for him in an outer room</b> in the dark, <b>so that they can see him and hear his voice but he cannot see them. And the other</b> person, whom the inciter had previously tried to incite, <b>says to him: Say what you said to me</b> when we were <b>in seclusion. And he says to him</b> again that he should worship the idol. <b>And the other</b> person <b>says to him: How can we forsake our God in Heaven and worship idols? If</b> the inciter <b>retracts</b> his suggestion, <b>that is good. But if he says: This</b> idol worship <b>is our duty, and this</b> is what <b>suits us, the witnesses, who are listening from outside, bring him to court, and</b> they <b>have him stoned.</b>

### Part 14
<b>And</b> the court <b>did the same to</b> an inciter named <b>ben Setada, from</b> the city of <b>Lod, and they hanged him on Passover eve.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: Why did they call him <b>ben Setada,</b> when <b>he was the son of Pandeira? Rav Ḥisda says:</b> Perhaps his mother’s <b>husband,</b> who acted as his father, was named <b>Setada,</b> but his mother’s <b>paramour,</b> who fathered this <i>mamzer</i>, was named <b>Pandeira.</b> The Gemara challenges: But his mother’s <b>husband was Pappos ben Yehuda,</b> not Setada. <b>Rather,</b> perhaps <b>his mother</b> was named <b>Setada,</b> and he was named ben Setada after her. The Gemara challenges: But <b>his mother was Miriam, who braided women’s hair.</b> The Gemara explains: That is not a contradiction; Setada was merely a nickname, <b>as they say in Pumbedita: This one strayed [<i>setat da</i>] from her husband.</b>

### Part 16
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to the case of <b>the subverter</b> listed among those liable to be executed by stoning, <b>this is one who says</b> to a multitude of people: <b>Let us go and worship idols.</b>

### Part 17
<b>The warlock</b> is also liable to be executed by stoning. <b>One who performs</b> a real <b>act</b> of sorcery <b>is liable, but not one who deceives the eyes,</b> making it appear as though he is performing sorcery, as that is not considered sorcery. <b>Rabbi Akiva says in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua:</b> For example, <b>two</b> people can each <b>gather cucumbers</b> by sorcery. <b>One</b> of them <b>gathers</b> cucumbers and he is <b>exempt, and</b> the other <b>one gathers</b> cucumbers and he is <b>liable.</b> How so? <b>The one who performs</b> a real <b>act</b> of sorcery is <b>liable,</b> and <b>the one who deceives the eyes is exempt.</b>

### Part 18
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the case of subverters mentioned in the mishna, <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The Sages <b>taught here</b> the case of <b>the subverters of an idolatrous city.</b> Accordingly, there is no halakhic difference between one who incites individuals to idolatry and one who subverts an entire city; both are liable to be executed by stoning.

### Part 19
The mishna teaches that the case of <b>the warlock is</b> referring to <b>one who performs</b> a real <b>act</b> of sorcery. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse: <b>“You shall not allow a witch to live”</b> (Exodus 22:17), does not refer only to a female who practices sorcery; <b>both a man and a woman</b> are included. <b>If so, why</b> does <b>verse state “a witch”?</b> This is <b>because most women are familiar with witchcraft.</b>

### Part 20
<b>In what</b> manner is <b>their death</b> sentence administered? <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: It is stated here: “You shall not allow a witch to live,” and it is stated there,</b> with regard to the conquest of the Canaanites: <b>“You shall allow nothing that breathes to live”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:16). <b>Just as there,</b> the Canaanites were to be killed <b>by</b> the <b>sword</b> (see Numbers 21:24), <b>so too here,</b> the execution of a witch is administered <b>by</b> the <b>sword.</b>

### Part 21
<b>Rabbi Akiva says: It is stated here: “You shall not allow a witch to live,” and it is stated there,</b> with regard to Mount Sinai: “No hand shall touch it, for he shall be stoned, or thrown down; <b>whether it be animal or man, it shall not live”</b> (Exodus 19:13). <b>Just as there,</b> the verse speaks <b>of stoning, so too here,</b> a witch is executed <b>by stoning.</b>

### Part 22
<b>Rabbi Yosei</b> HaGelili <b>said to him: I derived</b> the meaning of the verse <b>“You shall not allow</b> a witch <b>to live” from</b> the verse <b>“You shall allow nothing</b> that breathes <b>to live”</b> via a verbal analogy between two similar phrases, <b>but you derived</b> the meaning of the verse <b>“You shall not allow</b> a witch <b>to live” from</b> the verse <b>“It shall not live,”</b> which is a less similar phrase.

### Part 23
<b>Rabbi Akiva said to him: I derived</b> a <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>Jews from</b> a <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>Jews, with regard to whom the verse included many</b> types of <b>death</b> penalties. Therefore, the fact that the expression “It shall not live” refers to stoning when stated with regard to Jews is especially significant. <b>But you derived</b> a <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>Jews from</b> a <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>gentiles, with regard to whom the verse included only</b>
