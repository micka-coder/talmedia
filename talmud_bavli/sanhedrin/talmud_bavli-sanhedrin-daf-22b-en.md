<b>your youth”</b> (Proverbs 5:18). Rav Yitzḥak, his son, <b>said to him: Such as whom?</b> Rav Yehuda <b>said to him: Such as your mother.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara wonders: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rav Yehuda</b> once <b>read to Rav Yitzḥak, his son,</b> from the verse: <b>“And I find more bitter than death the woman whose</b> heart <b>is snares and nets”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:26)? <b>And</b> Rav Yitzḥak <b>said to him: Such as whom? And</b> Rav Yehuda <b>said to him: Such as your mother.</b> The Gemara responds: This is not a contradiction. Granted, <b>she is difficult</b> and angry, but afterward she <b>is conciliatory,</b> so she is both more bitter than death and a source of calmness and joy for him, at different times.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Shmuel bar Unya says in the name of Rav: A woman is raw material,</b> like a vessel that has not been completed, <b>and makes a covenant,</b> becoming truly connected, <b>only to the one who made her a vessel</b> through her first act of sexual intercourse, <b>as it is stated: “For your Maker is your husband, the Lord of hosts is His name”</b> (Isaiah 54:5).

### Part 4
It is <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A man dies only to his wife,</b> i.e., it is primarily she who suffers the pain and sadness resulting from his death, <b>and a woman dies only to her husband. A man dies only to his wife, as it is stated: “And Elimelech, Naomi’s husband, died”</b> (Ruth 1:3), <b>and a woman dies only to her husband, as it is stated</b> in Jacob’s parting words to Joseph: <b>“And as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died on me”</b> (Genesis 48:7).

### Part 5
§ The mishna teaches: <b>One may not see</b> the king when he is having his hair cut. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A king has his hair cut every day. A High Priest</b> waits <b>from the eve of Shabbat to the eve of Shabbat</b> between haircuts. <b>An ordinary priest</b> has his hair cut <b>once every thirty days.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara explains: <b>A king has his hair cut every day, as it is stated: “Your eyes should see the king in his beauty”</b> (Isaiah 33:17), so his beauty must be tended to daily. <b>A High Priest</b> waits <b>from the eve of Shabbat</b> to the eve of Shabbat, as <b>Rav Shmuel bar Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Since new</b> priestly <b>watches begin</b> every week on the eve of Shabbat, the High Priest must have his hair cut in order to look his best when the new watch arrives.

### Part 7
The Gemara continues its explanation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>An ordinary priest</b> has his hair cut <b>once every thirty days, as it is written</b> with regard to the priests: <b>“They shall not shave their heads, and long hair they shall not grow out; they shall trim only their heads”</b> (Ezekiel 44:20), <b>and derive</b> by verbal analogy <b>“long hair”</b> in this verse <b>from “long hair”</b> in the verse written with regard to the <b>nazirite. It is written here,</b> with regard to the priests: <b>“And long hair they shall not grow out,” and it is written there,</b> with regard to the nazirite: <b>“Long hair growing on his head”</b> (Numbers 6:5). <b>Just as there,</b> nazirite hair growth is at least <b>thirty</b> days, <b>so too here, it is thirty</b> days, and the priest must cut his hair before it is called long. <b>And we also learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Nazir</i> 5a): A term of <b>naziriteship</b> of <b>unspecified</b> length is <b>thirty days.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>And there,</b> in the verse about the nazirite, <b>from where do we</b> derive that thirty days is the minimum length of a term? <b>Rav Mattana says: As the verse states: “He shall be [<i>yihye</i>] holy”</b> (Numbers 6:5): The word “<i>yihye</i>” <b>has the numerical value of thirty.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: Say</b> that the priests <b>should not grow</b> their hair <b>at all,</b> but shave their heads instead. Abaye <b>said to him: Had it been written: They shall not grow long hair,</b> it would be <b>as you said,</b> but <b>now that it is written: “And long hair”</b> (Ezekiel 44:20), it <b>can be</b> somewhat <b>long hair,</b> but <b>they should not grow it out</b> very long.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> that the restriction on priests growing long hair is a mitzva by Torah law and not just a regulation for its time, <b>now too,</b> after the destruction of the Temple, priests should be required to have their hair cut every thirty days. The Gemara responds: The prohibition against priests growing long hair <b>is similar to</b> the prohibition against their drinking <b>wine. Just as</b> with regard to <b>wine,</b> only <b>at</b> the <b>time of</b> their <b>entering</b> the Temple <b>is it forbidden</b> to the priests, but <b>when it is not</b> the <b>time of</b> their <b>entering</b> the Temple it is <b>permitted, so too,</b> with regard to <b>those with long hair, at</b> the <b>time of</b> their <b>entering</b> the Temple, growing their hair long is <b>prohibited,</b> but <b>when</b> it is <b>not</b> the <b>time of</b> their <b>entering</b> the Temple, it is <b>permitted.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara challenges this comparison: <b>And</b> is <b>wine permitted when</b> it is <b>not</b> the <b>time of</b> their <b>entering</b> the Temple? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: I say</b> that actually, it is <b>always prohibited</b> for <b>priests to drink wine,</b> even since the destruction of the Temple, <b>but what can I do, as his repair is his ruin,</b> meaning that it is the same destruction of the Temple that ruined and confused all priestly regulations and that also improved priests’ lifestyle by enabling them to drink. <b>And Abaye said: In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>do priests drink wine nowadays? In accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. The Gemara concludes <b>by inference that</b> if Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi is singled out as a lone opinion, then <b>the Rabbis prohibit</b> it.

### Part 12
The Gemara responds: <b>There,</b> with regard to drinking wine, <b>this is the reason</b> for the prohibition: <b>The Temple will speedily be built, and we need a priest who is fit for the</b> Temple <b>service; and</b> if the priests drink wine <b>there are none.</b> Therefore, none of them may drink wine. The Gemara objects: If so, <b>here too,</b> with regard to growing hair long, <b>I need a priest who is fit for</b> performing <b>the</b> Temple <b>service</b> as soon as the Temple is rebuilt, <b>and</b> if the priests grow their hair long, <b>there are none.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara responds: <b>Here it is possible for him to cut his hair and enter</b> the Temple immediately. The Gemara objects: <b>There too, it is possible for him to sleep a little and go in, as Rav Aḥa says:</b> Walking <b>the distance of a <i>mil</i> or sleeping</b> even <b>a minimal amount</b> will <b>dispel the</b> effect of <b>wine</b> that one has drunk. The Gemara responds: <b>But wasn’t it stated with regard to</b> Rav Aḥa’s statement: <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says: They taught</b> that the wine’s effect is dispelled in such a way <b>only when he drank a quarter-</b><i>log</i>, at most, <b>but</b> if he drank <b>more than a quarter-</b><i>log</i>, <b>all the more so that</b> walking that <b>distance disturbs him and sleep makes him</b> more <b>drunk,</b> unless he sleeps for a long time.

### Part 14
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The difference between drinking wine and growing hair is this: Concerning priests <b>drunk on wine, who desecrate</b> the Temple <b>service</b> when they perform it while intoxicated, <b>the Sages decreed about them</b> not to drink even after the Temple was destroyed. With regard to <b>long-haired</b> priests, <b>who do not desecrate</b> Temple <b>service</b> by performing it with hair that is too long, <b>the Sages did not decree about them</b> not to grow their hair long after the Temple was destroyed.

### Part 15
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rav Ashi’s distinction from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Karetot</i> 1:2): <b>And these are</b> they <b>who are</b> sentenced <b>to death</b> at the hand of Heaven: Priests who enter the Temple <b>with long hair or drunk on wine.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara comments: <b>Granted,</b> priests entering the Temple <b>drunk on wine</b> are liable for death, <b>as it is written: “Drink no wine nor strong drink, you, nor your sons with you,</b> when you go into the Tent of Meeting, <b>that you not die;</b> it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations” (Leviticus 10:9). <b>But</b> as for priests <b>with long hair, from where do we</b> derive that they are punished with death at the hand of Heaven?

### Part 17
The Gemara responds: It is from the fact <b>that</b> priests <b>drunk on wine were juxtaposed to those with long hair. It is written: “They shall not shave their heads, and long hair they shall not grow out”</b> (Ezekiel 44:20), <b>and it is written</b> in the next verse: <b>“Neither shall any priest drink wine</b> when they enter the inner court” (Ezekiel 44:21). <b>Just as</b> priests <b>drunk on wine</b> are liable <b>to</b> receive <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven, <b>so too, those with long hair</b> are liable <b>to</b> receive <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven.

### Part 18
<b>And</b> if so, <b>from this</b> very juxtaposition one may learn that <b>just as</b> priests <b>drunk on wine desecrate the</b> Temple <b>service, so too, those with long hair desecrate the</b> Temple <b>service,</b> which poses a difficulty for Rav Ashi’s statement. The Gemara acknowledges: This poses <b>a difficulty.</b>

### Part 19
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: This</b> <i>halakha</i>, <b>until Ezekiel came</b> and taught it, <b>who said it?</b> How can a <i>halakha</i> by Torah law be derived from the juxtaposition of verses in Ezekiel? Rav Ashi responds: <b>And according to your reasoning,</b> then, with regard to <b>this</b> statement <b>that Rav Ḥisda says: We did not learn this</b> following <b>matter from the Torah of Moses, our teacher, until Ezekiel came and taught</b> it to <b>us: “No stranger, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into My Sanctuary to serve Me”</b> (Ezekiel 44:9), <b>until Ezekiel came</b> and taught it, <b>who said it? Rather,</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>is learned as a tradition</b> and therefore was observed for generations, <b>and Ezekiel came and gave it support by</b> writing <b>a verse. Here too,</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>is learned as a tradition, and Ezekiel came and gave it support by</b> writing <b>a verse.</b>

### Part 20
The Gemara comments: <b>And when they learned</b> this <b><i>halakha</i>,</b> it was to teach that a priest who violates the restriction is liable <b>to</b> receive <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven. But the fact <b>that</b> it is considered <b>desecration of the</b> Temple <b>service is not learned</b> as a tradition.

### Part 21
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>“they shall trim only their heads”</b> (Ezekiel 44:20)? The Sages <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Like a <i>lulyanit</i> haircut.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is <b>a <i>lulyanit</i> haircut? Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: A unique haircut.</b> The Gemara asks again: <b>What is it like? Rav Ashi says:</b> The hair is cut so that <b>the head of</b> the hair in <b>this</b> row is <b>at the side of the bottom of that</b> row.

### Part 22
The Sages <b>asked Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: <b>What was the haircut of the High Priest? He said to them: Go out and see the haircut of ben Elasa,</b> who was the son-in-law of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, and who sported the High Priest’s hairstyle. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: Not for nothing did ben Elasa disburse his money</b> on his haircuts, <b>but in order to demonstrate</b> on himself <b>the haircut of the High Priest.</b>
