### Part 1
<b>who was not conceived in sanctity,</b> as his parents were still gentiles, <b>but his birth was in sanctity,</b> as his mother converted before his birth, <b>he has maternal kinship,</b> i.e., his relationship to his mother’s relatives is recognized, <b>but he does not have paternal kinship.</b>

### Part 2
<b>How so?</b> If <b>he married his maternal half sister,</b> who was born before him and converted, <b>he must divorce</b> her. Although by Torah law they are considered unrelated, as a convert is considered to be reborn and all his previous family relationships are disregarded according to <i>halakha</i>, the Sages prohibited their marriage, lest he think that as a Jew it is permitted for him to engage in behaviors that were previously forbidden to him. If she is his <b>paternal</b> half sister, <b>he may maintain</b> her as his wife, as it is permitted for a gentile to marry his paternal half sister. If he married his <b>father’s maternal half sister, he must divorce her.</b> If he married his father’s <b>paternal</b> half sister, <b>he may maintain</b> her as his wife.

### Part 3
If she is his <b>mother’s maternal half sister, he must divorce</b> her. If she is his <b>mother’s paternal half sister, Rabbi Meir says he must divorce</b> her, <b>and the Rabbis say he may maintain</b> her as his wife. <b>As Rabbi Meir would say:</b> With regard to <b>any forbidden relative who is</b> forbidden <b>due to maternal kinship,</b> whether the woman is his paternal relative, e.g., his father’s maternal half sister, or his maternal relative, <b>he must divorce</b> her; whereas if she is forbidden <b>due to paternal kinship, he may maintain</b> her as his wife.

### Part 4
<b>And</b> according to all opinions, he is <b>permitted to</b> marry <b>his brother’s wife and his father’s brother’s wife, and all other</b> relatives <b>with whom relations are forbidden</b> in the case of born Jew <b>are</b> also <b>permitted to him.</b> The expression: And all other relatives with whom relations are forbidden, is added <b>to include his father’s wife,</b> who is permitted to him if she was widowed or divorced from his father.

### Part 5
With regard to a gentile who <b>married a woman and her daughter</b> and they all converted, <b>he may marry one but must divorce</b> the other <b>one; and he should not marry</b> the second of them <b><i>ab initio</i>.</b> If <b>his wife,</b> the daughter, <b>died,</b> he is <b>permitted to</b> maintain <b>his mother-in-law</b> as his wife. <b>And some say</b> that he is <b>prohibited from</b> maintaining <b>his mother-in-law.</b> In any event, Rabbi Meir clearly holds that several forbidden relationships for which a Jew is not liable to receive capital punishment, but only <i>karet</i>, are forbidden to descendants of Noah as well, namely, intercourse with one’s sister or one’s parent’s sister.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> This is <b>not difficult; this</b> <i>baraita</i> cites the statement of <b>Rabbi Meir according to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer, and that</b> previously mentioned <i>baraita</i> cites the statement of <b>Rabbi Meir according to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Akiva.</b>

### Part 7
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother,</b> and shall cleave to his wife, and they shall be one flesh” (Genesis 2:24), that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: “His father”</b> is referring to <b>his father’s sister,</b> i.e., one must abandon the possibility of marrying his father’s sister and marry someone else. <b>“His mother”</b> is referring to <b>his mother’s sister. Rabbi Akiva says: “His father”</b> is referring to <b>his father’s wife; “his mother”</b> is referring to <b>his mother, literally.</b>

### Part 8
<b>“And shall cleave</b> to his wife,” <b>but not to a male;</b> such a relationship is not defined as cleaving. <b>“To his wife,” but not to the wife of another</b> man. <b>“And they shall be one flesh”</b> indicates that he should marry one of <b>those</b> with <b>whom</b> he can <b>become one flesh,</b> i.e., they can bear children together. This <b>excludes domesticated and undomesticated animals,</b> with which one is prohibited from engaging in bestiality, <b>as they do not become one flesh.</b> All these are forbidden to the descendants of Noah.

### Part 9
§ <b>The Master said</b> in this <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: “His father”</b> is referring to <b>his father’s sister.</b> The Gemara asks: Why not <b>say</b> that it is referring to <b>his father, literally,</b> prohibiting homosexual intercourse with one’s father? The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> prohibition <b>is</b> derived from another phrase in the verse: <b>“And shall cleave</b> to his wife,” <b>but not to a male;</b> this includes his father.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: Why not <b>say</b> that “his father” is referring to <b>his father’s wife?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> prohibition <b>is</b> derived from the term <b>“to his wife,” but not to the wife of another</b> man. The Gemara asks: Why not <b>say</b> that it is referring to his father’s wife <b>after</b> his father’s <b>death,</b> when she is no longer a married woman? The Gemara answers: The term “his father” is interpreted in a way that is <b>similar to</b> the interpretation of the term <b>“his mother.” Just as his mother is not</b> forbidden due to her <b>marriage</b> to his father, but rather due to her relationship to him, <b>so too,</b> the term <b>“his father”</b> is <b>not</b> referring to a relative who is forbidden to him due to her <b>marriage.</b>

### Part 11
Rabbi Eliezer says that <b>“his mother”</b> is referring to <b>his mother’s sister.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that it is referring to <b>his mother, literally?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> prohibition <b>is</b> derived from the term <b>“to his wife,” but not to the wife of another</b> man; and his mother is his father’s wife. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that it is referring to his mother <b>after</b> his father’s <b>death,</b> when she is no longer married? The Gemara answers: The term “his mother” is interpreted in a way that is <b>similar to</b> the interpretation of the term <b>“his father.” Just as</b> the term <b>“his father” is not</b> interpreted <b>literally, so too,</b> the term <b>“his mother” is not</b> interpreted <b>literally.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Rabbi Akiva says: “His father”</b> is referring to <b>his father’s wife.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> it is referring to <b>his father, literally?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> prohibition <b>is</b> derived from the term <b>“and shall cleave</b> to his wife,” <b>but not to a male.</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>If so,</b> the prohibition of <b>his father’s wife is also</b> derived from another term: <b>“To his wife,” but not to the wife of another</b> man. The Gemara explains: The term “to his wife” is referring to his father’s wife <b>after</b> his father’s <b>death,</b> when she is no longer married.

### Part 13
Rabbi Akiva says: <b>“His mother”</b> is referring to <b>his mother, literally.</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>That</b> prohibition <b>is</b> derived from the term <b>“to his wife,” but not to the wife of another</b> man. The Gemara explains: According to Rabbi Akiva, the term “his mother” is referring to <b>his mother whom</b> his father <b>raped,</b> i.e., she was never his father’s wife.

### Part 14
<b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do</b> Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Akiva <b>disagree? Rabbi Eliezer holds</b>
