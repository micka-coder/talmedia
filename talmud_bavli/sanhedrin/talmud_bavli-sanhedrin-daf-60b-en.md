### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who worships idols</b> is executed by stoning. This includes <b>one who worships</b> an idol, <b>and one who slaughters</b> an animal as an idolatrous offering, <b>and one who burns</b> incense as an idolatrous offering, <b>and one who pours a libation</b> in idol worship, <b>and one who bows</b> to an idol, <b>and one who</b> declares that he <b>accepts</b> an idol <b>upon himself as a god, and one who says to</b> an idol: <b>You are my god.</b>

### Part 2
<b>But</b> with regard to <b>one who hugs</b> an idol, <b>or one who kisses</b> it, <b>or one who cleans</b> it, <b>or one who sprays</b> water before it, <b>or one who washes</b> it, <b>or one who rubs</b> it with oil, <b>or one who dresses</b> it, <b>or one who puts its shoes on</b> it, he <b>transgresses a prohibition</b> but is not liable to receive capital punishment. With regard to <b>one who vows in</b> an idol’s <b>name and one who affirms</b> his statement by an oath <b>in its name,</b> he <b>transgresses a prohibition.</b>

### Part 3
<b>One who defecates before</b> the idol known as <b>Ba’al-Peor</b> is liable to receive capital punishment, even though defecating is a degrading act, as <b>that is its</b> form of <b>worship.</b> Likewise, <b>one who throws a stone at Mercury</b> is liable to receive capital punishment, as <b>that is its</b> form of <b>worship.</b>

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What</b> is added in the mishna by stating the phrase: <b>One who worships?</b> Since worship is the general description of all the actions detailed in the mishna, why is this phrase necessary?

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya says</b> that <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying: One who worships</b> an idol <b>in its</b> typical <b>manner</b> of worship is liable to be executed; <b>and</b> furthermore, <b>one who slaughters</b> an animal as an idolatrous offering, <b>and one who burns</b> incense, <b>and one who pours</b> a libation, <b>and the one who bows</b> to an idol are all liable to be executed, <b>and</b> this applies <b>even</b> if this manner of worship is <b>not</b> the idol’s typical <b>manner</b> of worship. Even if the idol in question is not typically worshipped in these ways, these specific acts are still considered idol worship because these are the ways in which God is worshipped in the Temple.

### Part 6
The Gemara suggests: <b>And let</b> the mishna <b>also count sprinkling</b> the blood of an offering, which is also one of the sacrificial rites in the Temple. <b>Abaye says: Sprinkling</b> the blood of an offering <b>is</b> the same as <b>pouring</b> a libation, since they are essentially one sacrificial rite, <b>as it is written: “I will not pour their libations of blood”</b> (Psalms 16:4), indicating that sprinkling the blood of an offering is also referred to as offering a libation.

### Part 7
§ The Gemara asks with regard to the <i>halakha</i> that one is liable for worshipping an idol in these manners even if they are not the way the idol is typically worshipped: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived?

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “One who sacrifices to the gods shall be utterly destroyed, except to the Lord alone” (Exodus 22:19): <b>If it were stated: One who sacrifices shall be utterly destroyed, I would have said</b> that <b>the verse speaks of one who slaughters a sacrificial</b> animal <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard, referring to a severe transgression that is stated elsewhere in the Torah. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “To the gods,”</b> indicating that <b>the verse speaks of one who slaughters</b> an offering <b>to an idol.</b>

### Part 9
The <i>baraita</i> asks: From here <b>I</b> know <b>only</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>one who slaughters</b> an offering to an idol. <b>From where</b> is it derived that one who <b>burns</b> incense <b>or pours</b> a libation is also liable to receive the death penalty? The <i>baraita</i> answers that <b>the verse states: “Except to the Lord alone”;</b> the verse <b>emptied out,</b> i.e., designated, <b>all the</b> sacrificial <b>rites to the ineffable name</b> of God, indicating that one who performs any of these rites in idol worship is liable.

### Part 10
The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>Since slaughter is singled out</b> from all of the forms of worship to be mentioned in this verse in order <b>to derive</b> from it that <b>with regard to</b> all the sacrificial <b>rites</b> performed <b>inside</b> the Temple, one who performs them in idol worship is liable to receive capital punishment, <b>from where</b> is it derived that this <i>halakha</i> <b>includes bowing</b> down to an idol, which is not a sacrificial rite?

### Part 11
The <i>baraita</i> answers that <b>the verse states: “And has gone and served other gods and bowed to them”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:3), <b>and</b> a verse <b>near it</b> states: <b>“Then you shall bring forth that man</b> or that woman who has done this evil thing to your gates, the man or the woman, and you shall stone them with stones and they shall die” (Deuteronomy 17:5). It is derived from the juxtaposition of these two verses that one who bows down to an idol is liable to be executed.

### Part 12
The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>We have heard</b> the <b>punishment</b> for bowing down to an idol, but <b>from where</b> is the <b>prohibition</b> against doing so derived? The <i>baraita</i> answers that <b>the verse states: “For you shall bow to no other god”</b> (Exodus 34:14).

### Part 13
One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I should include</b> among those liable to receive capital punishment <b>one who hugs</b> an idol, <b>or one who kisses</b> it, <b>or one who puts its shoes on</b> it as well. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “One who sacrifices</b> shall be utterly destroyed,” referring to the act of slaughtering an offering in idol worship.

### Part 14
The <i>baraita</i> explains: The <b>slaughter</b> of an offering <b>was included</b> in the general category of the prohibited forms of idol worship, <b>and why was it singled out</b> to be mentioned in this verse? It was singled out <b>to compare</b> a matter <b>to it and say to you: Just as slaughter is notable</b> in <b>that it is</b> a sacrificial <b>rite</b> performed <b>inside</b> the Temple, <b>and</b> those who perform this rite for the purpose of idol worship <b>are liable</b> to receive <b>the death penalty for it, so too, any</b> form of worship <b>that is</b> a sacrificial <b>rite</b> performed <b>inside</b> the Temple is prohibited when performed for idol worship, <b>and</b> transgressors <b>are liable</b> to receive <b>the death penalty for it.</b>

### Part 15
Therefore, the act of <b>bowing</b> to an idol <b>is singled out</b> to be mentioned in a separate verse <b>to derive</b> the death penalty for that action <b>itself,</b> despite the fact that it is not a sacrificial rite performed in the Temple, whereas the <b>slaughter</b> of an offering <b>is singled out</b> to be mentioned in order <b>to derive</b> from it the principle <b>with regard to the entire category,</b> namely, that generally one is not liable to receive capital punishment for a form of worship that is not performed in the Temple.

### Part 16
The Gemara proceeds to clarify the <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>I would have said</b> that <b>the verse speaks of one who slaughters a sacrificial</b> animal <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard. The Gemara asks: The punishment for <b>one who slaughters a sacrificial</b> animal <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard <b>is <i>karet</i>,</b> not capital punishment, as it is stated: “Each and every man…who offers a burnt-offering or sacrifice, and does not bring it to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting to sacrifice it to the Lord, even that man shall be cut off from his people” (Leviticus 17:8–9). Therefore, how can the <i>baraita</i> suggest that a verse that mentions capital punishment could be referring to this transgression?

### Part 17
The Gemara answers: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that in a case <b>when</b> the witnesses <b>warned</b> the transgressor not to slaughter the offering outside the Temple he is liable to receive <b>the death</b> penalty, but in a case <b>when they did not warn him</b> he is liable to receive <b><i>karet</i>.</b> Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that one who slaughters an offering outside the Temple is not liable to receive the death penalty even if he was warned.

### Part 18
The <i>baraita</i> states that the principle concerning the forms of idol worship that are punishable by execution is derived from the verse that mentions slaughtering an animal as an idolatrous offering, whereas bowing to an idol is mentioned in the verse as an exception. <b>Rava bar Rav Ḥanan said to Abaye: Say</b> that <b>bowing is singled out</b> to be mentioned <b>to teach, with regard to the entire category,</b> that any honorable form of worship, when performed for the sake of idol worship, carries the death penalty, not only sacrificial rites performed the Temple.

### Part 19
<b>And if you would say</b> that if so, <b>why do I</b> need <b>slaughter</b> to be mentioned in the verse specifically, one can say that mentioning slaughter is necessary <b>for</b> the matter of slaughter <b>itself,</b> i.e., to teach <b>that one can have intention from</b> one sacrificial <b>rite to</b> another sacrificial <b>rite.</b> In other words, slaughtering an animal with idolatrous intent is punishable by death even if the intention of the transgressor pertains not to the slaughter itself but to another part of the sacrificial process.

### Part 20
<b>As it was stated</b> that with regard to <b>one who slaughters an animal</b> in order <b>to sprinkle its blood in idol worship or to burn its fat in idol worship, Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b>
