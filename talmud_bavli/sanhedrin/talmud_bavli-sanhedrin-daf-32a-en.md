### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Both</b> cases of <b>monetary law and</b> cases of <b>capital law are equal with regard to</b> the requirement for <b>inquiry and interrogation</b> of the witnesses, <b>as it is stated: “You shall have one manner of law”</b> (Leviticus 24:22), meaning that all legal procedures must be uniform.

### Part 2
Having stated the essential similarity between the two, the mishna enumerates the differences between them. <b>What</b> are the differences <b>between</b> cases of <b>monetary law and</b> cases of <b>capital law?</b> Cases of <b>monetary law</b> are judged <b>by</b> a court of <b>three</b> judges, <b>and</b> cases of <b>capital law</b> are judged <b>by</b> a court of <b>twenty-three</b> judges. In cases of <b>monetary law,</b> the court <b>opens</b> the deliberations <b>either</b> with a claim <b>to exempt</b> the accused, <b>or</b> with a claim <b>to find</b> him <b>liable. And</b> in cases of <b>capital law,</b> the court <b>opens</b> the deliberations with a claim <b>to acquit</b> the accused, <b>but</b> it <b>does not open</b> the deliberations with a claim <b>to find</b> him <b>liable.</b>

### Part 3
In cases of <b>monetary law,</b> the court <b>directs,</b> i.e., issues, the ruling <b>based on</b> a majority of <b>one</b> judge, <b>either to exempt, or to find liable. But</b> in cases of <b>capital law,</b> the court <b>directs</b> the judgment <b>based on</b> a majority of <b>one</b> judge <b>to acquit and based on</b> a majority of <b>two</b> judges <b>to find liable.</b>

### Part 4
In cases of <b>monetary law,</b> the court <b>brings</b> the accused <b>back</b> to be judged again if new evidence arises, <b>either</b> with a claim <b>to exempt</b> the accused, <b>or</b> with a claim <b>to find</b> him <b>liable.</b> In cases of <b>capital law,</b> the court <b>brings</b> the accused <b>back</b> to be judged again with a claim <b>to acquit</b> him, <b>but</b> the court <b>does not bring</b> him back to be judged with a claim <b>to find</b> him <b>liable.</b>

### Part 5
In cases of <b>monetary law, all</b> those present at the trial <b>may teach</b> a reason to <b>exempt</b> a litigant <b>or</b> to find him <b>liable.</b> In cases of <b>capital law, all</b> those present at the trial <b>may teach</b> a reason to <b>acquit</b> the accused, <b>but not all</b> present <b>may teach</b> a reason to find him <b>liable.</b> Only the judges can teach a reason to find him liable.

### Part 6
In cases of <b>monetary law, one who</b> initially <b>teaches</b> a reason to find the accused <b>liable may</b> then <b>teach</b> a reason to <b>exempt</b> him, <b>and one who</b> initially <b>teaches</b> a reason to <b>exempt</b> him <b>may</b> then <b>teach</b> a reason to find him <b>liable.</b> In cases of <b>capital law, one who</b> initially <b>teaches</b> a reason to find him <b>liable may</b> then <b>teach</b> a reason to <b>acquit, but one who</b> initially <b>teaches</b> a reason to <b>acquit may not return and teach</b> a reason to find him <b>liable.</b>

### Part 7
In cases of <b>monetary law,</b> the court <b>judges during the daytime, and may conclude</b> the deliberations and issue the ruling even <b>at night.</b> In cases of <b>capital law,</b> the court <b>judges during the daytime, and concludes</b> the deliberations and issues the ruling only <b>in the daytime.</b>

### Part 8
In cases of <b>monetary law,</b> the court may <b>conclude</b> the deliberations and issue the ruling even <b>on that same day, whether to exempt</b> the accused <b>or to find</b> him <b>liable.</b> In cases of <b>capital law,</b> the court may <b>conclude</b> the deliberations and issue the ruling even <b>on that same day to acquit</b> the accused, but must wait until <b>the following day to</b> find him <b>liable. Therefore,</b> since capital cases might continue for two days, the court <b>does not judge</b> cases of capital law on certain days, <b>neither on the eve of Shabbat nor the eve of a Festival.</b>

### Part 9
In cases of <b>monetary law,</b> and likewise in <b>the</b> cases of <b>ritual impurity and purity,</b> the judges <b>commence</b> expressing their opinions <b>from the greatest</b> of the judges. In cases of <b>capital law,</b> the judges <b>commence</b> issuing their opinions <b>from the side,</b> where the least significant judges sit.

### Part 10
<b>All are fit to judge</b> cases of <b>monetary law. But not all are fit to judge</b> cases of <b>capital law; only priests, Levites, and Israelites who</b> are of sufficiently fit lineage to <b>marry</b> their daughters <b>to</b> members of <b>the priesthood</b> are fit to judge cases of capital law.

### Part 11
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that cases of monetary law require inquiry and interrogation of the witnesses. The Gemara asks: <b>Do we require inquiry and interrogation</b> in cases of <b>monetary law? And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Makkot</i> 1:2): With regard to a promissory <b>note whose date is written on the first of Nisan of the Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>and witnesses came and said</b> to the signatory witnesses: <b>How</b> is it that <b>you are testifying concerning this</b> promissory <b>note? But</b> is it <b>not</b> so that <b>on such and such day</b> on which the promissory note was written <b>you were with us in such and such place?</b> The promissory <b>note</b> is nevertheless <b>valid, and its witnesses</b> remain <b>fit</b> to bear witness. The reason they are not proven to have signed the promissory note falsely is that <b>we are concerned</b> that <b>perhaps they delayed and wrote it,</b> i.e., the loan was given on an earlier date, and the promissory note was postdated.

### Part 12
The Gemara explains the contradiction: <b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that <b>we require inquiry and interrogation</b> in cases of monetary law, <b>how are we concerned</b> that <b>perhaps they delayed and wrote it?</b> The signatory witnesses would be asked on which day they signed the promissory note, and when that does not accord with what is written in the promissory note, their testimony would be disregarded.

### Part 13
The Gemara counters: <b>And according to your reasoning</b> that we do not require inquiry and interrogation in cases of monetary law, <b>the mishna</b> elsewhere <b>should pose a difficulty for you</b> as well. As <i>mishnayot</i> are more authoritative than <i>baraitot</i>, it is preferable to raise a contradiction between two <i>mishnayot</i> than to raise a contradiction from a <i>baraita</i> to a mishna. The mishna teaches (<i>Shevi’it</i> 10:5): <b>Antedated promissory notes</b> are <b>not valid, but postdated</b> promissory notes are <b>valid. And if it enters your mind</b> to say <b>we require inquiry and interrogation</b> in cases of monetary law and that if there is a contradiction the testimony is not accepted, <b>why</b> are <b>postdated</b> promissory notes <b>valid?</b> The witnesses’ testimony does not accord with what is written in the document.

### Part 14
The Gemara explains: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult.</b> There is a reason why the contradiction was raised from the <i>baraita</i>, not from the mishna. <b>We are saying a better,</b> i.e., stronger, contradiction <b>than</b> the one from the mishna. As one sees in the <i>baraita</i> <b>that even</b> with regard to a promissory note written on the <b>first of Nisan</b> in the Sabbatical Year, <b>when</b> it is <b>not common</b> to find <b>people to lend</b> money, as all debts are canceled at the close of the Sabbatical Year, <b>where</b> it <b>is not</b> as reasonable <b>to say</b> that <b>perhaps they delayed and wrote</b> the promissory note, <b>as one would not damage his</b> promissory <b>note</b> by postdating it so close to the end of the Sabbatical Year; <b>even so, since</b> the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year <b>cancels</b> debts only at <b>its close,</b> we are concerned that the promissory note is postdated and <b>we deem</b> it <b>valid.</b> This is why the contradiction was raised from the <i>baraita</i>, not from the mishna.

### Part 15
The Gemara returns to its question: <b>In any case,</b> the contradiction between the mishna and the <i>baraita</i> is <b>difficult.</b> The Gemara presents <b>a mnemonic</b> device for the following discussion, with each letter representing the name of a Sage who suggests an answer: <b><i>Ḥet</i>, <i>reish</i>, <i>peh</i>, <i>shin</i>.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara cites the first answer. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says: By Torah law, both</b> cases of <b>monetary law and</b> cases of <b>capital law</b> are equal <b>with regard to inquiry and interrogation</b> of witnesses, <b>as it is stated: “You shall have one manner of law”</b> (Leviticus 24:22). <b>And what is the reason</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that in cases of <b>monetary law we do not need inquiry and interrogation?</b> It is an ordinance instituted by the Sages <b>so as not to lock the door in the face of</b> potential <b>borrowers.</b> The Sages were concerned that intensive examination of the witnesses would often result in contradictory testimony and render it difficult for lenders to collect their debts. This could lead to people refraining from lending money.

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so</b> that the Sages removed the requirement for inquiry and interrogation in cases of monetary law,
