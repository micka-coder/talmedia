### Part 1
<b>You must say</b> that <b>the severity of</b> the transgression of <b>the subverter</b> is greater. Since those who subverted the people of an idolatrous city are executed by stoning, this is evidently a more severe type of capital punishment than decapitation. <b>And</b> it is inferred <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> that <b>if</b> it is so that concerning <b>strangulation, which</b> is more <b>severe than</b> decapitation by the <b>sword,</b> nevertheless <b>burning</b> is more <b>severe than it,</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> obvious that burning is more severe than decapitation by the <b>sword, which is</b> a more <b>lenient</b> type of execution compared to strangulation?

### Part 2
<b>Stoning</b> is considered more <b>severe than strangulation, as it is meted out to one who blasphemes and to one who worships idols. And</b> for <b>what</b> reason is the <b>severity</b> of these transgressions considered greater? <b>As we said,</b> it is because the transgressors undermine the fundamental tenets of Judaism.

### Part 3
The Gemara raises an objection: <b>On the contrary; strangulation</b> is more <b>severe, as it is meted out to one who wounds his father or his mother. And</b> for <b>what</b> reason is the <b>severity</b> of this transgression considered greater? <b>Because</b> the honor of one’s parents <b>is compared</b> to the honor of the Omnipresent.

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: <b>Since the Merciful One singles out</b> the case of <b>the betrothed daughter of a non-priest</b> who committed adultery <b>from the category of a married Jewish woman</b> who committed adultery, changing her punishment <b>from</b> execution by <b>strangulation to</b> execution by <b>stoning, conclude from it</b> that <b>stoning</b> is more <b>severe.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Stoning</b> is considered more <b>severe than</b> decapitation by the <b>sword, as it is meted out to one who blasphemes</b> and to one who worships idols. The Gemara raises an objection: <b>On the contrary;</b> decapitation by the <b>sword</b> is more <b>severe, as it is meted out to the people of an idolatrous city. And</b> for <b>what</b> reason is the <b>severity</b> of this case considered greater? <b>Because their property is destroyed</b> as well.

### Part 6
The Gemara answers that in response to this objection <b>you</b> should <b>say: But the severity of which</b> transgression <b>is greater: The severity</b> of the transgression <b>of the subverter, or the severity</b> of the transgression <b>of the subverted? You must say</b> that <b>the severity</b> of the transgression <b>of the subverter</b> is greater. Since those who subverted the people of an idolatrous city are executed by stoning, this punishment is evidently more severe than decapitation. <b>And</b> it is inferred <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> that <b>if</b> it is so that concerning <b>strangulation, which</b> is more <b>severe than</b> decapitation by the <b>sword,</b> nevertheless <b>stoning is</b> more <b>severe than it,</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> obvious that stoning is more severe than decapitation by the <b>sword, which is</b> a more <b>lenient</b> type of execution compared to strangulation?

### Part 7
<b>Strangulation</b> is more <b>severe than</b> decapitation by the <b>sword, as it is meted out to one who wounds his father or his mother. And</b> for <b>what</b> reason is the <b>severity</b> of this transgression considered greater? <b>As we said,</b> because the honor of one’s parents is compared to the honor of the Omnipresent.

### Part 8
The Gemara raises an objection: <b>On the contrary;</b> decapitation by the <b>sword</b> is more <b>severe, as it is meted out to the people of an idolatrous city. And</b> for <b>what</b> reason is the <b>severity</b> of this transgression considered greater? <b>Because their property is destroyed</b> as well.

### Part 9
The Gemara answers that <b>you</b> should <b>say</b> in response to this objection: <b>But the severity of which</b> transgression <b>is greater: The severity</b> of the transgression <b>of the subverter, or the severity</b> of the transgression <b>of the subverted? You must say</b> that <b>the severity</b> of the transgression <b>of the subverter</b> is greater, <b>and it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The subverters of an idolatrous city</b> are executed <b>by stoning. Rabbi Shimon says: By strangulation.</b> Therefore, according to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, it is clear that strangulation is a more severe type of capital punishment than decapitation.

### Part 10
§ <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan was wont to say</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: A <b>betrothed young woman</b> who is <b>the daughter of a priest</b> and <b>who committed adultery</b> is executed <b>by stoning. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> She is executed <b>by burning.</b> A betrothed young woman who is the daughter of a non-priest and who <b>engaged in intercourse with her father</b> is executed <b>by stoning. Rabbi Shimon says: By burning.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>What does</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>teach us?</b> The Gemara answers: It teaches us that <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, the married</b> daughter of a priest <b>is singled out for burning, and not a betrothed</b> one, who is executed by stoning. <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> the daughter of a priest, <b>whether</b> she is <b>betrothed or married, is singled out for burning. And what is the reason</b> for their respective opinions with regard to the punishment of the daughter of a priest? It is <b>because according to the Rabbis stoning</b> is more <b>severe</b> than burning, whereas <b>according to Rabbi Shimon burning</b> is more <b>severe.</b>

### Part 12
In addition to the case of the priest’s daughter who committed adultery, there is a practical <b>difference</b> between these two opinions, which is <b>that one who was sentenced to two</b> different <b>court</b>-imposed <b>death</b> penalties for two sins he committed <b>is punished with the</b> more <b>severe</b> of the two, and these <i>tanna’im</i> disagree as to which type of death penalty is more severe.

### Part 13
<b>What</b> is the source of the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> that a priest’s betrothed daughter who committed adultery is executed by stoning? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Two general</b> <i>halakhot</i> <b>are stated</b> in the Torah <b>with regard to the daughter of a priest,</b> one rendering the betrothed daughter of a priest who committed adultery liable to be executed by stoning, and the other rendering the married daughter of a priest who committed adultery liable to be executed by strangulation.

### Part 14
The Gemara interrupts the <i>baraita</i> and asks: Are they stated only <b>with regard to the daughter of a priest, and not with regard to the daughter of a non-priest?</b> Aren’t these <i>halakhot</i> stated with regard to the daughter of a non-priest as well? Rather, emend the text and <b>say:</b> These two <i>halakhot</i> are stated <b>with regard to the daughter of a priest as well.</b>

### Part 15
The <i>baraita</i> continues: The verse: “And the daughter of a priest, when she profanes herself by playing the harlot, she profanes her father; she shall be burned with fire” (Leviticus 21:9), is stated with regard to both a betrothed woman and a married woman. <b>And the verse</b> thereby <b>singles out</b> the <b>married</b> daughter of a priest <b>from the category of</b> an ordinary <b>married woman,</b> whose punishment is execution by strangulation, <b>and</b> it singles out the <b>betrothed</b> daughter of a priest <b>from the category of</b> an ordinary <b>betrothed woman,</b> who is executed by stoning.

### Part 16
Therefore, <b>just as when the verse singles out</b> the <b>married</b> daughter of a priest <b>from the category of a married woman</b> it is <b>to render</b> her punishment more <b>severe, so too, when the verse singles out</b> the <b>betrothed</b> daughter of a priest <b>from the category of a betrothed woman</b> it is <b>to render</b> her punishment more <b>severe.</b> This indicates that burning is a more severe type of capital punishment than stoning.

### Part 17
The punishment for <b>the conspiring witnesses concerning the married daughter of a priest,</b> who testified falsely that she committed adultery, <b>is included in</b> the punishment for <b>the conspiring witnesses concerning the married daughter of a non-priest, and</b> the punishment for <b>the conspiring witnesses concerning the betrothed daughter of a priest is included in</b> the punishment for <b>the conspiring witnesses concerning the betrothed daughter of a non-priest.</b> The Torah is not more severe with them; the conspiring witnesses in the case of any married woman accused of committing adultery are strangled, and the conspiring witnesses in the case of any betrothed woman accused of committing adultery are stoned.

### Part 18
<b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states: <b>“And the daughter of a priest [<i>ish kohen</i>], when she profanes</b> herself by playing the harlot, she profanes her father; she shall be burned with fire” (Leviticus 21:9). One <b>might</b> have thought that the expression “when she profanes [<i>ki teḥel</i>]” is referring <b>even</b> to one who <b>desecrated [<i>ḥillela</i>] Shabbat;</b> she too should be executed by burning. To counter this, <b>the verse states: “By playing the harlot”; the verse is speaking of profanation through promiscuity.</b>

### Part 19
One <b>might</b> have thought <b>even</b> if she is <b>unmarried</b> and she engaged in promiscuous intercourse she should be executed by burning. This is incorrect, as <b>here it is stated: “Her father,” and there it is stated</b> with regard to a betrothed woman who committed adultery: “Because she has done a depraved thing in Israel, to play the harlot in the house of <b>her father”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:21). <b>Just as there,</b> the reference is to the <b>promiscuous intercourse</b> of one who has <b>a bond to a husband, so too here,</b> the reference is to the <b>promiscuous intercourse</b> of one who has <b>a bond to a husband.</b>

### Part 20
<b>Or</b> perhaps one might have thought that the verse <b>states “her father” only</b> in order <b>to exclude all men</b> except her father, i.e., she is liable to be executed by burning only if she engaged in intercourse with her father. To counter this, <b>when it states “she profanes,”</b> indicating that it is she who profanes her father and not her father who profanes himself and her, <b>all men are stated,</b> i.e., included.

### Part 21
Therefore, <b>how do I realize</b> the meaning of the expression “she profanes <b>her father”?</b> What <i>halakha</i> does it teach? The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>Here it is stated: “Her father,” and there it is stated: “Her father.” Just as there,</b> the reference is to the <b>promiscuous intercourse</b> of one who has <b>a bond to a husband, so too here,</b> the reference is to the <b>promiscuous intercourse</b> of one who has <b>a bond to a husband.</b>

### Part 22
The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>If</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the priest’s daughter who committed adultery is compared, by means of a verbal analogy, to the <i>halakha</i> of a betrothed woman who committed adultery, then perhaps one should say that <b>just as there</b> the reference is specifically to <b>a young woman,</b> i.e., to one whose first signs of maturity appeared within the past half year, <b>who is betrothed, so too here,</b> in the case of the daughter of a priest, the reference is to <b>a young woman who is betrothed.</b> But if she is <b>a young woman who is married,</b> or <b>a grown woman who is betrothed,</b> or <b>a grown woman who is married, or even</b> if she <b>grew old,</b> and is not normally referred to as a daughter, <b>from where</b> is it derived that her punishment is execution by burning?

### Part 23
<b>The verse states: “And the daughter of a priest,” in any case.</b> It is derived from the conjunction “and,” represented by the letter <i>vav</i>, that this punishment applies to any woman who is the daughter of a priest.

### Part 24
The verse states: <b>“The daughter of a priest.”</b>
