### Part 1
<b>the people [<i>leom</i>] shall curse him [<i>yikkevuhu</i>],</b> but blessing shall be upon the head of one who provides” (Proverbs 11:26). <b>And</b> the term <b><i>leom</i></b> is referring to <b>nothing other than fetuses, as it is stated:</b> “Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples shall be separated from your bowels; <b>and the one <i>leom</i> shall overcome the other <i>leom</i>”</b> (Genesis 25:23). <b>And <i>kabbo</i></b> is referring to <b>nothing other than curse, as it is stated</b> in the statement of Balaam: <b>“How can I curse one who is not cursed [<i>kabbo</i>] by God?”</b> (Numbers 23:8). <b>And <i>bar</i></b> is referring to <b>nothing other than Torah, as it is stated: “Pay homage to <i>bar</i> lest He be angry”</b> (Psalms 2:12), i.e., observe the Torah to avoid God’s wrath.

### Part 2
<b>Ulla bar Yishmael says: One perforates like a sieve</b> a person who withholds <i>halakha</i> from a student. <b>It is written here:</b> “He who withholds <i>bar</i>, <b>the people <i>yikkevuhu</i>”</b> (Proverbs 11:26), <b>and it is written there: “And he bored [<i>vayyikkov</i>] a hole in its lid of it”</b> (II Kings 12:10). <b>And Abaye says:</b> One perforates him <b>like a launderers’ utensil</b> used for sprinkling water on garments.

### Part 3
<b>And if one teaches</b> the student <i>halakha</i> rather than withholding it, <b>what is his reward? Rava says</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet says: He is privileged</b> to receive <b>blessings like Joseph, as it is stated</b> at the end of that verse: <b>“But blessing shall be upon the head of one who provides [<i>mashbir</i>]”</b> (Proverbs 11:26). <b>And <i>mashbir</i></b> is referring to <b>no</b> one <b>other than Joseph, as it is stated: “And Joseph was the governor of the land, and he was the provider [<i>hamashbir</i>] to all the people of the land”</b> (Genesis 42:6).

### Part 4
<b>Rav Sheshet says: Anyone who teaches Torah in this world is privileged and teaches it in the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “And he who satisfies abundantly [<i>umarveh</i>] shall be satisfied himself [<i>yoreh</i>]”</b> (Proverbs 11:25). Rav Sheshet interprets the verse homiletically: By transposing the letters of the word <i>marveh</i>: <i>Mem</i>, <i>reish</i>, <i>vav</i>, <i>heh</i>, one arrives at the word <i>moreh</i>, meaning teaches. The verse means that one who teaches [<i>moreh</i>] will teach [<i>yoreh</i>] in the future as well.

### Part 5
The Gemara returns to the topic of the source for resurrection in the Torah. <b>Rava says: From where</b> is <b>resurrection of the dead</b> derived <b>from the Torah?</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “Let Reuben live and not die,</b> in that his men become few” (Deuteronomy 33:6). This is interpreted: <b>“Let Reuben live” in this world “and not die” in the World-to-Come. Ravina says</b> that resurrection is derived <b>from here: “And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awaken, some to everlasting life, and some to reproaches and everlasting disgrace”</b> (Daniel 12:2). <b>Rav Ashi says</b> proof is derived <b>from here: “But go you your way until the end be; and you shall rest, and arise to your lot at the end of days”</b> (Daniel 12:13).

### Part 6
§ <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Any communal leader who leads the community calmly,</b> without anger and honestly, <b>is privileged and leads them in the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “For he that has compassion upon them will lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them”</b> (Isaiah 49:10). Just as he led them in this world, so too will he guide them in the World-to-Come.

### Part 7
The Gemara proceeds to cite additional statements of Rabbi Elazar relating to recommended conduct. <b>And Rabbi Elazar says: Great is knowledge, as it was placed between two letters,</b> two names of God, <b>as it is stated: “For a God of knowledge is the Lord”</b> (I Samuel 2:3).

### Part 8
<b>And Rabbi Elazar says: Great is the Holy Temple, as it</b> too <b>was placed between two letters,</b> two names of God, <b>as it is stated:</b> “The place in which to dwell that <b>You have made, Lord, the Temple, Lord, which Your hands have prepared”</b> (Exodus 15:17). <b>Rav Adda Karḥina’a objects to</b> the explanation that being placed between two names of God accords significance. <b>If that is so,</b> the same should hold true for vengeance. Shall one say: <b>Great</b> is <b>vengeance, as it was placed between two letters, as it is written: “God of vengeance, Lord, God of vengeance shine forth”</b> (Psalms 94:1)?

### Part 9
Rabbi Elazar <b>said to him: In its context, indeed,</b> vengeance is great, <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Ulla. As Ulla says</b> with regard to <b>these two appearances:</b> “O Lord, God to Whom vengeance belongs; God to Whom vengeance belongs, appear” (Psalms 94:1), and: “He appeared from Mount Paran” (Deuteronomy 33:2), <b>why</b> are both necessary? <b>One,</b> the second verse, is necessary <b>for the attribute of</b> divine <b>good,</b> with which God gave the Torah at Sinai, <b>and one,</b> the first verse, is necessary <b>for the attribute of</b> divine <b>punishment,</b> with which God exacts vengeance against the enemies and oppressors of the Jewish people.

### Part 10
<b>And Rabbi Elazar says:</b> With regard to <b>any person in whom there is knowledge,</b> it is <b>as though the Temple was built in his days, as this,</b> knowledge, <b>was placed between two letters and that,</b> the Temple, <b>was placed between two letters.</b>

### Part 11
<b>And Rabbi Elazar says: Any person in whom there is knowledge ultimately becomes wealthy, as it is stated: “And by knowledge are the chambers filled with all precious and pleasant riches”</b> (Proverbs 24:4).

### Part 12
<b>And Rabbi Elazar says:</b> With regard to <b>any person in whom there is no knowledge, it is prohibited to have mercy upon him, as it is stated: “For it is a people of no understanding; therefore its Maker will have no mercy on them, and its Creator will show them no favor”</b> (Isaiah 27:11). If God has no mercy upon them, all the more so should people not show them mercy.

### Part 13
<b>And Rabbi Elazar says:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who gives his bread to one without knowledge, afflictions befall him, as it is stated: “They who eat your bread will place <i>mazor</i> under you, in whom there is no discernment”</b> (Obadiah 1:7). <b>And <i>mazor</i></b> means <b>nothing other than afflictions,</b> based on the parallel with another verse, <b>as it is stated: “And Ephraim saw his sickness and Judah his wound [<i>mezoro</i>]”</b> (Hosea 5:13). This indicates that one who gives his bread to one without discernment will ultimately fall ill.

### Part 14
<b>And Rabbi Elazar says: Any person in whom there is no knowledge is ultimately exiled, as it is stated: “Therefore my people are exiled, for lack of knowledge”</b> (Isaiah 5:13).

### Part 15
<b>And Rabbi Elazar says:</b> With regard to <b>any house in which there are no matters of Torah heard at night, the fire</b> of Gehenna <b>consumes it, as it is stated: “All darkness is laid up for his treasures, a fire not fanned shall consume him; it shall go ill with a <i>sarid</i> in his tent”</b> (Job 20:26). <b><i>Sarid</i></b> is referring to <b>no</b> one <b>but a Torah scholar, as it is stated: “And among the <i>seridim</i>, those whom the Lord shall call”</b> (Joel 3:5). A house that is dark at night and in which no Torah is heard will be consumed by a fire that does not require fanning with a bellows, the fire of Gehenna.

### Part 16
<b>And Rabbi Elazar says: Anyone who does not benefit Torah scholars from his property never sees a sign of blessing, as it is stated: “None of his food shall remain [<i>sarid</i>]; therefore his prosperity shall not endure”</b> (Job 20:21). <b><i>Sarid</i></b> is referring to <b>no</b> one <b>but Torah scholars, as it is stated: “And among the <i>seridim</i>, those whom the Lord shall call.”</b> No prosperity will come to one who does not share his food with a Torah scholar.

### Part 17
<b>And Rabbi Elazar says: Anyone who does not leave bread on his table</b> at the end of his meal indicating his gratitude to God for providing him more than enough <b>never sees a sign of blessing, as it is stated: “None of his food shall remain; therefore his prosperity shall not endure.”</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Elazar say:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who leaves pieces</b> of bread <b>on his table, it is as if he worships idols, as it is stated: “Who prepare a table for Fortune [<i>Gad</i>] and offer blended wine for Destiny”</b> (Isaiah 65:11). The people would leave pieces of bread on the table as an offering to the constellation <i>Gad</i>, which they believed influences the fortune of the home. This practice was a form of idol worship. The Gemara answers: This apparent contradiction is <b>not difficult: This</b> case, where leaving pieces of bread is a form of idol worship, applies <b>when there is a whole</b> loaf together <b>with</b> the pieces, as the addition of the pieces is clearly for idol worship; <b>that</b> case, where failure to leave bread on the table is criticized, applies <b>when there is no whole</b> loaf together <b>with</b> the pieces.

### Part 19
<b>And Rabbi Elazar says:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who amends</b> the truth <b>in his speech, it is as though he worships idols.</b> As, <b>it is written here,</b> in the verse where Jacob sought to resist taking his father’s blessing from Esau: <b>“And I shall seem to him a deceiver [<i>metate’a</i>]”</b> (Genesis 27:12), <b>and it is written there</b> with regard to idol worship: <b>“They are vanity, the work of deception [<i>tatuim</i>]”</b> (Jeremiah 10:15).

### Part 20
<b>And Rabbi Elazar says:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who looks at nakedness [<i>erva</i>], his bow is emptied,</b> i.e., he will be robbed of his potency, <b>as it is stated: “Your bow is stripped bare [<i>erya</i>]”</b> (Habakkuk 3:9).

### Part 21
<b>And Rabbi Elazar says: Forever be in the dark,</b> i.e., anonymous, <b>and</b> you will continue to <b>exist. Rabbi Zeira says: We learn</b> a similar idea in a mishna <b>as well</b> (<i>Nega’im</i> 2:3): In <b>a dark house, one does not open windows to</b> illuminate <b>it</b> in order <b>to see</b> whether or not <b>its</b> blemish is <b>leprosy,</b> and the house retains the presumptive status of ritual purity. Those matters that are obscured are allowed to continue. The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from</b> that mishna that this is so.

### Part 22
§ The Gemara returns to the topic of the source for resurrection in the Torah. <b>Rabbi Tavi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoshiya says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “There are three that are never satisfied…<b>the grave, and the barren womb, and earth that does not receive sufficient water”</b> (Proverbs 30:15–16)? <b>And what does a grave have to do with a womb? Rather,</b> they are juxtaposed <b>to say to you: Just as a womb takes in and gives forth, so too a grave takes in and</b> also <b>gives forth,</b> with the resurrection of the dead.

### Part 23
<b>And are</b> these <b>matters not</b> inferred <b><i>a fortiori</i>: If</b> with regard to <b>a womb, into which one introduces</b> the embryo <b>in secret, one removes</b> the baby <b>from it</b> accompanied <b>by</b> the <b>loud sounds</b> of the woman crying out during childbirth, then with regard to <b>the grave, into which one introduces</b> the corpse <b>with sounds</b> of wailing and mourning the dead, <b>is it not right that one removes</b> from it the resurrected dead accompanied <b>by</b> the <b>loud sounds</b> of the resurrected multitudes? <b>From here</b> there is <b>a response to</b> those who <b>say: There is no resurrection of the dead</b> derived <b>from the Torah.</b>

### Part 24
<b>The school of Eliyahu taught: The righteous whom the Holy One, Blessed be He, is destined to resurrect do not return to their dust, as it is stated: “And it shall come to pass, that he who remains in Zion and he who remains in Jerusalem shall be called holy, anyone who is written unto life in Jerusalem”</b> (Isaiah 4:3). <b>Just as</b> the <b>Holy One exists forever, so too will they exist forever.</b>
