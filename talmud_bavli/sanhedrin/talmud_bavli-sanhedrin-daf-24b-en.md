### Part 1
<b>What,</b> is it <b>not</b> referring <b>to those who take an oath and do not pay,</b> i.e., cases where the defendant is obligated to take an oath that the claim against him is false, and he is thereby exempt from paying? Accordingly, it is the claimant who suggests that the defendant take a vow instead, <b>which is the same as</b> saying: If you take a vow, the money I claim you owe <b>is forgiven you.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara rejects this objection: <b>No,</b> it is referring <b>to those who take an oath and collect</b> a debt. There are cases where it is the claimant who is obligated to take an oath, and he then collects the money that he claims. In a case where the defendant suggests that the claimant take a vow instead, <b>it is the same as</b> saying: If you take a vow <b>I will give you</b> what you claim.

### Part 3
The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> according to Rava’s interpretation, the mishna already <b>taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> in a case where the defendant says: I will give you, in <b>the first clause,</b> where the defendant accepts unfit judges.

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: The mishna <b>taught</b> in the former clause a case where the defendant <b>makes</b> the outcome <b>dependent on the decision of others,</b> namely, his father or the father of the claimant; <b>and</b> the mishna <b>taught</b> in the latter clause a case where <b>he makes</b> the outcome <b>dependent on</b> the claimant’s <b>own decision.</b>

### Part 5
<b>And it is necessary</b> for the mishna to teach both cases, <b>since if</b> the mishna <b>taught</b> only the case where <b>he makes</b> the outcome <b>dependent on the decision of others,</b> one might reason that specifically <b>in this</b> case <b>Rabbi Meir says that he can retract</b> his acceptance of the unfit judges. This is <b>because he</b> presumably <b>did not resolve to transfer</b> the money if these judges deem him liable, <b>as he</b> must have <b>said</b> to himself: <b>Who will say that</b> the judges <b>will rule in favor of</b> the claimant? <b>But</b> in a case where <b>he makes</b> the outcome <b>dependent on</b> the claimant’s <b>own decision</b> by suggesting that he take a vow, <b>say</b> that Rabbi Meir <b>concedes to the Rabbis</b> that the defendant cannot retract his commitment to pay.

### Part 6
<b>And</b> conversely, <b>if</b> the mishna <b>would teach us</b> only <b>this</b> latter case, where the defendant suggests that the claimant take a vow, one might reason that specifically <b>in this</b> case <b>the Rabbis say</b> that he cannot retract his offer; <b>but in that</b> former case, where he makes the outcome dependent on the decision of others, <b>say</b> that <b>the Rabbis concede to Rabbi Meir</b> that he can retract his acceptance of the unfit judges. Therefore, <b>it is necessary</b> for the mishna to teach both cases.

### Part 7
§ <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis concerns whether or not one can retract his acceptance of unfit judges <b>before the verdict</b> is issued. <b>But after the verdict</b> is issued, <b>everyone agrees</b> that <b>one cannot retract</b> his acceptance, as he has already been deemed liable. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> concerns whether or not one can retract his acceptance <b>after the verdict</b> is issued.

### Part 8
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages with regard to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Is the <b>dispute</b> over whether one can retract his acceptance <b>after the verdict</b> is issued, <b>but before the verdict</b> is issued, <b>everyone agrees</b> that <b>he can retract</b> his acceptance? <b>Or perhaps</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan maintains that the <b>dispute is both with regard to this</b> case <b>and with regard to that</b> case.

### Part 9
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to the dilemma, <b>as Rava says:</b> If one <b>accepted a relative upon himself</b> as a judge or witness, <b>or</b> if he accepted <b>one who is disqualified</b> for another reason from serving as a judge or a witness, <b>he can retract</b> his acceptance <b>before the verdict</b> is issued. <b>He cannot retract</b> his acceptance <b>after the verdict</b> is issued.

### Part 10
<b>Granted,</b> this makes sense <b>if you say</b> that according to Rabbi Yoḥanan too, the <b>dispute</b> concerns whether one can retract his acceptance <b>after the verdict</b> is issued, <b>but before the verdict</b> is issued <b>everyone agrees</b> that <b>one can retract</b> his acceptance; then this means that <b>Rava is stating</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, and according to</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis. But if you say</b> that according to Rabbi Yoḥanan, the <b>dispute is both with regard to this</b> case <b>and with regard to that</b> case, then <b>in accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is Rava stating</b> the <i>halakha</i>? His statement is in accordance with the opinion of neither Reish Lakish nor Rabbi Yoḥanan.

### Part 11
<b>Rather,</b> must we <b>not conclude from</b> Rava’s statement that the <b>dispute</b> is over whether one can retract his acceptance <b>after the verdict</b> is issued? The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from</b> Rava’s statement that this is so.

### Part 12
<b>Rav Naḥman, son of Rav Ḥisda, sent</b> the following question <b>to Rav Naḥman bar Ya’akov: Our teacher, instruct us:</b> Does the <b>dispute</b> concern whether or not one can retract his acceptance <b>before the verdict</b> is issued, <b>or</b> does the <b>dispute</b> concern whether or not one can retract his acceptance <b>after the verdict</b> is issued? <b>And</b> furthermore, <b>in accordance with whose statement</b> is <b>the <i>halakha</i>?</b> Rav Naḥman bar Ya’akov <b>sent to him</b> in response: The <b>dispute</b> concerns whether one can retract his acceptance <b>after the verdict</b> is issued, <b>and the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with the statement of the Rabbis.</b>

### Part 13
<b>Rav Ashi says</b> a different version of the question and answer: <b>This</b> is the question that Rav Naḥman, son of Rav Ḥisda, <b>sent to</b> Rav Naḥman bar Ya’akov: Is the <b>dispute with regard to</b> a case where the defendant says: <b>I will give you, or</b> is the <b>dispute with regard to</b> a case where the claimant says: The money I claim you owe me is <b>forgiven you? And</b> furthermore, <b>in accordance with whose statement</b> is <b>the <i>halakha</i>?</b> Rav Naḥman bar Ya’akov <b>sent</b> this response <b>to him:</b> The <b>dispute is with regard to</b> a case where the defendant says: <b>I will give you, and the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with the statement of the Rabbis.</b>

### Part 14
<b>In Sura they teach that</b> previous version of the question and the answer. <b>In Pumbedita they teach this</b> following version: <b>Rav Ḥanina bar Shelemya says</b> that <b>they sent</b> the following question <b>from Rav’s study hall to Shmuel: Our teacher, instruct us:</b> In a case where one litigant wishes to retract his acceptance of the judges <b>before the verdict</b> is issued, <b>and</b> the other litigant <b>had performed</b> a formal <b>act of acquisition with him</b> giving legal power to the acceptance, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Shmuel <b>sent them</b> in response: <b>Nothing</b> can be retracted <b>after an act of acquisition</b> was performed.

### Part 15
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>And these</b> on the following list <b>are the ones</b> who are <b>disqualified</b> by the Sages from bearing witness due to their unseemly behavior, as they are considered wicked individuals guilty of monetary transgressions: <b>One who plays with dice [<i>bekubbiyya</i>]</b> for money, <b>and one who lends</b> money <b>with interest, and those who fly pigeons, and merchants</b> who trade in the produce <b>of the Sabbatical</b> Year, which may be eaten but may not be sold as an object of commerce.

### Part 16
<b>Rabbi Shimon said: Initially,</b> people <b>would call them: Gatherers</b> of the produce <b>of the Sabbatical</b> Year. <b>Once the tax collectors grew abundant they would then call them: Merchants</b> who trade in the produce <b>of the Sabbatical</b> Year, as the Gemara will explain.

### Part 17
<b>Rabbi Yehuda said: When</b> are the people listed above disqualified from bearing witness? It is <b>when they have no occupation but this one. But</b> if <b>they have an occupation other than this one,</b> although they also make money by these inappropriate means, <b>they are fit</b> to bear witness.

### Part 18
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who plays with dice</b> for money, <b>what is he doing</b> that disqualifies him from bearing witness? <b>Rami bar Ḥama says:</b> He is disqualified <b>because</b> gambling <b>is a transaction with inconclusive consent [<i>asmakhta</i>],</b> as one who gambles does not have conclusive consent to pay when he loses since he plays under the assumption that he will win. <b>And</b> as <b>an <i>asmakhta</i> does not effect acquisition,</b> the one who wins takes money that is not legally his, and is considered a robber.

### Part 19
<b>Rav Sheshet says: Any case like this is not an <i>asmakhta</i>.</b> In a game of dice both sides realize that they might lose, and consent at the outset to pay if that happens. <b>Rather,</b> those who play dice are disqualified <b>because they are not involved in settling the world,</b> i.e., in productive occupations that demand hard work. Since they do not realize the effort required of most people to earn a living they might not be scrupulous about other people’s money, and their testimony cannot be relied upon.

### Part 20
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the practical difference <b>between</b> the explanations of Rami bar Ḥama and Rav Sheshet? The Gemara answers: The practical difference <b>between them</b> is in a case <b>where</b> the dice player <b>learns another occupation,</b> and is involved in that occupation as well. According to Rav Sheshet, since he has a productive occupation he is fit to bear witness. According to Rami bar Ḥama, since he is considered a robber, as the money he gains from gambling is not legally his, he is disqualified.

### Part 21
The Gemara raises a difficulty against the opinion of Rami bar Ḥama: <b>But we learned</b> in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: When</b> are they disqualified from bearing witness? It is <b>when they have no occupation but this one. But</b> if <b>they have an occupation other than this one they are fit</b> to bear witness. <b>Apparently, the reason that the mishna</b> disqualifies these individuals from bearing witness <b>is that</b> they are not involved in <b>settling the world,</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rav Sheshet. This poses <b>a difficulty to</b> the opinion of <b>Rami bar Ḥama.</b>

### Part 22
<b>And if you would say</b> this is not difficult, as <b>the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Yehuda,</b> this would be a problem as well. <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi say: Any place where Rabbi Yehuda says</b> in the corpus of the Mishna:
