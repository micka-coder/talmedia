### Part 1
<b>And that is</b> the background for the following exchange, <b>as a certain heretic said to Rabbi Abbahu: When will</b> the <b>Messiah come?</b> Rabbi Abbahu <b>said to him:</b> He will come <b>when the darkness will enshroud these people,</b> i.e., you. The heretic <b>said to him:</b> Are <b>you cursing me</b> for no reason? Rabbi Abbahu <b>said to him,</b> I am merely relating to you <b>a verse</b> that <b>is written: “For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and fog the peoples; but the Lord shall shine upon you, and His glory shall be seen upon you”</b> (Isaiah 60:2).

### Part 2
§ <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: The messianic era will be forty years</b> long, <b>as it is stated: “Forty years will I strive with the generation”</b> (Psalms 95:10). The forty years of strife with the gentiles will be followed by the glory days of the Messiah. <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says:</b> The messianic era will last <b>seventy years, as it is stated: “And it shall come to pass on that day, that Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king”</b> (Isaiah 23:15). In this context, one [<i>eḥad</i>], means unique [<i>meyuḥad</i>]. <b>Which is</b> the <b>unique king? You must say</b> that <b>this is</b> a reference to the <b>Messiah.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The messianic era will last <b>three generations, as it is stated: “May they fear You as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout the generations [<i>dor dorim</i>]”</b> (Psalms 72:5). <i>Dor</i> is singular and <i>dorim</i> is plural, for a total of three generations. <b>Rabbi Hillel says: There is no Messiah</b> coming <b>for the Jewish people, as they already ate</b> from <b>him,</b> as all the prophecies relating to the Messiah were already fulfilled, <b>during the days of Hezekiah.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rav Yosef says: May the Master forgive Rabbi Hillel</b> for stating matters with no basis. With regard to <b>Hezekiah, when was</b> his reign? It was <b>during the First Temple</b> period. <b>Whereas Zechariah</b> ben Berechiah, the prophet, <b>prophesied during the Second Temple</b> period <b>and said: “Rejoice greatly, daughter of Zion; shout, daughter of Jerusalem; behold, your king will come to you; he is just and victorious; lowly and riding upon a donkey and upon a colt, the foal of a donkey”</b> (Zechariah 9:9). In the generations after Hezekiah, there are prophecies about both redemption and the coming of the Messiah.

### Part 5
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: The messianic era</b> will be <b>forty years</b> long. <b>It is written here</b> with regard to the forty-year sojourn of the children of Israel in the wilderness: <b>“And He afflicted you, and suffered you to hunger and fed you</b> with manna” (Deuteronomy 8:3); <b>and it is written there: “Make us glad according to the days that You afflicted us, the years that we saw evil”</b> (Psalms 90:15).

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Dosa says:</b> The messianic era will last <b>four hundred years. It is written here</b> with regard to the Covenant of the Pieces: <b>“And they shall serve them, and they shall afflict them four hundred years”</b> (Genesis 15:13); <b>and it is written there: “Make us glad according to the days that You afflicted us.”</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The messianic era will last <b>365 years, corresponding to the number of days of the solar</b> year, <b>as it is stated: “For the day of vengeance is in My heart, and the year of My redeemed is come”</b> (Isaiah 63:4).

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>“For the day of vengeance is in My heart”? Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that it means that God said: <b>I revealed</b> the day of vengeance <b>to My heart,</b> but <b>I did not reveal</b> it <b>to My limbs,</b> as it were, as I never stated it explicitly. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says</b> that it means that God said: <b>I revealed</b> this secret <b>to My heart,</b> but <b>I did not reveal</b> it to <b>the ministering angels.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Avimi, son of Rabbi Abbahu, taught: The messianic era for the Jewish people</b> will last <b>seven thousand years, as it is stated: “And as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall your God rejoice over you”</b> (Isaiah 62:5). The bridegroom rejoices over the bride for seven days, and the day of the Holy One, Blessed be He, is one thousand years.

### Part 10
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The duration of <b>the messianic era is like</b> the duration of the period that runs <b>from the day the world was created until now,</b> i.e., the day when the Messiah will come, <b>as it is stated:</b> “That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land that the Lord swore to your fathers to give them, <b>as the days of heaven upon the earth”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:21).

### Part 11
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says:</b> The duration of <b>the messianic era is like</b> the duration of the period that runs <b>from the days of Noah until now,</b> i.e., the day when the Messiah will come, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to redemption: <b>“For this is as the seas of [<i>ki mei</i>] Noah to me; as I have sworn</b> that the seas of Noah shall no more go over the earth, so have I sworn that I will not be angry with you nor rebuke you” (Isaiah 54:9). The words <i>ki mei</i> can be understood as one word, <i>kimei</i>, meaning: Like the days of.

### Part 12
§ <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In their prophecies with regard to redemption and the end of days, <b>all the prophets prophesied only about the messianic era, but with regard to the World-to-Come</b> the reward is not quantifiable, as it states: <b>“No eye has seen it, God, aside from You, Who will do for those who await Him”</b> (Isaiah 64:3). The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> this statement <b>disagrees with</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel, as Shmuel says: The</b> difference <b>between this world and the messianic era is only</b> with regard to <b>servitude to</b> foreign <b>kingdoms alone,</b> as they will leave Eretz Yisrael.

### Part 13
<b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: All of the prophets prophesied</b> their prophecies of consolation <b>only with regard to penitents, but with regard to</b> the reward of <b>the completely righteous</b> it is stated: <b>“No eye has seen it, God, aside from You.”</b> The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> the opinion expressed in <b>this</b> statement <b>disagrees with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Abbahu,</b> who holds that penitents are superior to the righteous, <b>as Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that <b>Rav says: In the place where penitents stand,</b> even <b>the completely righteous do not stand, as it is stated: “Peace, peace upon him who is far and him who is near”</b> (Isaiah 57:19). Peace and greeting is extended <b>first</b> to <b>him who is far, and</b> only <b>thereafter</b> is peace extended to <b>him who is near. What</b> is the meaning of the term: “Upon him who is <b>far”?</b> It means: One who was <b>initially far,</b> i.e., the penitent. <b>And what</b> is the meaning of the term: “Him who is <b>near”?</b> It means: One who was <b>initially near and</b> continues to be near <b>at present,</b> i.e., the completely righteous individual.

### Part 14
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: “Upon him who is far”</b> is referring to one <b>who is distant from transgression,</b> the completely righteous individual. “Him who is <b>near”</b> is referring to one <b>who is near to transgression and distanced</b> himself <b>from it,</b> the penitent.

### Part 15
<b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: All of the prophets prophesied</b> their prophecies of consolation <b>only with regard to one who</b> values wisdom and therefore <b>marries his daughter to a Torah scholar, and to one who conducts business [<i>perakmatya</i>] on behalf of a Torah scholar, and to one who</b> utilizes his wealth <b>to benefit a Torah scholar from his property</b> in some other way. <b>But</b> the prophets did not describe the extent of the reward for <b>Torah scholars themselves,</b> whose reward is not quantifiable, as it is stated: <b>“No eye has seen it, God, aside from You.”</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> reward is indicated in the phrase <b>“no eye has seen it”? Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: This is wine preserved in its grapes from the six days of Creation.</b> No person has drunk that wine and therefore no one can appreciate its quality. <b>Reish Lakish says: This is Eden,</b> which <b>no eye has ever seen. And if you say: Where did Adam</b> the first man <b>live,</b> if not in Eden, the answer is that he lived <b>in the garden. And lest you say:</b> The <b>garden is Eden</b> and they are indistinguishable, <b>the verse states: “And a river emerged from Eden to irrigate the garden”</b> (Genesis 2:10), indicating that they are two distinct places.

### Part 17
§ The mishna teaches that those who have no share in the World-to-Come include: <b>And one who says:</b> The <b>Torah</b> did <b>not</b> originate <b>from Heaven. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that with regard to the verse: <b>“Because he has despised the word of the Lord and has breached His commandment;</b> that soul <b>shall be excised;</b> his iniquity shall be upon him” (Numbers 15:31), <b>this</b> is a reference to <b>one who says:</b> The <b>Torah</b> did <b>not</b> originate <b>from Heaven. Alternatively,</b> one can explain: <b>“Because he has despised the word of the Lord”; this</b> is a reference to <b>an <i>epikoros</i>,</b> who treats the word of God with contempt.

### Part 18
<b>Alternatively,</b> one can explain: <b>“Because he has despised the word of the Lord”; this</b> is a reference to <b>one who interprets the Torah inappropriately. “And has breached His commandment”; this</b> is a reference to <b>one who breaches the covenant of flesh,</b> who refuses to circumcise his foreskin. <b>“Shall be excised [<i>hikkaret tikkaret</i>]”; “<i>hikkaret</i>”</b> refers to being excised <b>in this world,</b> and <b>“<i>tikkaret</i>”</b> refers to being excised <b>from the World-to-Come. From here Rabbi Elazar HaModa’i says:</b> With regard to <b>one who desecrates consecrated</b> items, e.g., intentionally rendering them impure; <b>and one who treats</b> the intermediate days of <b>the Festivals with contempt; and one who breaches the covenant of Abraham our forefather; and one who reveals aspects in the Torah that are not in accordance with <i>halakha</i>; and one who humiliates another in public, even if he has to his credit Torah</b> study <b>and good deeds, he has no share in the World-to-Come.</b>

### Part 19
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Because he has despised the word of the Lord”; this is</b> a reference to <b>one who says</b> the <b>Torah</b> did <b>not</b> originate <b>from Heaven. And even</b> if <b>one says the entire Torah</b> originated <b>from Heaven except for this verse,</b> i.e., any one verse, claiming <b>that the Holy One, Blessed be He, did not say it but Moses</b> himself said it <b>on his own, this is</b> included in the category of: <b>“Because he has despised the word of the Lord.” And even</b> if <b>one says the entire Torah</b> originated <b>from Heaven except for this inference</b> inferred by the Sages, or except <b>for this <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, or except <b>for this verbal analogy, this is</b> included in the category of: <b>“Because he has despised the word of the Lord.”</b>

### Part 20
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say:</b> With regard to <b>one who studies Torah and does not teach it</b> to others, <b>this</b> person <b>is</b> included in the category of: <b>“He has despised the word of the Lord,”</b> as his conduct indicates that he does not consider the word of God significant enough to teach others. <b>Rabbi Natan says: Anyone who does not pay</b> the requisite <b>attention to the Mishna</b> and does not consider it essential <i>halakha</i> is included in the category of: “Because he has despised the word of the Lord.” <b>Rabbi Nehorai says: Anyone</b> for <b>whom</b> it is <b>possible to engage in Torah</b> study <b>and</b> who nevertheless <b>does not engage</b> in its study is included in the category of: “Because he has despised the word of the Lord.”

### Part 21
<b>Rabbi Yishmael says: This</b> verse: “Because he has despised the word of the Lord,” is a reference to <b>an idol worshipper.</b> The Gemara asks: From <b>where</b> in the verse is this <b>inferred?</b> The Gemara explains: It is derived from a verse, <b>as the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: “Because he has despised the word [<i>devar</i>] of the Lord”; this</b> is a reference to <b>one who treats with contempt a statement [<i>dibbur</i>] that was stated to Moses at Sinai</b> and heard by all of the Jewish people: <b>“I am the Lord your God…You shall have no other gods</b> beside me” (Exodus 20:2–3).

### Part 22
Apropos Torah study, <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa says: Anyone who studies Torah and does not review it is comparable to a person who sows and does not reap. Rabbi Yehoshua says: Anyone who studies Torah and causes</b> himself <b>to forget it is similar to a woman who gives birth and buries</b> her newborn child.

### Part 23
<b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b>
