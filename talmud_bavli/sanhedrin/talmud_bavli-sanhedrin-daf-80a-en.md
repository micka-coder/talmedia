### Part 1
<b>If so,</b> according to Shmuel or Reish Lakish, is that compatible with <b>that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to</b> the mishna, that <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> if <b>Abba Ḥalafta,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yosei’s father, who himself was a righteous Sage, was <b>among them?</b> This is difficult according to Shmuel, as Rabbi Yosei would certainly not include his father in a group of murderers, and according to Reish Lakish, what is the connection between Rabbi Yosei’s father and a group of oxen?

### Part 2
<b>Rather, Rava says: This</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying:</b> In a case where <b>two</b> people <b>were standing</b> together <b>and an arrow emerged from their midst and killed</b> a person, since it is not known which of them shot the arrow, <b>both of them are exempt. And Rabbi Yosei says:</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> if <b>Abba Ḥalafta was among them.</b> Even if one of the two people from among whom the arrow emerged was a righteous individual like Abba Ḥalafta, who presumably is not a murderer, since there is no conclusive testimony identifying the shooter, uncertainty remains and both are exempt.

### Part 3
The <i>tanna</i> then proceeds to discuss a different matter. <b>And an ox whose verdict was finalized,</b> that was sentenced to execution by stoning, and <b>that was intermingled with other ordinary oxen,</b> i.e., oxen that did not gore, the court <b>stones</b> all of <b>them. Rabbi Yehuda says: They are placed in a vaulted chamber.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara notes: <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a cow that killed</b> a person, <b>and thereafter calved, if</b> it was <b>before its verdict was finalized</b> that the cow <b>calved, its offspring is permitted. If</b> it was <b>after its verdict was finalized</b> that the cow <b>calved, its offspring is prohibited,</b> as it was prohibited together with the cow. If the cow <b>was intermingled with other</b> cows and the identity of the cow that killed cannot be determined, <b>and</b> those <b>other</b> cows were intermingled <b>with</b> yet <b>others,</b> the court <b>gathers them into a vaulted chamber. Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: One brings them to court and</b> the court <b>stones them.</b> The unattributed <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda in the mishna.

### Part 5
<b>The Master says</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>If</b> the cow <b>calved before its verdict was finalized, its offspring is permitted.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is that the ruling <b>even though when it gored it was</b> already <b>pregnant? But doesn’t Rava say</b> with regard to <b>the offspring of</b> a cow <b>that gores</b> while pregnant: It is <b>prohibited</b> to bring it as an offering, like any animal that killed a person, as the cow <b>and its</b> unborn <b>offspring gored</b> together. And similarly, with regard to <b>the offspring</b> of a cow <b>that was the object of bestiality</b> while the offspring was in utero: It is <b>prohibited</b> to bring it as an offering, as the cow <b>and its</b> unborn <b>offspring</b> were <b>the object of bestiality</b> together. The <i>baraita</i> poses a difficulty according to Rava.

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: Emend the <i>baraita</i> and <b>say</b> that the reference is not to a case where a cow that was pregnant gored; rather, the reference is to a case where a cow was impregnated after it gored, and this is the distinction: <b>If before its verdict was finalized</b> the cow <b>was impregnated and calved, its offspring is permitted; if after its verdict was finalized</b> the cow <b>was impregnated and calved, its offspring is forbidden</b> together with it.

### Part 7
The Gemara challenges: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that in a case where <b>this</b> permitted factor <b>and that</b> forbidden factor <b>cause</b> an outcome to be produced, that outcome is <b>forbidden.</b> The offspring that was produced from a bull from which deriving benefit is permitted and a cow from which deriving benefit is forbidden is therefore forbidden as well.
