### Part 1
The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> the mitzva of establishing courts of <b>judgment is</b> a mitzva to <b>stand up and take action, and</b> nevertheless <b>he counts it</b> among the seven mitzvot. The Gemara answers: This mitzva contains a requirement to <b>stand up and take action,</b> i.e., the obligation to establish courts and carry out justice, <b>and</b> it also contains a requirement to <b>sit and refrain from action,</b> i.e., the prohibition against doing injustice.

### Part 2
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: A gentile who engages in Torah</b> study is <b>liable</b> to receive the <b>death</b> penalty; <b>as it is stated: “Moses commanded us a law [<i>torah</i>], an inheritance</b> of the congregation of Jacob” (Deuteronomy 33:4), indicating that <b>it is an inheritance for us, and not for them.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> if so, <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>count</b> this prohibition <b>among</b> the <b>seven</b> Noahide <b>mitzvot.</b> The Gemara explains: According to <b>the one who says</b> that the verse is referring to the Torah as <b>an inheritance,</b> this prohibition is included in the prohibition of robbery, as a gentile who studies Torah <b>robs</b> the Jewish people of <b>it.</b> According to <b>the one who says</b> that the verse is referring to the Torah as <b>betrothed,</b> as the spelling of the Hebrew word for betrothed [<i>me’orasa</i>], is similar to that of the word for inheritance [<i>morasha</i>], <b>the punishment of</b> a gentile who studies Torah <b>is like</b> that of one who engages in intercourse with <b>a betrothed young woman, which is</b> execution <b>by stoning.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Meir would say: From where</b> is it derived <b>that even a gentile who engages in Torah</b> study <b>is</b> considered <b>like a High Priest?</b> It is derived from <b>that</b> which <b>is stated:</b> “You shall therefore keep My statutes and My ordinances, <b>which if a man does he shall live by them”</b> (Leviticus 18:5). The phrase: Which if <b>priests, Levites, and Israelites</b> do they shall live by them, <b>is not stated,</b> but <b>rather: “A man,”</b> which indicates mankind in general. <b>You have therefore learned that even a gentile who engages in Torah</b> study <b>is</b> considered <b>like a High Priest.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, the reference is to a gentile who engages <b>in</b> the study of <b>their seven mitzvot.</b> It is a mitzva for a gentile to study the <i>halakhot</i> that pertain to the seven Noahide mitzvot, and when he does so he is highly regarded.

### Part 6
§ The <i>baraita</i> that lists the Noahide mitzvot (56a) teaches that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel says:</b> The descendants of Noah are <b>also</b> commanded concerning the prohibition against consuming <b>the blood from a living</b> animal. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the verse: <b>“Only flesh with its life, which is its blood, you shall not eat”</b> (Genesis 9:4), <b>this is</b> the prohibition against eating <b>a limb from a living</b> animal. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel says: The blood from a living</b> animal is <b>also</b> prohibited in this verse.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning</b> behind the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel?</b> The Gemara answers: He <b>reads into</b> the verse: <b>Flesh with its life you shall not eat; blood with its life you shall not eat.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis</b> explain the mention of blood in this verse? After all, in their opinion, blood from a living animal is not forbidden. The Gemara answers: <b>That comes to permit</b> eating limbs from living <b>creeping animals.</b> The verse indicates that the prohibition does not apply to creeping animals, whose blood is not considered separate from their flesh (see 59b).

### Part 8
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Similarly, you</b> can <b>say</b> that according to the opinion of Rabbi Ḥanina, blood from a living animal is also forbidden to the Jewish people in particular; as it is stated: <b>“Only be steadfast in not eating blood, as the blood is the life,</b> and you shall not eat the life with the flesh” (Deuteronomy 12:23). With regard to the statements: <b>“Only be steadfast in not eating blood,” this is a limb from a living</b> animal; <b>“as the blood is the life,” this is blood from a living</b> animal.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis,</b> who hold that there is no specific prohibition with regard to blood from a living animal, interpret this verse? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse <b>comes to</b> teach the prohibition against consuming <b>blood</b> spilled in the process <b>of bloodletting,</b> as this is blood <b>through which the soul departs</b> (see <i>Karetot</i> 20b).

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: According to Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel, <b>why do I</b> need the Torah to write this <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to descendants of Noah, and why do I</b> need the Torah to <b>repeat</b> it <b>at Sinai</b> with regard to Jews? Aren’t Jews also descendants of Noah?

### Part 11
The Gemara answers that it is to be understood <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina; as Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: Any mitzva that was</b> first <b>stated with regard to the descendants of Noah and was repeated at Sinai was stated for this</b> group <b>and for that</b> group, i.e., it applies to both gentiles and Jews.

### Part 12
But a mitzva that was stated <b>with regard to the descendants of Noah and was not repeated at Sinai</b> among the mitzvot given to the Jewish people <b>was stated for the Jewish people and not for the descendants of Noah. And we have only</b> the prohibition against eating <b>the sciatic nerve</b> to which this classification applies, <b>and</b> this is <b>according to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who holds that the verse: “Therefore the children of Israel do not eat the sciatic nerve, which is on the hollow of the thigh, until this day” (Genesis 32:32), is referring to the sons of Jacob, who were commanded to observe this prohibition even though they had the status of descendants of Noah.

### Part 13
§ <b>The Master said</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Any mitzva that was stated with regard to the descendants of Noah and was repeated at Sinai was stated for this</b> group <b>and for that</b> group. The Gemara raises an objection: <b>On the contrary, from</b> the fact <b>that it was repeated at Sinai,</b> clearly it can be derived that <b>it was stated for the Jewish people and not for the descendants of Noah,</b> as if it pertains to the descendants of Noah as well, why repeat it at Sinai? Aren’t the Jewish people are also descendants of Noah?

### Part 14
The Gemara answers: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that</b> the prohibition of <b>idol worship was repeated at Sinai, and we find that</b> God <b>punished gentiles for it, conclude from it</b> that any mitzva that was repeated at Sinai <b>was stated for this</b> group <b>and for that</b> group, and not only for the Jewish people.

### Part 15
It is further stated in the <i>baraita</i> that a mitzva that was stated <b>with regard to the descendants of Noah and was not repeated at Sinai was stated for the Jewish people and not for the descendants of Noah.</b> The Gemara raises an objection: <b>On the contrary, from</b> the fact <b>that it was not repeated at Sinai,</b> clearly it can be derived that <b>it was stated for the descendants of Noah and not for the Jewish people.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>There is nothing that is permitted to a Jew and forbidden to a gentile.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is there <b>not? But isn’t there</b> the permission for a Jew to take a married <b>beautiful woman,</b> who was taken as a prisoner of war, to be his wife? For a gentile to do so is forbidden. The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> the reason gentiles are prohibited from doing so is <b>because they are not authorized to conquer.</b> It is not permitted for gentiles to wage wars of conquest, and the <i>halakha</i> of marrying a beautiful woman is stated only with regard to a war of conquest. Therefore the fact that a beautiful woman who is a prisoner of war is permitted only to a Jew and not to a gentile does not indicate that gentiles have a higher degree of sanctity.

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t</b> stealing <b>less than the value of one <i>peruta</i></b> prohibited to a gentile and permitted to a Jew? The Gemara answers: <b>There it is because</b> gentiles <b>are not apt</b> to grant <b>forgiveness</b> of debts, even of less than the value of one <i>peruta</i>. Therefore, for a gentile to take even such a minuscule amount is considered robbery. Jews normally forgive such small amounts.

### Part 18
It is stated in the <i>baraita</i> that <b>any mitzva that was stated with regard to the descendants of Noah and was repeated at Sinai was stated</b> both <b>for this</b> group <b>and for that</b> group.
