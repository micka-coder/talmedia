### Part 1
<b>The dispute is with regard to</b> a prophet who prophesies to <b>abolish the essence of</b> the prohibition of <b>idol worship, or</b> a prophet who espouses <b>fulfillment</b> of <b>part of</b> the prohibition <b>and nullification</b> of <b>part of</b> the prohibition <b>of idol worship,</b> asserting that idol worship is permitted in certain circumstances, <b>as the Merciful One says:</b> “And that prophet…shall be put to death; because he has spoken perversion against the Lord…to divert you <b>from the way</b> on which the Lord your God commanded you to walk” (Deuteronomy 13:6). It may be inferred from this verse: If he diverts you <b>even</b> from <b>part of the way.</b> In these cases, Rabbi Shimon holds that he is executed by strangulation, and the Rabbis hold that he is executed by stoning.

### Part 2
<b>But</b> if a prophet <b>abolishes the essence of</b> the <b>rest of</b> the <b>mitzvot, everyone agrees</b> that he is executed <b>by strangulation. And</b> if the prophet espouses <b>fulfillment of part and nullification of part of other mitzvot, everyone agrees</b> that he is <b>exempt</b> from punishment. If a true prophet espouses temporary nullification of a specific mitzva, one must heed his words.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Hamnuna raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> that interprets the phrase in the verse “to divert you from the way on which the Lord your God commanded you to walk.” <b>“To walk”; this</b> is a reference to <b>a positive mitzva. “On which”; this</b> is a reference to <b>a prohibition. And if it enters your mind</b> that the verse is stated <b>with regard to idol worship, how can you find a positive mitzva</b> relating to <b>idol worship?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Ḥisda interpreted</b> that the positive mitzva referred to in the verse is: <b>“And you shall smash</b> their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their <i>asherim</i> in fire; and you shall hew down the graven images of their gods; and you shall destroy their name from that place” (Deuteronomy 12:3). A prophet is liable to receive the death penalty if he abolishes this mitzva.

### Part 4
Although his objection was resolved, <b>Rav Hamnuna</b> suggests an alternative explanation of the dispute and <b>says: The dispute is with regard to</b> a prophet who prophesies to <b>abolish the essence</b> of a mitzva, <b>whether</b> it is <b>with regard to idol worship or with regard to</b> the <b>rest of</b> the <b>mitzvot; or</b> a prophet who espouses <b>fulfillment</b> of <b>part of</b> the prohibition <b>and nullification</b> of <b>part of</b> the prohibition <b>of idol worship.</b> This is <b>as the Merciful One says: “From the way,”</b> from which it may be inferred: If he diverts you from <b>even part of the way.</b> In these cases, Rabbi Shimon holds that he is executed by strangulation, and the Rabbis hold that he is executed by stoning.

### Part 5
<b>But</b> if the prophet espouses <b>fulfillment of part and nullification of part of other mitzvot, everyone agrees</b> that he is <b>exempt</b> from punishment, as that is within the prophet’s mandate.

### Part 6
<b>The Sages taught:</b> In the case of <b>one who prophesies to abolish a matter from the Torah,</b> he is deemed a false prophet and is <b>liable</b> to be executed by strangulation. If he prophesies <b>to fulfill part or to nullify part</b> of a matter in the Torah, <b>Rabbi Shimon deems</b> him <b>exempt</b> from execution. <b>And with regard to idol worship, even</b> if he <b>says: Worship it today and tomorrow nullify it, everyone agrees</b> that he is <b>liable.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara comments: <b>Abaye holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ḥisda and explains</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ḥisda. Rava holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Hamnuna and explains</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Hamnuna.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara elaborates: <b>Abaye holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ḥisda and explains</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ḥisda.</b> In the case of <b>one who prophesies to abolish a matter from the Torah, everyone agrees</b> that he is executed <b>by strangulation.</b> If he prophesies <b>to fulfill part or to nullify part</b> of a Torah law, <b>Rabbi Shimon deems</b> him <b>exempt</b> from execution, <b>and the same is true of the Rabbis,</b> who also hold that he is exempt. <b>And with regard to idol worship, even if he says: Worship it today and nullify it tomorrow,</b> everyone agrees that he is <b>liable</b> to be executed. What form of death penalty is imposed? One <b>Sage,</b> the Rabbis, rules <b>in accordance with</b> what <b>he holds,</b> i.e., stoning, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Shimon, rules <b>in accordance with</b> what <b>he holds,</b> i.e., strangulation.

### Part 9
<b>Rava holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Hamnuna and explains</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Hamnuna.</b> In the case of <b>one who prophesies to abolish a matter from the Torah, whether</b> it is <b>with regard to idol worship or with regard to</b> the <b>rest of</b> the <b>mitzvot,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to be executed. What form of death penalty is imposed? One <b>Sage,</b> the Rabbis, rules <b>in accordance with</b> what <b>he holds,</b> i.e., stoning, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Shimon, rules <b>in accordance with</b> what <b>he holds,</b> i.e., strangulation. If he prophesies <b>to fulfill part or to nullify part</b> of a Torah law other than idol worship, <b>Rabbi Shimon deems</b> him <b>exempt</b> from execution, <b>and the same is true of the Rabbis,</b> who also hold that he is exempt. <b>And with regard to idol worship, even</b> if <b>he says: Worship it today and nullify it tomorrow,</b> everyone agrees that he is <b>liable</b> to be executed. What form of death penalty is imposed? One <b>Sage,</b> the Rabbis, rules <b>in accordance with</b> what <b>he holds,</b> i.e., stoning, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Shimon, rules <b>in accordance with</b> what <b>he holds,</b> i.e., strangulation.

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says,</b> in summary: <b>With regard to all</b> mitzvot, <b>if a prophet will say to you: Violate matters of Torah</b> on a provisional basis, <b>heed him, except for idol worship, as even</b> if he establishes that he is a bona fide prophet and <b>stops the sun for you in the middle of the sky, do not heed him. It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: The Torah ascertained the depth of the mentality of idol worship,</b> the danger that it presents, and the lure of its ideology. <b>Therefore, the Torah ascribed</b> the false prophet with <b>dominion in its</b> regard, recognizing that a false prophet could perform wonders on the basis of idol worship. Therefore, <b>even</b> if the false prophet <b>stops the sun for you in the middle of the sky, do not heed him.</b>

### Part 11
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Akiva says: Heaven forfend that the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> would <b>stop the sun for</b> those who <b>violate His will.</b> A false prophet could never perform an actual miracle. <b>Rather,</b> this warning is relevant only in the case of a prophet, <b>for example, Hananiah, son of Azzur, whose origin</b> was as <b>a true prophet,</b> at which point he could perform miracles; <b>and ultimately,</b> he was <b>a false prophet.</b> Therefore, although he had already been established as a true prophet, once he espouses idol worship, it is clear that he is a false prophet.

### Part 12
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And conspiring</b> witnesses who testified that <b>the daughter of a priest</b> and her paramour committed adultery are executed by strangulation. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, says:</b> It is derived <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei says: What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> with regard to conspiring witnesses: <b>“And you shall do to him as he conspired to do to his brother”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:19)? The verse is formulated in this manner <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> in <b>all</b> cases involving those <b>rendered conspiring</b> witnesses <b>who are</b> mentioned <b>in the Torah,</b> e.g., forbidden relatives, the sentences of <b>their conspiring</b> witnesses <b>and their paramours are similar</b> to their own sentences, and the witnesses are executed by strangulation.

### Part 13
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>The daughter of a priest</b> is an exception, as <b>she</b> is executed <b>by burning</b> if she commits adultery, <b>and her paramour is not</b> executed <b>by burning.</b> With regard to <b>conspiring</b> witnesses who testified that they committed adultery, <b>I do not know if the</b> witnesses <b>are likened to</b> the paramour or <b>if</b> they <b>are likened to</b> the daughter of the priest, in terms of punishment. <b>When</b> the verse <b>states</b> with regard to conspiring witnesses: “As he conspired <b>to do to his brother,”</b> one infers: As he conspired to do <b>to his brother, but not</b> as he conspired to do <b>to his sister.</b> The execution of the conspiring witnesses is likened to the execution of the paramour, who is executed by strangulation, and is not likened to the execution of the daughter of the priest, who is executed by burning.
