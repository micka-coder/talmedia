### Part 1
They said to him: <b>If so we will not clear a path through vineyards,</b> i.e., we will continue to sin.

### Part 2
<b>Rava taught: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “A contemptible torch [<i>lapid</i>] in the thought of him that is at ease, a thing ready for them whose foot slips”</b> (Job 12:5)? This <b>teaches that Noah the righteous would rebuke</b> the people of his generation, <b>and he said to them statements that are harsh as torches [<i>kelapidim</i>], and they would treat him with contempt. They said to him: Old man, why</b> are you building <b>this ark?</b> Noah <b>said to them: The Holy One, Blessed be He, is bringing a flood upon you. They said to him: A flood of what? If it is a flood of fire, we have another item and it is called <i>alita</i>,</b> and it is fireproof. <b>And if</b> it is a flood <b>of water</b> that <b>He brings, if He brings</b> the water <b>from the earth, we have iron plates with which we</b> can <b>plate the earth</b> to prevent the water from rising. <b>And if He brings</b> the water <b>from the heavens, we have an item and it is called <i>ekev</i>, and some say it is called <i>ikkesh</i>,</b> which will absorb the water.

### Part 3
Noah <b>said to them:</b> If He wishes <b>He will bring</b> the water <b>from between your feet</b> and you can do nothing to prevent it, <b>as it is stated: “For them whose foot slips.” It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The waters of the flood were</b> as <b>hard</b> and thick <b>as semen, as it is stated: “For them whose foot slips”;</b> foot is a euphemism. <b>Rav Ḥisda says: With hot</b> semen <b>they sinned, and with hot</b> water <b>they were punished.</b> As <b>it is written here,</b> at the conclusion of the flood: <b>“And the waters assuaged”</b> (Genesis 8:1), <b>and it is written there: “Then the king’s wrath was assuaged”</b> (Esther 7:10). Just as the term “assuaged” there is referring to the heat of Ahasuerus’s wrath, so too, “assuaged” with regard to the flood is referring to the heat of the waters.

### Part 4
With regard to the verse: <b>“And it came to pass that after seven days the waters of the flood were upon the earth”</b> (Genesis 7:10), the Gemara asks: <b>What is the nature of</b> these <b>seven</b> additional <b>days?</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rav says: These were the days of mourning</b> for the death <b>of Methuselah;</b> and this is <b>to teach you that eulogies for the righteous prevent calamities from ensuing. Alternatively, “after seven</b> days” means <b>that the Holy One, Blessed be He, altered the order of Creation for</b> that generation, i.e., in seven days He reversed the process of Creation, so <b>that the sun would emerge in the west and set in the east. Alternatively,</b> it means <b>that the Holy One, Blessed be He, designated a substantial period for them,</b> one hundred and twenty years, to repent, <b>and thereafter</b> designated <b>a brief period</b> for them, an additional seven days, as a final opportunity for them to repent. <b>Alternatively, “after seven days”</b> means <b>that</b> during those seven days, God <b>gave them a foretaste</b> of the delights <b>of the World-to-Come,</b> which will be actualized during the seventh millennium, <b>so that they would know what munificence</b> their sins <b>prevented them from</b> receiving.

### Part 6
§ With regard to the verse: <b>“Of every kosher animal you shall take to you by sevens, husband and wife”</b> (Genesis 7:2), the Gemara asks: <b>Is there marriage for animals? Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says:</b> The reference is to <b>those</b> animals <b>with which</b> the <b>transgression</b> of relations with another species <b>was not performed.</b> Therefore, the Torah underscores that the animals that entered the ark were husband and wife.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>From where did</b> Noah <b>know</b> which animals were not involved in that transgression? <b>Rav Ḥisda says: He passed them before the ark. All</b> animals <b>that the ark accepted, it was known that a transgression had not been performed with them. And any</b> animal <b>that the ark did not accept, it was known that a transgression had been performed with it. Rabbi Abbahu says:</b> Noah took onto the ark only <b>from those</b> animals <b>that came on their own,</b> as it appeared that they were sent from Heaven, and they were certainly fit for this purpose.

### Part 8
With regard to the verse: <b>“Make you an ark of gopher wood”</b> (Genesis 6:14), the Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is <b>gopher</b> wood? <b>Rav Adda says</b> that <b>they say in the school of Rabbi Sheila: This</b> is wood from the <b><i>mavliga</i></b> tree; <b>and some say</b> that it is wood from the <b>willow [<i>gulamish</i>]</b> tree.

### Part 9
With regard to the verse: <b>“A <i>tzohar</i> you shall make for the ark”</b> (Genesis 6:16), <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Noah: Set precious stones and jewels in</b> the ark <b>so that they will shine for you as the afternoon [<i>tzohorayim</i>]</b> sun.

### Part 10
With regard to the verse: <b>“And to a cubit you shall finish it above”</b> (Genesis 6:16), the Gemara explains <b>that in that manner,</b> having been built wide at its base and narrow at its top, the ark would <b>stand</b> upright and would not capsize.

### Part 11
With regard to the verse: <b>“With lower, second and third stories shall you make it”</b> (Genesis 6:16), it was <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The bottom</b> story was <b>for manure, the middle</b> story was <b>for animals, and the top</b> story was <b>for people.</b>

### Part 12
With regard to the verse: <b>“And he sent forth the raven,</b> which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from the earth” (Genesis 8:7), <b>Reish Lakish says: The raven</b> provided <b>a convincing response to Noah;</b> when it did not wish to leave the ark the raven <b>said to him: Your Master,</b> God, <b>hates me, and you hate me. Your Master hates me,</b> as He commanded to take <b>from the kosher</b> species <b>seven</b> and <b>from the non-kosher</b> species <b>two. And you hate me, as you disregard</b> those <b>from the species of seven,</b> i.e., the kosher birds, <b>and</b> instead <b>dispatch</b> one <b>from the species of two,</b> i.e., the non-kosher birds. <b>If the angel of heat or the angel of cold harms me</b> and kills me, <b>will the world not be lacking one</b> species of <b>creature,</b> as there was only one pair of ravens? <b>Or perhaps</b> you are sending me because it is <b>my wife</b> that <b>you need,</b> in order to engage in intercourse with her.

### Part 13
Noah <b>said to</b> the raven: <b>Wicked one!</b> If <b>with</b> the woman <b>who is</b> generally <b>permitted to me,</b> my wife, intercourse <b>is forbidden to me,</b> then <b>with</b> regard to domesticated and undomesticated animals, <b>which are</b> generally <b>forbidden to me,</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> the case that they are forbidden to me?

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that it was prohibited</b> for them to engage in intercourse while in the ark? The Gemara answers: It is derived from that <b>which is written: “And you shall come into the ark, you, and your sons, and your wife, and your sons’ wives with you”</b> (Genesis 6:18); <b>and it is written: “Emerge from the ark, you and your wife, and your sons and your sons’ wives with you”</b> (Genesis 8:16). <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: From here,</b> the Sages derived and <b>said that it was prohibited</b> to engage <b>in intercourse</b> while in the ark, as when Noah and his family entered, the husbands and wives were listed separately, and when they emerged, the husbands were listed with their wives.

### Part 15
<b>The Sages taught: Three</b> violated that directive and <b>engaged in intercourse</b> while <b>in the ark, and all of them were punished</b> for doing so. They are: The <b>dog, and</b> the <b>raven, and Ham,</b> son of Noah. The <b>dog</b> was punished in that it <b>is bound;</b> the <b>raven</b> was punished in that it <b>spits,</b> and <b>Ham was afflicted in</b> that <b>his skin</b> turned black.

### Part 16
With regard to the verse: <b>“And he sent forth the dove from him, to see if the waters abated”</b> (Genesis 8:8), <b>Rabbi Yirmeya says: From here</b> it is derived <b>that the dwelling place of kosher birds</b> in the ark was <b>with the righteous</b> people, as the verse emphasizes that Noah dispatched the dove from his place.

### Part 17
With regard to the verse: <b>“And in her mouth was an olive branch plucked off [<i>taraf</i> ]”</b> (Genesis 8:11), <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The <b>dove said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, may my sustenance be bitter as the olive and dependent on Your hands, and not sweet as honey and dependent on the hands of flesh and blood.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where may</b> it <b>be inferred that <i>taraf</i> is a term</b> that indicates <b>sustenance?</b> The Gemara answers: It is inferred from that <b>which is written: “Feed me [<i>hatrifeni</i>] with my allotted portion”</b> (Proverbs 30:8).

### Part 18
With regard to the verse: <b>“After their kinds [<i>lemishpeḥoteihem</i>], they emerged from the ark”</b> (Genesis 8:19), <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: After their kinds [<i>lemishpeḥotam</i>]</b> the animals emerged, <b>but not them [<i>hem</i>]</b> themselves, as some of the animals that entered the ark died during that year and it was their descendants who emerged.

### Part 19
<b>Rav Ḥana bar Bizna says: Eliezer,</b> servant of Abraham, <b>said to Shem the Great,</b> son of Noah: <b>It is written: “After their kinds, they emerged from the ark,”</b> indicating that the different types of animals were not intermingled while in the ark. <b>Where were you</b> and what did you do to care for them while they were in the ark? Shem <b>said to him: We</b> experienced <b>great suffering in the ark</b> caring for the animals. Where there was <b>a creature that one typically feeds during the day, we fed it during the day,</b> and where there was a creature <b>that one typically feeds at night, we fed it at night.</b> With regard to <b>that chameleon, my father did not know what it eats. One day,</b> my father <b>was sitting and peeling a pomegranate. A worm fell from it</b> and the chameleon <b>ate it. From that point forward</b> my father <b>would knead bran</b> with water, and <b>when it became overrun with worms,</b> the chameleon would <b>eat</b> it.

### Part 20
With regard to <b>the lion, a fever sustained it,</b> since when it suffered from a fever, it did not need to eat; <b>as Rav said:</b> For <b>no fewer than six</b> days <b>and no more than twelve</b> days, <b>fever sustains</b> a person; he need not eat and is sustained from his own fats. Shem continued: With regard to the <b>phoenix [<i>avarshina</i>], my father found it lying in</b> its compartment on <b>the side of the ark. He said to</b> the bird: <b>Do you not want food?</b> The bird <b>said to him: I saw that you were busy,</b> and <b>I said I would not trouble you</b> by requesting food. Noah <b>said to</b> the bird: <b>May it be</b> God’s <b>will that you shall not die,</b> and through that bird the verse was fulfilled, <b>as it is stated: “And I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the phoenix”</b> (Job 29:18).

### Part 21
§ <b>Rav Ḥana bar Leva’ei says</b> that <b>Shem the Great said to Eliezer,</b> servant of Abraham: <b>When</b> the four great <b>kings of the east and the west came upon you</b> to wage war with Abraham, <b>what did you do?</b> Eliezer <b>said to him: The Holy One, Blessed be He, brought Abraham and placed him to His right, and we would throw dust and it became swords,</b> and we threw <b>straw and it became arrows, as it is stated: “A Psalm of David. The Lord says to my master: Sit to My right, until I make your enemies your footstool”</b> (Psalms 110:1), <b>and it is written: “Who has raised up one from the east at whose steps victory attends? He gives nations before him, and makes him rule over kings; his sword makes them as the dust, his bow as driven straw”</b> (Isaiah 41:2).

### Part 22
Apropos Abraham’s miraculous weapons, the Gemara relates: <b>Naḥum of Gam Zo was accustomed that</b> in response to <b>any</b> circumstance <b>that arose in his</b> regard, he <b>would say: This too [<i>gam zo</i>] is for the best. One day the Jewish people sought to send a gift [<i>doron</i>] to the emperor. They said: With</b>
