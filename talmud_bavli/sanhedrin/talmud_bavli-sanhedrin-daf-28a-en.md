### Part 1
§ The Gemara resumes its discussion of the source for the disqualification of relatives from bearing witness. From the fact that the verse: “The fathers shall not be put to death for the children” (Deuteronomy 24:16), is not phrased in the singular, i.e., A father shall not be put to death for his child, it is derived that not only are a father and child disqualified from bearing witness about one another, but closely related relatives, i.e., brothers, are also disqualified from bearing witness about each other’s children. Consequently, <b>we found</b> a source for the disqualification of <b>fathers</b> from bearing witness <b>about</b> their <b>children</b> or the children of their brothers, <b>and</b> for the disqualification of <b>children</b> from bearing witness <b>about</b> their <b>fathers</b> or their fathers’ brothers.

### Part 2
<b>And all the more so,</b> the related <b>fathers,</b> e.g., brothers, are disqualified from bearing witness <b>about each other,</b> as they are certainly more closely related to each other than are a nephew and an uncle.

### Part 3
But <b>from where do we</b> derive that one brother’s <b>children</b> cannot bear witness <b>about</b> the <b>children</b> of the other brother?

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> if the children of one brother can bear witness about the children of the other brother, <b>let the verse write: The fathers shall not be put to death for the child.</b> For <b>what</b> reason is <b>“children”</b> written, in the plural? It is derived from here <b>that even children</b> of brothers are disqualified from bearing witness <b>about each other.</b>

### Part 5
<b>We found</b> a source for the <i>halakha</i> that the <b>children</b> of brothers cannot bear witness <b>about each other. From where do we</b> derive that the <b>children</b> of brothers cannot bear witness together <b>about others?</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rami bar Ḥama says:</b> This <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> based on <b>logical reasoning,</b> and is not derived from a verse. This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The witnesses are not rendered conspiring</b> witnesses <b>unless they are both rendered conspiring</b> witnesses. <b>And</b> therefore, <b>if it enters your mind</b> that related <b>children are fit</b> to bear witness together <b>about others, a conspiring witness</b> can be <b>found to be executed based on the testimony of his brother,</b> i.e., his relative. Since a conspiring witness is executed for his testimony only if his co-witness is also rendered a conspiring witness, the testimony of his co-witness, who is a relative, is what causes him to be executed. This is tantamount to relatives bearing witness about each other. Therefore, relatives cannot serve as witnesses together.

### Part 7
<b>Rava said to him: But according to your reasoning,</b> there is a difficulty arising from <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Batra</i> 56b): If one occupied land for three years, this serves in court as proof that he is the legal owner. If <b>three brothers</b> testify to his three-year possession of the land, with each one testifying separately about one year, <b>and one</b> unrelated individual <b>joins with</b> each of the brothers as the second witness, <b>these are</b> considered <b>three</b> distinct <b>testimonies</b> and are therefore accepted by the court. If they were to be considered one testimony it would not be accepted, as brothers may not testify together. <b>But they are</b> considered <b>one testimony for</b> the purpose of rendering them <b>conspiring</b> witnesses. In other words, they are punished only if all six of the witnesses are rendered conspiring witnesses, and the liability is divided among them.

### Part 8
Rava states his objection: If so, <b>a conspiring witness</b> can be <b>found</b> to be <b>paying money due to the testimony of his brother,</b> and nevertheless, the brothers’ testimony is not disqualified.

### Part 9
<b>Rather,</b> this is clearly not considered tantamount to brothers bearing witness about each other, as the <b>rendering</b> of one as <b>a conspiring witness comes</b> not from his co-witness but <b>from others,</b> i.e., the witnesses who testify that he had been with them. <b>Here too,</b> it cannot be proven logically that relatives are disqualified from bearing witness together, as the <b>rendering</b> of one as <b>a conspiring witness comes from others.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> that relatives are disqualified from bearing witness together is derived from a different source: <b>If</b> it is <b>so</b> that relatives can bear witness together, <b>let the verse write: And a child</b> shall not be put to death <b>for the fathers, or: They</b> shall not be put to death <b>for the fathers.</b> For <b>what</b> reason is <b>“and the children”</b> written in the plural? This indicates that related <b>children</b> are disqualified from bearing witness <b>even about others.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>We found</b> a source for the disqualification of <b>paternal relatives. From where do we</b> derive the disqualification of <b>maternal relatives?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states “fathers,” “fathers,”</b> i.e., it states the word <b>twice.</b> This repetition is unnecessary, as the verse could have stated: And the children shall not be put to death for them. <b>If</b> the superfluous word “fathers” <b>is not</b> needed to teach the <b>matter of paternal relatives,</b> as this matter was already derived from the verse, <b>apply it</b> to the <b>matter of maternal relatives.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>We found</b> a source for the <i>halakha</i> that one cannot bear witness <b>to</b> the <b>detriment</b> of his relative, as the verse states: “Shall not be put to death.” <b>From where do we</b> derive that one cannot testify <b>to</b> the <b>benefit</b> of his relative?

### Part 13
The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states</b> the term <b>“shall</b> not <b>be put to death,” “shall</b> not <b>be put to death,” twice. If</b> it <b>is not</b> needed to teach the <b>matter</b> of testimony <b>to</b> the <b>detriment</b> of one’s relative, as this <i>halakha</i> was already derived from the verse, <b>apply it</b> to the <b>matter of</b> testimony <b>to</b> the <b>benefit</b> of one’s relative.

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>We found</b> a source for the disqualification of relatives <b>in</b> cases of <b>capital law,</b> as the verse is referring to execution. <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i> <b>in</b> cases of <b>monetary law?</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states: “You shall have one manner of law”</b> (Leviticus 24:22), which is interpreted to mean: <b>A law that is equal for you.</b> In other words, monetary law and capital law essentially follow the same guidelines.

### Part 16
§ <b>Rav says: My paternal uncle will not testify about me,</b> neither <b>he, nor his son, nor his son-in-law,</b> in accordance with the ruling of the mishna. <b>Furthermore, I will not testify about him,</b> neither <b>I, nor my son, nor my son-in-law.</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>And why,</b> for example, can Rav’s son not testify about the brother of his father’s father? But <b>it is</b> the testimony of a member of the <b>third</b> generation <b>with regard to</b> a related member of the <b>first</b> generation, as there is a two-generation difference between them. <b>And we learned</b> in the mishna that a member of the <b>second</b> generation cannot testify <b>about</b> a member of the <b>second</b> generation, e.g., one cannot testify about the son of his paternal uncle. <b>We</b> also <b>learned</b> that a member of the <b>second</b> generation cannot testify <b>about</b> a member of the <b>first</b> generation, e.g., one cannot testify about his uncle. But <b>we did not learn</b> that a member of the <b>third</b> generation cannot testify <b>about</b> a member of the <b>first</b> generation.

### Part 18
The Gemara answers: In the statement <b>that is taught in the mishna:</b> They themselves, and their sons, and their sons-in-law are considered relatives, <b>what</b> is the ruling of the mishna concerning <b>his son-in-law</b> referring to? It is referring to <b>the son-in-law of his son.</b> Accordingly, the mishna disqualifies the testimony of a member of the third generation about a member of the first generation.

### Part 19
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>let</b> the mishna <b>teach:</b> And his son and <b>the son of his son,</b> instead of: His son-in-law. This would be a more straightforward manner of conveying the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a member of the third generation testifying about a member of the first generation.

### Part 20
The Gemara answers: By mentioning his son-in-law, the mishna <b>teaches us a matter in passing: That</b> with regard to the different levels of familial relationships, <b>a husband is like his wife.</b> Therefore, there is no difference between one’s son and one’s son-in-law.

### Part 21
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if the mishna is referring to the son-in-law of his son, a difficulty is posed by <b>that which Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Eight fathers,</b> i.e., eight principal relatives mentioned in the mishna, are disqualified, <b>which are twenty-four</b> including the son and son-in-law of each. If the mishna is referring to one’s grandson <b>these are thirty-two,</b> as the son, the son-in-law, and the grandson of each are included.

### Part 22
The Gemara consequently rejects the explanation that the mishna is referring to the son-in-law of one’s son: <b>Rather,</b> the mishna is <b>in fact</b> referring to <b>his actual son-in-law. And why does</b> Rav <b>refer to him as the son-in-law of his son,</b> deriving from this case that a member of the third generation cannot testify about a member of the first generation? <b>Since</b> one’s son-in-law <b>comes from outside</b> the family he is considered a more distant relative than his son, <b>as if</b> he belongs to <b>another generation.</b>

### Part 23
The Gemara challenges this: <b>If that is so,</b> then the testimony of an individual with regard to the son-in-law of his father <b>is</b> equivalent <b>to</b> that of a member of the <b>third</b> generation <b>with regard to</b> a member of the <b>second</b> generation. <b>And Rav</b> is known to have <b>deemed</b> a member of the <b>third</b> generation <b>fit</b> to bear witness <b>about</b> a member of the <b>second</b> generation.

### Part 24
<b>Rather, Rav stated</b> his ruling not in accordance with the mishna, but <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Just as my paternal uncle will not testify about me,</b> neither <b>he, nor his son, nor his son-in-law, so too, the son of my paternal uncle will not testify about me,</b> neither <b>he, nor his son, nor his son-in-law.</b> Accordingly, one cannot testify about the grandchild of his brother.

### Part 25
The Gemara asks: <b>But still,</b> according to Rabbi Elazar, the grandson of one’s uncle cannot testify about his great-great uncle, which <b>is</b> the testimony of a member of the <b>third</b> generation <b>about</b> a member of the <b>second</b> generation; <b>and Rav deemed</b> a member of the <b>third</b> generation <b>fit</b> to bear witness <b>about</b> a member of the <b>second</b> generation.

### Part 26
The Gemara answers: <b>Rav holds in accordance with</b> Rabbi Elazar’s opinion <b>in one</b> case, i.e., he disqualifies testimony of a member of the third generation with regard to a member of the first generation, <b>and he disagrees with him in one</b> case, i.e., he does not disqualify the testimony of a member of the third generation about a member of the second generation.

### Part 27
<b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rav?</b> It is <b>as the verse states: “The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, and the children</b> shall not be put to death for the fathers.” The phrase “for the children, and the children” is interpreted <b>to include another generation,</b> the grandchildren of one’s brother; they are also disqualified.

### Part 28
<b>And Rabbi Elazar</b> derives his opinion from the fact that <b>the Merciful One states: “For the children,”</b> which is interpreted to mean that <b>the ones disqualified</b> from bearing witness <b>about the fathers</b> are <b>cast on the children</b> as well. In other words, anyone who is disqualified from bearing witness about a father is also disqualified from bearing witness about his children.

### Part 29
§ <b>Rav Naḥman says: The brother of my mother-in-law will not testify about me; the son of the brother of my mother-in-law will not testify about me; the son of the sister of my mother-in-law will not testify about me. And the <i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna also <b>taught</b> this <i>halakha</i>: <b>His sister’s husband, and the husband of his father’s sister, and the husband of his mother’s sister,</b> and his mother’s husband, and his father-in-law, and his brother-in-law, <b>they</b> themselves, <b>and their sons, and their sons-in-law.</b> This describes the same familial relationship from the perspective of the younger generation.

### Part 30
<b>Rav Ashi said: When we were in Ulla’s study hall, we were asked:</b> With regard to testifying about <b>the brother of</b> one’s <b>father-in-law, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? With regard to <b>the son of the brother of</b> one’s <b>father-in-law, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? With regard to <b>the son of the sister of</b> one’s <b>father-in-law, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?

### Part 31
And Ulla <b>said to us: You learned</b> the answer to this question in the mishna: <b>His brother, and his paternal uncle, and his maternal uncle,</b> and his mother’s husband, and his father-in-law, and his brother-in-law, <b>they</b> themselves, <b>and their sons, and their sons-in-law.</b> These relationships are the same as those you were asked about, from the perspective of the younger generation.

### Part 32
