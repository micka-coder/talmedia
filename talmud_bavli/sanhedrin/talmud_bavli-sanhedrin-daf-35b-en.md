### Part 1
<b>and he heard that</b> a relative <b>of his died,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he should</b> return and <b>become ritually impure</b> with the impurity imparted by a corpse to bury his relative. <b>You said: “He shall not make himself impure”;</b> the death of his relative will not override so significant a mitzva from the Torah.

### Part 2
One <b>might</b> have thought: <b>Just as he may not become impure to</b> bury <b>his sister, so he may not become impure to</b> bury <b>a <i>met mitzva</i>.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> specifically: <b>“Or for his sister”;</b> teaching that <b>he may not become impure</b> only <b>to</b> bury <b>his sister,</b> as others can attend to her burial, <b>but he may become impure to</b> bury <b>a <i>met mitzva</i>.</b>

### Part 3
Having cited the <i>baraita</i> proving that the burial of a <i>met mitzva</i> overrides the Temple service, Reish Lakish continues his suggestion: With regard to <b>Shabbat, which is overridden due to</b> the Temple <b>service, is it not logical that the burial of a <i>met mitzva</i> overrides it?</b>

### Part 4
Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him:</b> The <i>halakha</i> of <b>murder,</b> i.e., the obligation to kill one found liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment, <b>proves</b> that this is not the case, <b>as</b> it <b>overrides</b> the Temple <b>service,</b> e.g., if the only priest present is liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment, he is taken to be killed despite this resulting in the negation of the Temple service, <b>but it does not override Shabbat.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>Murder itself should override Shabbat based on</b> this <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>Just as</b> with regard to the Temple <b>service, which overrides Shabbat,</b> nevertheless <b>murder overrides it,</b> and the source for this is <b>as it is stated:</b> “And if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbor, to slay him with guile; <b>you shall take him from My altar, that he may die”</b> (Exodus 21:14); then with regard to <b>Shabbat, which is overridden due to</b> the Temple <b>service, is it not logical that murder should override it?</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rava said</b> in response: <b>It has already been ruled by a <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael, as the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “You shall kindle no fire</b> throughout your habitations on Shabbat day” (Exodus 35:3)? All labor is forbidden on Shabbat, based on the verse: “In it you shall not do any manner of work” (Exodus 20:10). Why is kindling fire singled out?

### Part 7
The Gemara interjects: <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> this? <b>If</b> this question is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> this transgression <b>was singled out to</b> teach that one who lights a fire on Shabbat violates an ordinary <b>prohibition,</b> as opposed to the performance of other types of labor on Shabbat, for which one is liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment. <b>If</b> this question is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Natan,</b> this transgression <b>was singled out to divide</b> the various labors and to establish liability to receive court-imposed capital punishment for performance of any one of them. The Gemara explains: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Kindling of fire was singled out to</b> teach that one who lights a fire on Shabbat violates an ordinary <b>prohibition,</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei. Rabbi Natan says: It was singled out to divide</b> the various labors. Either way, it is clear what the meaning of the verse is.

### Part 8
The Gemara clarifies: <b>Rather, Rava said:</b> The term <b>“habitations”</b> in the verse poses a <b>difficulty for</b> the <b><i>tanna</i>: What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states:</b> “You shall kindle no fire throughout your <b>habitations</b> on Shabbat day”? <b>After all, Shabbat is an obligation on the</b> person <b>himself,</b> not an obligation bound to any specific location. <b>And</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>an obligation on the</b> person <b>himself is practiced whether in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>or outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael. <b>Why do I</b> need the term <b>“habitations” that the Merciful One writes</b> in the Torah?

### Part 9
Rava continues: <b>One student said in the name of Rabbi Yishmael</b> that <b>since it is stated:</b> “And <b>if there is in a man a sin deserving of death and he is put to death”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:22), <b>I</b> would <b>derive</b> that the court administers capital punishment <b>both during the week and on Shabbat. And</b> accordingly, <b>how do I realize</b> the meaning of what the verse states concerning Shabbat: <b>“Everyone that desecrates it shall be put to death”</b> (Exodus 31:14)? One possibility is that the term: Desecration of Shabbat, applies only <b>to other</b> cases in which <b>labor</b> is performed, and <b>excludes</b> instances of <b>the death</b> penalty administered by <b>a court,</b> which is not a desecration of Shabbat. <b>Or rather,</b> derive that <b>even the death</b> penalty administered by <b>a court</b> is prohibited as desecration of Shabbat. <b>And how do I realize</b> the meaning of: <b>“And he is put to death”?</b> One possibility is that the mitzva of executing transgressors applies <b>on weekdays, but not on Shabbat. Or rather,</b> the other possibility is that it applies <b>even on Shabbat.</b>

### Part 10
As these verses can be interpreted in either manner, <b>the verse states: “You shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations</b> on Shabbat day,” <b>and there,</b> with regard to the punishment administered to a murderer, the verse <b>states: “And these shall be for you a statute of judgment throughout your generations in all your habitations”</b> (Numbers 35:29). <b>Just as</b> the term <b>“habitations” that is stated there</b> is referring to the act of <b>a court, so too</b> the term <b>“habitations” that is stated here</b> concerning Shabbat is referring to the act of <b>a court. And the Merciful One states: “You shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations.”</b> This teaches that the court does not administer capital punishment on Shabbat.

### Part 11
<b>Abaye says: Now that you have said</b> that <b>murder</b> of one condemned by the court <b>does not override Shabbat,</b> one should say that <b>murder does not override</b> the performance of <b>the</b> Temple <b>service</b> either, <b>based on an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>And just as</b> with regard to <b>Shabbat, which is overridden for</b> the performance of <b>the</b> Temple <b>service, murder does not override it,</b> then with regard to performance of the Temple <b>service, which overrides Shabbat, is it not logical that murder should not override it?</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara questions this inference: <b>But</b> if so, how would one explain <b>that which is written</b> in the verse concerning one liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment: <b>“You shall take him from My altar, that he may die”</b> (Exodus 21:14)? This verse indicates that the court administering capital punishment does override the performance of the Temple service. The Gemara explains: <b>That</b> verse serves to teach the <i>halakha</i> <b>concerning an offering of an individual, which does not override Shabbat.</b> The verse is teaching that the court takes the priest to execute him even if this will result in the offering of an individual not being sacrificed.

### Part 13
<b>Rava says: If that is so,</b> one should say that <b>murder should not override</b> even <b>an offering of an individual based on an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference:
