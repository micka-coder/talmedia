### Part 1
or <b>one who engages in intercourse with an animal, whether in a typical manner or in an atypical manner,</b> i.e., anal intercourse, <b>and</b> similarly <b>a woman who engages in intercourse with an animal, whether in a typical manner or in an atypical manner,</b> is <b>liable.</b> This <i>baraita</i> sets the minimum age for the passive male at nine years and one day.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Rav Ḥisda taught: With regard to a woman</b> there are <b>two</b> manners of <b>lying.</b> A woman who engages in intercourse with an animal, whether it is vaginal or anal intercourse, is liable. <b>But with regard to</b> a man who engages in intercourse with <b>an animal</b> there is only <b>one</b> manner of <b>lying,</b> i.e., vaginal intercourse.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Pappa objects to this</b> opinion: <b>On the contrary, a woman, whose typical manner</b> of intercourse <b>is</b> vaginal, <b>is rendered liable for lying</b> with an animal only in that manner; she <b>is not rendered liable for something else,</b> i.e., for engaging in anal intercourse with an animal. With regard to a man who engages in intercourse with <b>an animal,</b> by contrast, <b>since it is not its typical</b> conduct to engage in intercourse with a man, he <b>should be rendered liable for</b> engaging in intercourse with <b>it through each and every orifice.</b>

### Part 4
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with neither of their</b> opinions: One who engages in homosexual intercourse with <b>a male aged nine years and one day,</b> or <b>one who engages in intercourse with an animal, whether in a typical manner, or in an atypical manner,</b> i.e., anal intercourse, <b>and</b> similarly, <b>a woman who engages in intercourse with an animal, whether in a typical manner or in an atypical manner,</b> are <b>liable.</b> Evidently, there is no difference between the nature of the transgression of a woman who engages in bestiality and a man who engages in bestiality in this regard.

### Part 5
<b>Ravina said to Rava:</b> With regard to <b>one who performs the initial stage of intercourse with</b> another <b>male,</b> i.e., insertion of the penis, without completing the intercourse, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is he liable for engaging in homosexual intercourse?

### Part 6
The Gemara comments: With regard to <b>one who performs the initial stage of intercourse with a male,</b> what is the question? The expression <b>“as with a woman”</b> (Leviticus 18:22) <b>is written with regard to him,</b> which indicates that any act that is considered an act of intercourse with a woman is also considered an act of intercourse with a man. <b>Rather,</b> the question is as follows: With regard to <b>one who performs the initial stage of intercourse with an animal, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?

### Part 7
Rava <b>said to him:</b> In the verse: “And you shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother’s sister nor of your father’s sister; for he has made naked [<i>he’era</i>] his relative” (Leviticus 20:19), the word <i>he’era</i> alludes to the initial stage of intercourse [<i>ha’ara</i>]. <b>If</b> the word <i>he’era</i> <b>is not</b> needed for the <b>matter of the initial stage of intercourse</b> in the context <b>where it is written,</b> i.e., for the prohibition of intercourse with one’s <b>father’s sister and</b> one’s <b>mother’s sister, as it is not necessary</b> in that context since the <i>halakha</i> of the initial stage of intercourse with regard to all forbidden sexual relations is <b>compared</b> by the Torah <b>to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the initial stage of intercourse</b> mentioned <b>with regard to a menstruating woman, apply it</b> instead <b>to</b> the <b>matter of the initial stage of intercourse with an animal.</b> The superfluous expression that appears in the verse concerning one’s aunt teaches that the initial stage of intercourse is considered intercourse even with regard to an animal.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>Since</b> one who engages in intercourse with <b>an animal is among those who are liable</b> to receive <b>a</b> court-imposed <b>death</b> penalty, <b>why do I</b> need the <i>halakha</i> of one who performs the <b>initial stage of intercourse with</b> an animal <b>to be written</b> in a verse <b>concerning those who are liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i>,</b> i.e., the case of one who engages in intercourse with his aunt? <b>Let</b> the Torah <b>write</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to those who are liable</b> to receive <b>a</b> court-imposed <b>death</b> penalty, <b>and</b> one would then <b>derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>those who are liable</b> to receive <b>a</b> court-imposed <b>death</b> penalty <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>those who are liable</b> to receive <b>a</b> court-imposed <b>death</b> penalty, and not from the less relevant <i>halakha</i> of one who engages in intercourse with his aunt, who is punished with <i>karet</i>.

### Part 9
The Gemara answers: <b>Since the entire verse</b> about the punishment of one who engages in intercourse with the sister of his father or mother is superfluous, and <b>comes for</b> the sake of <b>exposition,</b> as this <i>halakha</i> is already stated in other verses (see Leviticus 18:12–13), this <b>matter,</b> i.e., the fact that the initial stage of intercourse is halakhically defined as intercourse, <b>is also written</b> in this verse for the purpose <b>of an exposition,</b> i.e., in order to indicate that this principle holds true with regard to bestiality as well.

### Part 10
<b>Rav Aḥadevoi bar Ami asked Rav Sheshet:</b> With regard to <b>one who performs the initial stage of</b> homosexual <b>intercourse on himself, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is he liable for homosexual intercourse? Rav Sheshet <b>said to him: You disgust me</b> with your question; such an act is not possible.

### Part 11
<b>Rav Ashi said: What is your dilemma?</b> With regard to doing so <b>with an erect</b> penis, <b>you cannot find</b> such a case. <b>You can find it</b> only <b>when</b> one <b>performs</b> this <b>act of intercourse</b> with <b>a flaccid</b> penis. And the <i>halakha</i> is subject to a dispute: <b>According to the one who says</b> that a man <b>who engages in intercourse</b> with <b>a flaccid</b> penis, <b>with</b> one of <b>those with whom relations are forbidden,</b> is <b>exempt,</b> as that is not considered intercourse, <b>here</b> too, when one does so to himself, he is <b>exempt. And according to the one who says</b> that he is <b>liable,</b> he is <b>rendered liable here</b> for transgressing <b>two</b> prohibitions according to Rabbi Yishmael; he is <b>rendered liable for engaging in</b> homosexual <b>intercourse</b> actively, <b>and</b> he is <b>rendered liable for engaging in</b> homosexual <b>intercourse</b> passively.

### Part 12
The students <b>asked Rav Sheshet:</b> With regard to <b>a gentile who engages in intercourse with an animal, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Must the animal be killed? The Gemara elaborates: <b>Do we need</b> two reasons to kill the animal, namely that it caused <b>a calamity and</b> that it caused <b>shame, and</b> therefore <b>here</b> the animal is not killed, as while <b>there is a calamity,</b> as it caused a person to sin and be executed, <b>there is no shame,</b> as the Jewish court is not responsible for the shame of a gentile? <b>Or perhaps</b> one reason is enough, and an animal is killed because of the <b>calamity</b> it caused <b>even if there is no shame?</b>

### Part 13
<b>Rav Sheshet said: You learned</b> the answer to this question in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If</b> with regard to <b>trees, which neither eat nor drink nor smell,</b> and nevertheless, if they are used in idolatrous rites, <b>the Torah says: Destroy, burn, and demolish</b> them (see Deuteronomy, chapters 7, 12), and the reason is <b>since a calamity was caused to people by them,</b> then with regard to one <b>who leads another astray from the ways of life to the ways of death, all the more so</b> he is liable to be destroyed. It can be derived from here that any item used for a transgression that renders one liable to be executed should be destroyed.

### Part 14
The Gemara challenges this ruling: <b>If that is so,</b> in the case of <b>a gentile who bows down to his animal,</b> the animal <b>should be forbidden,</b> i.e., it should be prohibited to derive benefit from it, <b>and it should be killed.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Is there anything that is not forbidden to a Jew, but is forbidden to a gentile?</b> Since a Jew who bows down to an animal does not render it forbidden (see <i>Temura</i> 29b), a gentile who does so does not render it forbidden either.

### Part 15
The Gemara challenges that assumption: With regard to <b>a Jew himself</b> who bows down to his animal, <b>let</b> the animal <b>be forbidden, just as it is in</b> a case of <b>bestiality,</b> when the animal is forbidden and is killed. <b>Abaye says:</b> The cases are not the same. In <b>this</b> case, where one commits bestiality, <b>his shame is great; but</b> in <b>that</b> case, where one worships an animal, <b>his shame is slight,</b> and he will not be so disgraced if the animal is left alive.

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> with regard to <b>trees</b> that are used in idolatrous rites, in <b>which</b> case <b>the shame of</b> the idol worshippers <b>is not great, the Torah</b> nevertheless <b>says: Destroy, burn, and demolish</b> them. The Gemara answers: <b>We are speaking of living animals.</b> The <i>halakha</i> is different there, <b>as the Merciful One has pity on them.</b> Therefore, if the shame of the person is not great, the animal is not killed.

### Part 17
<b>Rava says</b> that there is a different reason for the distinction between an animal that was worshipped and an animal with which one committed bestiality: <b>The Torah states</b> that because the <b>animal enjoyed</b> the <b>transgression, it must be killed.</b> This cannot be said about an animal that was worshipped.

### Part 18
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> with regard to <b>trees</b> that are used in idolatrous rites, <b>which do not enjoy</b> the <b>transgression,</b> nevertheless <b>the Torah says: Destroy, burn, and demolish.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>We are speaking of living animals.</b> The <i>halakha</i> is different there, <b>as the Merciful One has pity on them.</b> Therefore, an animal is killed only if it enjoyed the transgression.

### Part 19
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from the mishna to the dilemma concerning an animal with which a gentile committed bestiality: <b>Alternatively,</b> it is <b>so that</b> this <b>animal will not pass through the marketplace, and</b> those who see it <b>will say: This is</b> the animal <b>because of which so-and-so was stoned,</b> and its existence would shame his memory. <b>What, is it not</b>
