### Part 1
<b>were relatives</b> of his <b>and became not related</b> to him, as Mar Ukva’s wife, who was their sister, died. <b>They came before him for judgment.</b> Mar Ukva <b>said to them: I am disqualified from adjudicating for you.</b>

### Part 2
<b>They said to</b> Mar Ukva: <b>What is your opinion</b> according to which you disqualify yourself? Do you rule <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> that since you have children we are still relatives? <b>We shall bring a letter from the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>that</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b>

### Part 3
Mar Ukva <b>said to them: Is that to say</b> that <b>I am stuck to you with a <i>kav</i> of wax [<i>kira</i>]?</b> I agree <b>that</b> we are not considered relatives; <b>I am saying that I am disqualified from adjudicating for you only because you will not obey the verdict,</b> and I do not wish to participate in such judgment.

### Part 4
§ The mishna teaches that according to Rabbi Yehuda, one who loves or one who hates one of the litigants is disqualified from bearing witness. One who <b>loves</b> one of the litigants; <b>this</b> is referring to <b>his groomsman.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> for <b>how long</b> is the groomsman disqualified? <b>Rabbi Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yirmeya says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> Throughout <b>all of the seven days of feasting. And the Rabbis say in the name of Rava: Even from the first day</b> after the wedding <b>and onward</b> he is no longer disqualified; he is disqualified only on the wedding day itself.

### Part 6
§ The mishna teaches: <b>One who hates</b> the litigant is referring to <b>anyone</b> who, out of enmity, <b>did not speak</b> with the litigant for three days. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: This <i>halakha</i> is derived from the verse: “And he was not his enemy, neither sought his harm” (Numbers 35:23), that one about whom it can be stated: <b>“And he was not his enemy,” can testify about him.</b> And one who <b>“neither sought his harm” can judge him.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>We found</b> a source for the disqualification of one who <b>hates; from where do we</b> derive that one who <b>loves</b> is disqualified?

### Part 8
The Gemara answers that one should <b>read into</b> the verse <b>like this:</b> One about whom it can be stated: <b>And he who was not his enemy nor one who loves him, can testify about him;</b> and one who <b>neither sought his harm nor his favor can judge him.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>Is: One who loves, written</b> in the verse? How can the verse be read in this manner? <b>Rather,</b> the extension of the disqualification to one who loves him as well <b>is</b> based on <b>logical reasoning: What is the reason an enemy</b> is disqualified from bearing witness? It is <b>because he feels a sense of aversion</b> toward that individual and might testify falsely against him. A similar logic can be employed with regard to one who <b>loves, as well: He feels a sense of affinity</b> toward that individual, and might testify falsely on his behalf.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>And what do the Rabbis,</b> who do not agree with Rabbi Yehuda, <b>derive from this</b> verse: <b>“And he was not his enemy, neither sought his harm”?</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: <b>One</b> part of the verse is necessary <b>for</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>a judge</b> who loves or hates one of the litigants is disqualified. The Rabbis agree with this <i>halakha</i>, as such a judge is naturally inclined to favor one of the litigants.

### Part 12
<b>The other</b> part of the verse is interpreted <b>in accordance with that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says:</b> With regard to the verse <b>“And he was not his enemy, neither sought his harm,”</b> it is derived <b>from here that two Torah scholars who hate each other cannot sit in judgment</b> together <b>as one.</b> Because of their hatred they will come to contradict each other’s rulings unjustly.

### Part 13
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>How do</b> the judges <b>examine the witnesses? They bring them into a room</b> in the courthouse <b>and intimidate them</b> so that they will speak only the truth. <b>And they take all the people,</b> other than the judges, <b>outside</b> so that they should not tell the other witnesses the questions the judges ask and the answers the first witness gives, <b>and they leave</b> only <b>the eldest of</b> the witnesses to testify first.

### Part 14
<b>And they say to him: Say how</b> exactly <b>you know that this</b> litigant <b>owes money to that</b> litigant, as the plaintiff claims. <b>If he said:</b> The defendant <b>said to me:</b> It is true <b>that I owe</b> the plaintiff, or if he says: <b>So-and-so said to me that</b> the defendant <b>owes</b> the plaintiff, the witness <b>has said nothing</b> and his testimony is disregarded. It is not valid testimony <b>unless he says:</b> The defendant <b>admitted in our presence to</b> the plaintiff <b>that he owes him,</b> e.g., <b>two hundred dinars.</b> By admitting to the debt in the presence of witnesses he renders himself liable to pay the amount that he mentioned.

### Part 15
<b>And afterward they bring in the second</b> witness <b>and examine him</b> in the same manner. <b>If their statements are found to be congruent</b> the judges then <b>discuss the matter.</b>

### Part 16
If the opinions of the judges are divided, as <b>two</b> judges <b>say</b> that the defendant is <b>exempt</b> from payment <b>and one says</b> he is <b>liable</b> to pay, he is <b>exempt.</b> If <b>two say</b> he is <b>liable and one says</b> he is <b>exempt,</b> he is <b>liable.</b> If <b>one says</b> he is <b>liable and one says</b> he is <b>exempt,</b> or <b>even</b> if <b>two</b> of the judges <b>deem</b> him <b>exempt or two</b> of them <b>deem</b> him <b>liable, and</b> the other <b>one says: I do not know,</b> the court <b>must add</b> more <b>judges</b> and then rule in accordance with the majority opinion. This is because the one who abstains is considered as though he is not a member of the court.

### Part 17
After the judges <b>finish the matter</b> and reach a decision, <b>they bring in</b> the litigants. <b>The greatest of the judges says: So-and-so, you are exempt</b> from paying; or: <b>So-and-so, you are liable</b> to pay.

### Part 18
<b>And from where</b> is it derived that <b>when</b> the judge <b>leaves</b> the courtroom <b>he may not say: I deemed</b> you <b>exempt and my colleagues deemed</b> you <b>liable, but what can I do, as my colleagues outnumbered me</b> and consequently you were deemed liable? <b>About this it is stated: “You shall not go as a talebearer among your people”</b> (Leviticus 19:16), <b>and it says: “One who goes about as a talebearer reveals secrets,</b> but one who is of a faithful spirit conceals a matter” (Proverbs 11:13).

### Part 19
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that the judges intimidate the witnesses. The Gemara asks: <b>What do we say to them? Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>this</b> is what <b>we say to them:</b> It is stated: <b>“As clouds and wind without rain, so is he who boasts himself of a false gift”</b> (Proverbs 25:14). In other words, there will be no rain and no blessing from your deeds if you lie.

### Part 20
<b>Rava said to him:</b> If so, false witnesses <b>can say</b> to themselves that they do not have to worry about this punishment, according to the folk saying: <b>Seven years there was a famine, but over the craftsman’s door it did not pass.</b> If the witnesses are not farmers, they do not need to worry over lack of rain. Consequently, they will disregard this concern.

### Part 21
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> that <b>we say</b> this verse <b>to them: “As a hammer, and a sword, and a sharp arrow, so is a man who bears false witness against his neighbor”</b> (Proverbs 25:18), meaning that a false witness will die prematurely.

### Part 22
<b>Rav Ashi said to him:</b> Here too, false witnesses <b>can say</b> to themselves a folk saying: <b>Seven years there was a pestilence, but a man</b> who has <b>not</b> reached <b>his years did not die;</b> everyone dies at his predestined time. Therefore, they will disregard this concern as well.

### Part 23
The Gemara presents another suggestion: <b>Rather, Rav Ashi said: Natan bar Mar Zutra said to me</b> that <b>we say to them</b> that <b>false witnesses are belittled</b> even <b>by those who hire them,</b> and all the more so by others; <b>as it is written</b> that Jezebel said when she ordered witnesses to be hired to testify against Naboth: <b>“And set two men, base fellows, before him, and let them bear witness against him, saying: You cursed God and the king”</b> (I Kings 21:10). Even Jezebel, who gave the orders to hire them, called them “base fellows.”

### Part 24
§ The mishna teaches that <b>if</b> the witness <b>said:</b> The defendant <b>said to me:</b> It is true that I owe him, his testimony is disregarded <b>unless he says:</b> The defendant <b>admitted in our presence to</b> the plaintiff <b>that he owes him two hundred dinars.</b>

### Part 25
The Gemara comments: <b>This supports</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yehuda, as Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The debtor <b>needs to say</b> to the witnesses to the loan or in his admission that he owes the creditor: <b>You are my witnesses.</b> Otherwise, their testimony is not valid.

### Part 26
<b>It was also stated</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If one said to another: <b>I</b> have <b>one hundred dinars in your possession,</b> i.e., you owe me one hundred dinars, and the other <b>said to him: Yes,</b> and <b>the next day</b> the claimant <b>said to him: Give it to me,</b> if the other then <b>said</b> to him: <b>I was teasing you,</b> i.e., I did not mean it seriously when I said that I owed it to you, the respondent is <b>exempt.</b>

### Part 27
<b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one said to another: <b>I</b> have <b>one hundred dinars in your possession,</b> and the other <b>said to him: Yes,</b> and <b>the next day</b> the claimant <b>said to him: Give it to me,</b> if the other then <b>said to him: I was teasing you,</b> the respondent is <b>exempt.</b>

### Part 28
<b>And moreover,</b> the respondent is exempt <b>even</b> in a case where the claimant <b>hid witnesses for</b> the respondent <b>behind a fence</b> so that the respondent would not see them, <b>and said to him: I</b> have <b>one hundred dinars in your possession,</b> and the respondent <b>said to him: Yes,</b> and the claimant then said to him: <b>Do you wish to admit</b> the debt <b>in the presence of so-and-so and so-and-so?</b> And the respondent <b>said to him: I am afraid</b> to do so, <b>lest you compel me to</b> go to <b>judgment,</b> where, based on their testimony, you will be given the right to forcibly take the money from me whenever you want. But between you and me, I admit that I owe you. And <b>the next day</b> the claimant <b>said to him: Give me</b> the one hundred dinars that you admitted to owing me, and the respondent <b>said to him: I was teasing you.</b> The respondent is <b>exempt</b> because he can claim that he stated his admission only to appease the claimant temporarily, and did not mean to actually admit to owing the money, as he did not know that there were witnesses present.

### Part 29
<b>But</b> the judges <b>do not advance a claim on behalf of an inciter,</b> i.e., one who is accused of inciting others to idol worship.

### Part 30
The Gemara asks: <b>An inciter? Who mentioned anything about it?</b> This matter was not discussed in the <i>baraita</i>. The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> <b>is incomplete, and this is what it is teaching: If</b> the defendant <b>did not advance a claim</b> that he was teasing the plaintiff, the judges <b>do not advance</b> this <b>claim for him.</b> Apparently, he stated his admission seriously. <b>But in</b> cases of <b>capital law, even if</b> the defendant <b>did not advance</b> any <b>claim</b> on his own behalf, the judges <b>advance a claim on his behalf. But</b> the judges <b>do not advance claims on behalf of an inciter.</b>

### Part 31
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>an inciter,</b> that the court does not seek to deem him innocent? <b>Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina says: I heard at the lecture of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba</b> that <b>an inciter is different, as the Merciful One states</b> concerning him: <b>“Neither shall you spare, neither shall you conceal him”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:9). In this unique case, the court is not required to try to deem him innocent.

### Part 32
<b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the judges <b>do not advance a claim on behalf of an inciter?</b> It is derived <b>from</b> the incident of <b>the primordial snake</b> who tempted Eve; he was the first inciter. <b>As Rabbi Simlai says: The snake could have advanced many claims</b> on its own behalf, <b>but it did not claim</b> them. <b>And for what</b> reason <b>did the Holy One, Blessed be He, not advance</b> these <b>claims for it,</b> deeming the snake exempt from punishment? <b>Because</b> the snake <b>did not advance</b> these <b>claims itself.</b>

### Part 33
The Gemara asks: <b>What could he have said?</b> The Gemara answers: The snake could have said that it is not to blame, as when there is a contradiction between <b>the statement of the teacher and the statement of the student, whose statement should one listen to? One should listen to the statement of the teacher.</b> Since God instructed Adam and Eve not to eat from the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, Adam and Eve should have heeded God’s words and not those of the snake.

### Part 34
<b>Ḥizkiyya says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that anyone who adds, subtracts?</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated</b> that Eve said: <b>“God has said: You shall not eat of it, neither shall you touch it”</b> (Genesis 3:3), whereas God had actually rendered prohibited only eating from the tree but not touching it, as it is stated: “But of the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat of it” (Genesis 2:17). Because Eve added that there was a prohibition against touching the tree, the snake showed her that touching it does not cause her to die, and she consequently sinned by eating from it as well.

### Part 35
<b>Rav Mesharshiyya says</b> that the idea that one who adds, subtracts can also be proven <b>from here: “Two cubits [<i>amatayim</i>] and a half shall be its length”</b> (Exodus 25:10). Without the letter <i>alef</i> at the beginning of the word <i>amatayim</i>, it would be read <i>matayim</i>, which would mean two hundred cubits. The addition of the <i>alef</i> therefore reduces this term to only two cubits.

### Part 36
<b>Rav Ashi says</b> another example: In the verse: <b>“Eleven [<i>ashtei esrei</i>] curtains”</b> (Exodus 26:7), without the letter <i>ayin</i> at the beginning of the phrase it would read <i>shtei esrei</i>, twelve. Therefore, the additional letter <i>ayin</i> reduces the amount from twelve to eleven.

### Part 37
<b>Abaye says:</b> With regard to the case of one who denies a debt to which he admitted in the presence of hidden witnesses, the Sages <b>taught</b> that he is exempt <b>only</b> in a case <b>where he says: I was teasing you. But</b> if <b>he says:</b>
