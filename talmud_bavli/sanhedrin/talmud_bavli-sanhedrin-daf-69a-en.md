### Part 1
<b>And the Merciful One states:</b> “But if the <b>man</b> has no relative,” teaching that it is only in the case of a convert who is <b>a man</b> that <b>you must go around</b> seeking <b>whether or not he has relatives,</b> i.e., children who were born to him after his conversion. But in the case of a convert who is <b>a minor, you do not have to go around</b> searching for relatives; <b>it is known that he has no relative,</b> since a minor cannot father a child.

### Part 2
<b>Abaye raised an objection to</b> Rabba from a <i>baraita</i> discussing a designated maidservant, about whom the verse states: “And if a man lies carnally with a woman who is a maidservant designated to a man, and not fully redeemed, nor freedom given her, inquiry shall be made; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free” (Leviticus 19:20). From the word <b>“man,” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies to an adult <b>man.</b> But as for a minor <b>aged nine years and one day, who is fit for</b> engaging in <b>intercourse, from where</b> is it derived that he too is subject to this <i>halakha</i>? <b>The verse states: “And</b> if <b>a man.”</b> The extraneous letter <i>vav</i>, meaning “and,” serves to include a minor who is nine years old, as already at that age he can perform complete intercourse.

### Part 3
Rabba <b>said to</b> Abaye: There is no proof from here, as even though a nine-year-old boy <b>has</b> sperm, <b>he cannot father</b> a child. His sperm is <b>like</b> the seed of <b>grain that</b> was cut even though it <b>had not</b> yet <b>reached one-third</b> of its growth. Such seed, even if planted, will not grow.

### Part 4
A Sage <b>of the school of Ḥizkiyya taught:</b> The verse states: <b>“But if a man comes intentionally [<i>yazid</i>]</b> against his neighbor, to slay him with guile, you shall take him from My altar, that he may die” (Exodus 21:14). The use of the term <i>yazid</i> in this context and its juxtaposition to the word “man” teaches that <b>a man can heat [<i>mezid</i>]</b> himself up <b>and produce</b> viable <b>sperm, but a minor cannot heat</b> himself up <b>and produce</b> viable <b>sperm.</b> Therefore, even though a minor can engage in full intercourse with a woman, he cannot father a child. <b>Rav Mordekhai said to Rav Ashi: From where may</b> it <b>be inferred that this</b> word <b><i>mezid</i> is a term</b> meaning <b>heating</b> up? <b>As it is written</b> in a different verse: <b>“And Jacob cooked [<i>vayyazed</i>] pottage”</b> (Genesis 25:29).

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t the school of Rabbi Yishmael teach</b> the following <i>baraita</i> concerning a stubborn and rebellious son: The verse that states: “If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son,” teaches that <b>a son</b> can become a stubborn and rebellious son, <b>but not a father,</b> so that one who has a child cannot be sentenced as a stubborn and rebellious son.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances? If we say that</b> his wife <b>conceived after he grew two</b> pubic <b>hairs and</b> the baby <b>was born before he grew a beard around</b> his genitals, <b>is there such a long interval</b> between these two times to allow for carrying the child to term? <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Kruspedai say: The entire time</b> during which it is possible to judge and sentence <b>a stubborn and rebellious son is only three months,</b> the time between the appearance of two pubic hairs and the growth of a beard around the genitals? Consequently, it is impossible for a child to be born to the stubborn and rebellious son during this period. <b>Rather, is it not that</b> his wife <b>conceived before he grew two</b> pubic <b>hairs, and</b> the baby <b>was born before he grew a beard around</b> his genitals? <b>And you can learn from it</b> that <b>a minor can,</b> in fact, <b>father</b> a child.

### Part 7
The Gemara rejects this reasoning: <b>No, actually,</b> you can explain <b>that</b> his wife <b>conceived</b> only <b>after he grew two</b> pubic <b>hairs, and</b> the baby <b>was born after he grew a beard around</b> his genitals. <b>And</b> as for <b>that which</b> is <b>difficult</b> for you based on the statement <b>of Rabbi Kruspedai</b> that the <i>halakha</i> governing a stubborn and rebellious son applies for only three months, it can be explained as follows: <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said</b> that <b>they say in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, that the term “son” teaches that only <b>a son</b> can become a stubborn and rebellious son, <b>but not one who is fit to be called a father.</b> That is to say, the verse does not exclude someone whose child was born during this period, but rather one whose wife conceived during this time, so that he is fit to be called a father.

### Part 8
§ Returning to <b>the</b> matter <b>itself: Rabbi Kruspedai says</b> that <b>Rabbi Shabbtai says: The entire time</b> during which it is possible to judge and sentence <b>a stubborn and rebellious son is only three months.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that a boy can be judged as a stubborn and rebellious son <b>from when he grows two</b> pubic <b>hairs until he grows a beard around</b> his genitals? This seems to indicate that his liability depends on his physical maturity, and not on any specific time period. The Gemara answers: If <b>he grew a beard around</b> his genitals, then <b>even if three months have not passed,</b> he can no longer become liable as a stubborn and rebellious son. And if <b>three months passed,</b> then <b>even if he has not grown</b> a beard <b>around</b> his genitals, he is similarly exempt.

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Ya’akov from Nehar Pekod sat before Ravina and sat and said in the name of Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua: Learn from</b> the statement <b>that Rabbi Kruspedai</b> says that <b>Rabbi Shabbtai says</b> that when a woman <b>gives birth at seven</b> months, <b>her fetus cannot</b> yet <b>be discerned after one-third of her days</b> of pregnancy. In a nine-month pregnancy, the fetus can be discerned after three months, which is one-third of the pregnancy. In the case of a pregnancy that lasts seven months, the fetus cannot be discerned at the end of one-third of the pregnancy, i.e., after two and one-third months, but after three months, as in a standard nine-month pregnancy.

### Part 10
Rabbi Ya’akov explains the inference: <b>As if it enters your mind</b> that when a woman gives birth at seven months, <b>her fetus can</b> already <b>be discerned after one-third of her days</b> of pregnancy, i.e., after two and one-third months, <b>why do I</b> need <b>three</b> months from the time the boy reaches adulthood until the end of the time that he can become liable as a stubborn and rebellious son? A period of <b>two and one-third</b> months should <b>suffice.</b> If he engaged in intercourse with a woman immediately upon reaching adulthood and the intercourse resulted in a seven-month pregnancy, the fetus would be able to be discerned after two and one-third months, and he would be fit to be called a father already from then. From the statement of Rabbi Kruspedai, citing Rabbi Shabbtai, it is clear that the earliest time the fetus can be discerned is after three months of the pregnancy have passed.

### Part 11
Ravina <b>said to</b> Rabbi Ya’akov: <b>Actually, I</b> could <b>say to you</b> that even when a woman gives birth at seven months, <b>her fetus can</b> already <b>be discerned after one-third of her days</b> of pregnancy. But the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a stubborn and rebellious son was not adjusted accordingly because of the principle that one <b>follows the majority.</b> Most women give birth at nine months, and their fetuses are discernible only after three months. Therefore, the fact that one would be fit to be called a father in the case of a seven-month pregnancy is disregarded.

### Part 12
The Sages <b>stated this</b> answer <b>before Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua,</b> whereupon <b>he said to</b> them: <b>But do we</b> blindly <b>follow the majority in</b> cases of <b>capital law</b> and not judge each case on its own merits? Doesn’t <b>the Torah state: “And the congregation shall judge…and the congregation shall deliver”</b> (Numbers 35:24–25), from which it is derived that the court must make every effort to find exculpatory arguments in support of the accused; <b>and</b> yet <b>you say</b> that one <b>follows the majority?</b> If it is possible that already after two and one-third months the stubborn and rebellious son will be fit to be called a father, from that time on he should be exempt from punishment.

### Part 13
The Sages then <b>brought</b> Rav Huna’s analysis <b>back to Ravina</b> and presented it <b>before</b> him. Ravina <b>said to</b> them: <b>And do we not follow the majority in</b> cases of <b>capital law? But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 40a): If <b>one</b> witness <b>says</b> that the event occurred <b>on the second of the month, and one</b> witness <b>says</b> that the event occurred <b>on the third</b> of the month, this is not regarded as a contradiction and <b>their testimony stands,</b> since it is possible to say <b>that this</b> witness <b>knows of</b> the <b>addition of</b> a day to the previous <b>month,</b> and according to his tally the event occurred on the second of the month, <b>and that</b> witness <b>does not know</b> of the addition of a day to the previous month, and according to his tally the event occurred on the third of the month.

### Part 14
<b>And if it enters your mind</b> that <b>we do not say</b> that one <b>follows the majority</b> in cases of capital law, <b>let us</b> then <b>say</b> that <b>these</b> witnesses <b>are testifying with precision, and</b> that <b>they contradict each other,</b> and therefore the accused should be acquitted. <b>Rather, is it not because we say</b> that one <b>follows the majority, and the majority of people are apt to err with regard to the addition</b> of an extra day <b>to the month?</b>

### Part 15
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya of Difti says: We learn</b> in another mishna (<i>Nidda</i> 44b) <b>as well</b> that one follows the majority even in cases of capital law: A girl who is <b>three years and one day old</b> whose father arranged her betrothal <b>can be betrothed with intercourse,</b> as, despite her age, the legal status of intercourse with her is that of full-fledged intercourse. <b>And</b> in a case where the childless husband of a girl three years and one day old dies, <b>if</b> his brother, the <b><i>yavam</i>, engages in intercourse with her, he acquires her</b> as his wife. <b>And</b> if a girl of that age is married, a man other than her husband is <b>liable</b> for engaging in intercourse <b>with her due to</b> violation of the prohibition against adultery, as despite her age she is legally considered to be <b>a married woman.</b>

### Part 16
The mishna continues: <b>And</b> if she is impure due to menstruation, <b>she transmits impurity to one who engages in intercourse with her,</b> who then <b>renders</b> all the items designated for <b>lying beneath</b> him <b>impure like</b> the items designated for lying <b>above</b> him. If <b>she marries a priest, she may partake of <i>teruma</i></b> like any other wife of a priest. If she is unmarried and <b>one</b> of the men <b>who is unfit</b> for the priesthood, e.g., a <i>mamzer</i> or <i>ḥalal</i>, <b>engaged in intercourse with her, he has disqualified her from</b> marrying into <b>the priesthood,</b> and if she is the daughter of a priest, she is disqualified from partaking of <i>teruma</i>. <b>And if one of any of those with whom relations are forbidden, which are enumerated in the Torah, engaged in intercourse with her,</b> e.g., her father or father-in-law, the man is <b>executed by</b> the court for engaging in intercourse with <b>her, and she is exempt</b> because she is a minor.
