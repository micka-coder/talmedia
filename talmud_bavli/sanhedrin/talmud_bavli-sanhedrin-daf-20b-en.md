has <b>its weaving on its inside,</b> in that the straps woven to hold the bedding are tied in holes inside the bed posts, while <b>a bed</b> has <b>its weaving on its outside,</b> in that its straps are tied around the posts.

### Part 2
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 16:1): <b>From when</b> are <b>wooden vessels</b> considered complete and <b>susceptible to impurity?</b> In the case of <b>a bed or a crib,</b> this happens <b>once they are rubbed with fish skin,</b> which smoothens the wood. The Gemara asks: <b>And if a bed is woven on its back side,</b> as Rabbi Yoḥanan claimed, <b>why do I</b> need <b>rubbing with fish skin?</b> Doesn’t the weaving cover the smooth part of the bed? <b>Rather,</b> instead of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s explanation, say that the weaving of both <b>this and that,</b> a <i>dargash</i> and a bed, is <b>on its inside,</b> and the difference between them is that on <b>a bed,</b> the straps <b>go in and out of holes</b> on the posts, whereas on <b>a <i>dargash</i>, they go in and out of loops.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Ya’akov says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</b> that a mourner is not required to overturn a <i>dargash</i>, but only to untie the straps around its posts to let it fall on its own. In connection with this matter <b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Ami says:</b> In the case of <b>a bed whose posts [<i>naklitim</i>]</b> on which the canopy is spread <b>extend,</b> meaning that they are very long, so that the bed will remain high off the ground even if it is overturned, the mourner <b>stands it up</b> in the time of mourning <b>and</b> that <b>is sufficient.</b>

### Part 4
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>And</b> the king <b>brings out</b> people <b>for</b> conscription in <b>an optional war,</b> i.e., a war that is not mandated by the Torah and is not a war of defense, <b>on the basis of a court of seventy-one, and breaches</b> fences of anyone in his way <b>to create a pathway for himself</b>  for his various needs, <b>and no one can protest his power. The pathway of the king has no measure,</b> neither lengthwise nor widthwise, and one cannot protest that this pathway is wider than necessary. <b>And all the people take spoils</b> in war <b>and give</b> them <b>to him, and he takes the first portion</b> of the spoils.

### Part 5
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>We</b> already <b>learn</b> this on <b>another occasion</b> in the mishna (2a): And the king may <b>bring out</b> the nation <b>to an optional war only on the basis of a court of seventy-one</b> judges. Why did the mishna need to repeat it here? The Gemara explains: <b>Since</b> in the mishna here the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught all matters</b> pertaining <b>to the king, he also taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>bringing out</b> the nation <b>to an optional war,</b> although this <i>halakha</i> was taught at the beginning of the tractate in the context of the <i>halakhot</i> of the court of seventy-one judges.

### Part 6
With regard to the king’s rights, the Sages engaged in a dispute: <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> Concerning <b>all</b> the actions <b>that are stated in the</b> biblical <b>passage about</b> the <b>king</b> (see I Samuel 8:11–17), it <b>is permitted</b> for <b>a king to</b> perform <b>them. Rav says: This</b> biblical <b>passage was stated only</b> in order <b>to threaten</b> the Jewish people, so that they would accept the king’s sovereignty with reverence, <b>as it is stated: “You shall set a king over you”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:15), meaning, it is necessary <b>that his fear should be upon you.</b> But the king is not actually permitted to perform the actions stated there.

### Part 7
The Gemara comments that this dispute is <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> Concerning <b>all</b> the actions <b>that are stated in the</b> biblical <b>passage about</b> the <b>king,</b> it <b>is permitted</b> for <b>a king to</b> perform <b>them. Rabbi Yehuda says: This</b> biblical <b>passage was stated only</b> in order <b>to threaten</b> the Jewish people, <b>as it is stated: “You shall set a king over you”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:15), meaning, it is necessary <b>that his fear should be upon you.</b>

### Part 8
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And so would Rabbi Yehuda say: Three mitzvot were commanded</b> to the <b>Jewish people upon their entrance into Eretz</b> Yisrael, which apply only in Eretz Yisrael: They were commanded <b>to establish a king for themselves</b> (see Deuteronomy 17:14–15), <b>and to cut off the seed of Amalek</b> in war (see Deuteronomy 25:17–19), <b>and to build the Chosen House,</b> i.e., the Temple, in Jerusalem (see Deuteronomy 12:10–12).

### Part 9
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Nehorai says: This</b> biblical <b>passage</b> about appointing a king <b>was stated only in response to</b> the Jewish people’s <b>complaint, as it is stated:</b> “When you come unto the land that the Lord your God gives you, and shall possess it, and shall dwell therein, <b>and shall say: I will set a king over me,</b> like all the nations that are around me” (Deuteronomy 17:14). The verse indicates that appointing a king is not a mitzva and that when Samuel spoke to them, he intended to frighten them so that they might regret their complaint and retract their request for a king.

### Part 10
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: The elders of</b> Samuel’s <b>generation asked appropriately, as it is stated: “Give us a king to judge us”</b> (I Samuel 8:6), since they wanted a steady leader in place of Samuel. <b>But the ignoramuses among them ruined</b> it, <b>as it is stated:</b> “But the people refused to heed the voice of Samuel; and they said: No, but there shall be a king over us, <b>that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us, and emerge before us,</b> and fight our battles” (I Samuel 8:19–20).

### Part 11
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Three mitzvot were commanded</b> to the <b>Jewish people upon their entrance into Eretz</b> Yisrael: <b>To establish a king for themselves, and to cut off the seed of Amalek</b> in war, <b>and to build for themselves the Chosen House</b> in Jerusalem. <b>But I do not know which one</b> they are obligated to do <b>first.</b>

### Part 12
<b>When</b> the verse <b>states: “The hand upon the throne [<i>kes</i>] of the Lord: The Lord will have war with Amalek</b> from generation to generation” (Exodus 17:16), <b>you must say</b> that this means they are obligated <b>to establish a king for themselves first,</b> before waging war with Amalek, <b>and</b> the verse is interpreted as follows: <b>“Throne</b> of the Lord” <b>is nothing other than</b> a symbolic name for <b>a king, as it is stated: “Then Solomon sat on the throne [<i>kisei</i>] of the Lord as king”</b> (I Chronicles 29:23), indicating that a king sits on “the throne of the Lord.”

### Part 13
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And still I do not know whether building them the Chosen House is first, or cutting off the seed of Amalek is first,</b> i.e., after the appointing of the king. <b>When</b> the verse <b>states: “And He will give you rest from all your enemies</b> round about, so that you dwell in safety; then <b>it shall come to pass that the place that the Lord</b> your God <b>shall choose</b> to cause His name to dwell there, there shall you bring all that I command you” (Deuteronomy 12:10–11), <b>you must say</b> that the Jewish people were <b>to cut off the seed of Amalek first.</b>

### Part 14
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And so</b> the verse <b>states concerning David: “And it came to pass, when King David dwelled in his house and the Lord had given him rest round about</b> from all his enemies” (II Samuel 7:1). <b>And it is written</b> immediately afterward: <b>“That the king said to Nathan the prophet: See now, I dwell in a house of cedar</b> but the Ark of God dwells within curtains” (II Samuel 7:2), and King David then began seeking a site to build the Temple.

### Part 15
§ The Gemara cites another tradition about Solomon’s kingdom. <b>Reish Lakish says: Initially, Solomon ruled</b> even <b>over the supernal</b> worlds, <b>as it is stated: “Then Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord”</b> (I Chronicles 29:23), indicating that his kingdom was like the Lord’s kingdom, reigning over all worlds. <b>But ultimately,</b> after he married foreign wives, <b>he ruled over</b> only <b>the lower</b> worlds, <b>as it is stated: “For he had dominion over all the region on this side of the river, from Tiphsah even to Gaza”</b> (I Kings 5:4).

### Part 16
<b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagreed with regard to the meaning of this verse: <b>One says</b> that <b>Tiphsah</b> is a name of a place <b>at the end of the world,</b> at one end of Solomon’s kingdom, <b>and Gaza is at the</b> other <b>end of the world. And one says</b> that <b>Tiphsah and Gaza sat next to each other, and</b> the verse serves to teach that <b>just as he ruled over Tiphsah and over Gaza, so he ruled over the whole world.</b>

### Part 17
Reish Lakish continues: <b>And ultimately,</b> Solomon declined further still in that <b>he ruled only over Israel, as it is stated: “I, Koheleth, have been king over Israel</b> in Jerusalem” (Ecclesiastes 1:12). <b>And ultimately, he ruled over only Jerusalem, as it is stated: “The words of Koheleth, the son of David, king in Jerusalem”</b> (Ecclesiastes 1:1). <b>And ultimately, he ruled over only his bed, as it is stated: “Behold, it is the bed of Solomon;</b> threescore mighty men are about it, of the mighty men of Israel” (Song of Songs 3:7).

### Part 18
<b>And ultimately,</b> he declined so much that <b>he ruled over only his staff, as it is stated: “And this was my portion from all of my labor”</b> (Ecclesiastes 2:10). <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagreed with regard to the meaning of this latter verse as well. <b>One says</b> that the term “this” is a reference to <b>his staff, and one says</b> that it is a reference to <b>his cloak.</b>

### Part 19
The Gemara asks: <b>Did he return</b> to reign over the whole world, <b>or did he</b> ultimately <b>not return? Rav and Shmuel</b> disagreed about this: <b>One says</b> that <b>he returned, and one says</b> that <b>he did not return. The one who says</b> that <b>he did not return</b> reasons that Solomon was first <b>a king and</b> then <b>an ordinary</b> person <b>[<i>hedyot</i>]</b> and did not return to his reign; <b>and the one who says</b> that <b>he returned</b> reasons that Solomon was first <b>a king and</b> then <b>an ordinary</b> person <b>and</b> ultimately returned to be <b>a king.</b>

### Part 20
§ The mishna teaches that the king <b>breaches</b> fences of anyone in his way <b>to create a pathway for himself. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Treasures of kings</b> taken as spoils in war belong <b>to the king, and</b> as for <b>the rest of the spoils that are taken</b> in a war, <b>half</b> is <b>for the king and half</b> is <b>for the people. Abaye said to Rav Dimi, and some say</b> that he said this <b>to Rav Aḥa: Granted, treasures of kings</b> belong <b>to the king.</b> This is <b>the typical manner</b> of kings, as it is fitting that the king should use the treasures of the kings he conquers; <b>but</b> with regard to <b>the rest of the spoils that are taken</b> in a war, where <b>half</b> is <b>for the king and half</b> is <b>for the people, from where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? He answered Abaye: The source is <b>as it is written:</b>
