### Part 1
<b>I am certain of myself that I know better</b> than my competitor how to win. <b>But</b> with regard to one who <b>makes it dependent on the decision of his pigeon, say</b> that he is <b>not</b> disqualified from bearing witness, as he is aware that he cannot guarantee the results and therefore resolves to transfer the money if he loses.

### Part 2
<b>And</b> conversely, <b>had</b> the mishna <b>taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> only with regard to one who <b>makes it dependent on the decision of his pigeon,</b> one might assume that only this type of gambler is disqualified, <b>as he</b> presumably <b>says: The matter,</b> i.e., the race, <b>is determined by knocking</b> on trees and other objects to speed up the pigeons, <b>and I know</b> how <b>to knock better</b> than my opponent. Therefore, he does not resolve to transfer the money if he loses. <b>But</b> with regard to one who <b>makes it dependent on his own decision, say</b> that he is <b>not</b> disqualified from bearing witness, as the roll of the dice is pure chance. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> for the mishna to teach both cases.

### Part 3
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion that the expression: Those who fly pigeons, refers to an <i>ara</i>, from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the expression <b>one who plays with dice, these are ones who play with <i>pispasim</i>,</b> which are dice of marble or other types of stone. <b>But</b> the Sages <b>did not</b> mean to <b>say</b> that <b>only</b> one who plays <b>with <i>pispasim</i></b> is disqualified from bearing witness, but <b>rather even</b> one who plays with <b>nutshells or pomegranate shells</b> is disqualified.

### Part 4
<b>And when is their repentance</b> accepted, so that they may resume being fit to bear witness? <b>Once they break their <i>pispasim</i> and repent of them completely,</b> abandoning this occupation entirely, <b>where they do not do</b> this <b>even for nothing,</b> i.e., they do not play even without betting.

### Part 5
The <i>baraita</i> continues: The expression: <b>One who lends with interest,</b> is referring to <b>both the lender and the borrower.</b> Both are disqualified. <b>And when is their repentance</b> accepted? <b>Once they tear their</b> promissory <b>notes and repent of them completely,</b> abandoning this occupation entirely, where <b>they do not lend</b> with interest <b>even to a gentile.</b>

### Part 6
The expression: <b>And</b> those <b>who fly pigeons,</b> is referring to <b>those who induce the pigeons</b> to behave in this manner, i.e., they train them. <b>And</b> the Sages <b>did not</b> mean to <b>say</b> that <b>only</b> those who fly <b>pigeons</b> are disqualified; <b>rather, even</b> those who do this with <b>a domesticated animal, an undomesticated animal, or</b> any type of <b>bird</b> are disqualified. <b>And when is their repentance</b> accepted? <b>Once they break their fixtures [<i>pigmeihen</i>]</b> upon which they stand the competing animals, <b>and repent completely,</b> abandoning this occupation entirely, <b>where they do not do</b> this <b>even in the wilderness,</b> where there is no one from whom to steal.

### Part 7
The expression: <b>Merchants</b> who trade in the produce <b>of the Sabbatical</b> Year, is referring to <b>those who do business with</b> the <b>produce of the Sabbatical</b> Year. <b>And when is their repentance</b> accepted? <b>Once another Sabbatical</b> Year <b>occurs and they refrain</b> from selling its produce or from assuming ownership of such produce.

### Part 8
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And Rabbi Neḥemya said:</b> The Sages <b>did not say</b> that <b>verbal repentance alone</b> is sufficient for a merchant who traded in the produce of the Sabbatical Year to be reinstated as a valid witness; <b>rather, returning</b> the <b>money</b> is also necessary. <b>How</b> can one return the money he gained from selling produce of the Sabbatical Year? <b>He says: I, so-and-so the son of so-and-so, gathered,</b> i.e., profited, <b>two hundred dinars</b> from trading <b>in</b> the <b>produce of the Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>and</b> as I gained it improperly, this sum is <b>hereby given as a gift to the poor.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara explains the objection: <b>In any event, it is taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that the status of one who flies pigeons applies to one who uses <b>a domesticated animal</b> in the same manner. <b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> that the term: One who flies pigeons, is referring to those who race pigeons, saying: <b>If your pigeon reaches</b> a certain destination <b>before my pigeon</b> I will give you such and such an amount of money, <b>this is how you find</b> a parallel case of one who races <b>a domesticated animal</b> against another animal. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that the term pigeon flyer means <b>an <i>ara</i>, is a domesticated animal capable of</b> luring other domesticated animals?

### Part 10
The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> the <i>baraita</i> states this <b>with regard to the wild ox,</b> which can be lured away from its owner’s property because it is not a completely domesticated animal. <b>And</b> the <i>baraita</i> states this <b>according to the one who says</b> that <b>the wild ox is a species of domesticated animal, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 8:6): <b>The wild ox is a species of domesticated animal.</b> But <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> It is <b>a species of undomesticated animal.</b>

### Part 11
§ It was <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Sages <b>added the robbers and those who force transactions,</b> i.e., who compel others to sell to them, <b>to</b> the list of those who are disqualified from bearing witness.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>A robber is</b> disqualified <b>by Torah law;</b> why is it necessary for the Sages to add such an individual to the list? The Gemara answers: It <b>is necessary only to</b> add one who steals <b>an item found by a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor,</b> who acquire those items by rabbinic law only (see <i>Gittin</i> 59b). Since these people are not considered halakhically competent, by Torah law they do not acquire an item that they find, and consequently one who steals such an item from them is not in violation of a prohibition by Torah law.

### Part 13
One possibility is that taking such an item is prohibited by rabbinic law because it constitutes robbery. Nevertheless, <b>initially</b> the Sages did not disqualify such an individual from bearing witness, as they <b>assumed</b> that the case of <b>an item found by a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor is uncommon.</b> Therefore, it was not deemed necessary to disqualify one who robs them of such an item. <b>Alternatively,</b> the Sages may have reasoned that taking such an item is prohibited <b>merely on account of the ways of peace,</b> i.e., to foster peace and prevent strife and controversy, and is not considered actual robbery. <b>When they realized that ultimately</b> these people <b>were taking property</b> from others and were likely to perform actual robbery, <b>the Sages disqualified them.</b>

### Part 14
Similarly, with regard to <b>those who force transactions, initially</b> the Sages did not disqualify them, as <b>they assumed</b> that their behavior could be excused for two reasons: <b>They would pay money</b> for the items they took, and their forcing transactions <b>was merely occasional;</b> it was not a common practice. <b>When they realized that</b> these people <b>were snatching</b> items regularly, <b>the Sages issued a decree that they</b> are disqualified from bearing witness.

### Part 15
§ It is <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Sages <b>further added</b> the following <b>to</b> the list of those disqualified from bearing witness: <b>The shepherds,</b> who shepherd their animals in the fields of others and are therefore considered like robbers; <b>the collectors</b> of government taxes, who collect more than the amount that people are legally liable to pay; <b>and the customs officials,</b> who collect customs in an illegal manner.

### Part 16
The Gemara explains: <b>Shepherds</b> were not disqualified at first, as the Sages <b>initially assumed it was merely incidental</b> that they would let their animals graze in the fields of others. <b>When they realized that they would intentionally send</b> the animals to the fields of others <b>from the outset, the Sages issued a decree that they</b> are disqualified from bearing witness. <b>The collectors</b> of taxes <b>and the customs officials</b> were not disqualified at first, as the Sages <b>initially assumed they would take the set amount they</b> were instructed to take. <b>When they realized that</b> these officials <b>were taking more</b> than that, <b>they disqualified them.</b>

### Part 17
<b>Rava says:</b> The <b>shepherd that</b> the Sages <b>said</b> is disqualified from bearing witness is referring to <b>both a shepherd of small livestock and a herder of large livestock.</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rava say this? But doesn’t Rava say: Shepherds of small livestock in Eretz Yisrael are disqualified</b> from bearing witness, as besides grazing in others’ fields they also ruin the land? <b>Outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>they are fit</b> to bear witness. By contrast, <b>herders of large livestock, even in Eretz Yisrael, are fit</b> to bear witness. The Gemara answers: <b>That was stated with regard to</b> those <b>who raise</b> their animals on their own land, without herding them on land in the public domain.

### Part 19
The Gemara suggests a proof for Rava’s opinion that a herder of large livestock is also disqualified: <b>This too stands to reason, from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the mishna (24a) <b>teaches</b> that a litigant may state: <b>Three cattle herders are trusted for me</b> in court; by inference, cattle herders are generally disqualified. <b>What, is it not with regard to bearing witness</b> that cattle herders are disqualified, in accordance with Rava’s statement?

### Part 20
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>No,</b> it is <b>with regard to</b> sitting in <b>judgment.</b> The Gemara comments: The language of the mishna <b>is also precise</b> according to this interpretation, <b>as it teaches: Three cattle herders</b> are trusted for me. <b>And if</b> it is <b>with regard to bearing witness, why do I</b> need <b>three</b> witnesses? Two are enough.

### Part 21
The Gemara asks: <b>But rather,</b> with regard to <b>what</b> are cattle herders disqualified? If it is <b>with regard to</b> sitting in <b>judgment, why</b> does the mishna mention <b>specifically three cattle herders? Any three</b> people <b>who did not study <i>halakha</i> are also</b> disqualified from serving as a court.

### Part 22
The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying:</b> The litigants can accept as judges <b>even those</b> cattle herders <b>who</b> dwell in the fields and <b>do not frequent the settled area,</b> and are therefore not proficient in the ways of business.

### Part 23
<b>Rav Yehuda says: An ordinary shepherd</b> is <b>disqualified</b> from bearing witness unless the court recognizes him as one who does not let his animals graze in the fields of others. <b>An ordinary</b> tax <b>collector</b> is <b>fit</b> unless the court determines he is one who collects more than people are obligated to pay.

### Part 24
The Gemara relates a story about a tax collector: <b>The father of Rabbi Zeira collected</b> taxes for <b>thirteen years. When the head</b> tax collector of the <b>river</b> region <b>would come to the city,</b> Rabbi Zeira’s father would prepare the residents ahead of time. <b>When he would see the rabbis, he would say to them</b> as a hint: <b>“Come, my people, enter into your chambers,</b> and shut your doors behind you; hide yourself for a little moment until the indignation has passed” (Isaiah 26:20). He said this so that the head tax collector would not see the rabbis, and it would be possible to lower the taxes of the city. <b>When he would see</b> the ordinary <b>people of the city, he would say</b> to them: Beware, as <b>the head</b> tax collector of the <b>river</b> region <b>is coming to the city, and will now slaughter the father,</b> i.e., take one’s money, <b>before the son, and the son before the father.</b>
