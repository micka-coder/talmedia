### Part 1
§ <b>Rabbi Yannai says:</b> One is <b>not liable</b> for passing his child through fire to Molekh <b>unless he hands him over to</b> the <b>priests</b> of Molekh, <b>as it is stated: “And you shall not give any of your offspring to pass them over to Molekh”</b> (Leviticus 18:21), which indicates that the prohibition is to give, i.e., to hand the child over to the priests.

### Part 2
<b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that one who <b>passed</b> his child through fire <b>but did not hand</b> him <b>over</b> to the priests of Molekh <b>should be liable.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “You shall not give.”</b> If one <b>handed over</b> his son <b>to the</b> priests of <b>Molekh but did not pass</b> him through fire, one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he should be liable.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “To pass,”</b> indicating that passing is also necessary. If one <b>handed over</b> the child <b>and passed</b> him through fire, <b>not to</b> priests of <b>Molekh</b> but rather to priests of another object of idol worship, one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he should be liable.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “To Molekh.”</b>

### Part 3
If one <b>handed over</b> his child <b>and passed</b> him <b>over to the</b> priests of <b>Molekh, but</b> he did <b>not</b> pass him <b>through the fire,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he should be liable. It is stated here,</b> in the verse: <b>“To pass,” and it is stated there,</b> in another verse: <b>“There shall not be found among you one who passes his son or his daughter through the fire”</b> (Deuteronomy 18:10). <b>Just as there,</b> the verse is referring to passing one’s child <b>through the fire, so too here,</b> the reference is to passing one’s child <b>through the fire. And just as here,</b> the verse is referring to one who passes his child over to the priests of <b>Molekh, so too there,</b> the reference is to <b>Molekh</b> alone, excluding any other object of idol worship.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, says:</b> One who <b>passed all his offspring</b> through fire to the priests of Molekh is <b>exempt, as it is stated: “Of your offspring,”</b> indicating: <b>But not all your offspring.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rav Ashi raises a dilemma:</b> If one <b>passed</b> through the fire a child of his who is <b>blind, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Furthermore, if one passed his child through the fire while the child was <b>asleep, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does the child need to be capable of passing through on his own, or is that not necessary? Likewise, if one passed <b>his son’s son or his daughter’s son</b> through the fire, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: <b>Resolve at least one</b> of these dilemmas, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state: “Because he has given of his offspring to Molekh”</b> (Leviticus 20:3)? What is added by this statement? <b>Because it is stated: “There shall not be found among you one who passes his son or his daughter through the fire,” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that it is prohibited for one to pass <b>his son or daughter. From where</b> do I derive that one who passes <b>his son’s son or his daughter’s son</b> is also liable? <b>The verse states: “When he gives of his offspring”</b> (Leviticus 20:4). The term “offspring” indicates that grandchildren are included. This resolves one of Rav Ashi’s dilemmas.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: The <b><i>tanna</i> began</b> his exposition <b>with</b> the phrase in the verse <b>“because</b> he has given <b>of his offspring,” and ended with</b> an interpretation of the phrase in the verse <b>“when he gives of his offspring.”</b> Why did he cite two different verses as proof for his halakhic statement?

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: The second verse <b>is</b> stated in the <i>baraita</i> for <b>a different exposition,</b> which was omitted from the <i>baraita</i> and reads as follows: From the term in the verse <b>“his offspring” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that one is liable for passing through the fire his <b>offspring</b> of <b>unflawed</b> lineage, i.e., his descendants from a woman whom he was permitted to marry. <b>From where</b> do I derive that one is liable for passing through the fire his <b>offspring</b> of <b>flawed</b> lineage, e.g., a <i>mamzer</i>, as well? <b>The verse states: “When he gives of his offspring,”</b> indicating that one is liable for passing any of his offspring.

### Part 9
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> One is <b>not liable</b> for passing his child through fire to Molekh <b>unless he passes him</b> in the typical <b>manner of passing.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is considered</b> the typical manner of passing? <b>Abaye says:</b> The child is taken by foot along <b>a latticework [<i>sirega</i>] of bricks in the middle,</b> between the <b>fire on this side and</b> the <b>fire on that side.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Rava says:</b> The typical manner of passing is <b>like the leaps</b> of children <b>on Purim.</b> It was customary to light a bonfire on Purim inside a pit, and children would amuse themselves by leaping over the bonfires. Passing one’s child over a fire in such a fashion is the typical manner of passing a child over to Molekh.

### Part 11
The Gemara comments: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rava:</b> One is <b>not liable unless he passes</b> his child through the fire in the typical <b>manner of passing. If he passed her by foot,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b> Evidently, the passing ritual is performed by leaping and not by walking.

### Part 12
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> one <b>is liable only for</b> passing <b>his descendants. How so?</b> If one passed <b>his son or his daughter</b> through the fire, he is <b>liable.</b> If he passed <b>his father, or his mother, his brother, or his sister,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b> If one <b>passed himself</b> over to Molekh, he is <b>exempt. And Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, deems</b> him <b>liable.</b>

### Part 13
<b>Both</b> one who passes his child through fire <b>to Molekh and</b> one who passes his child through fire <b>to other</b> objects of <b>idol worship</b> are <b>liable. Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says:</b> If he passes him over <b>to Molekh,</b> he is <b>liable,</b> but if he transfers him to another object of idol worship, <b>not to Molekh,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Ulla says: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon,</b> who deems one who passes himself over to Molekh liable? <b>The verse states: “There shall not be found among you</b> one who passes his son or his daughter through the fire” (Deuteronomy 18:10), and the term <b>“among you”</b> is interpreted homiletically to mean: <b>Among yourself.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>And do the Rabbis not interpret</b> the term <b>“among you”</b> as referring to oneself? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 33a): If one finds <b>his lost item and his father’s lost item,</b> taking care of <b>his</b> own lost item <b>takes precedence. And we said</b> in discussion of that mishna: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>And Rav Yehuda said</b> that it is because <b>the verse states: “Only so that there shall be no needy among you”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:4), meaning that one must avoid becoming needy. Therefore, if one lost an item, tending to <b>his</b> lost item <b>takes precedence over</b> tending to the lost item <b>of any</b> other <b>person.</b> Apparently, this interpretation of the verse is based on the understanding that the term “among you” is referring to oneself, i.e., one must take care of himself so that he will not become needy.

### Part 16
The Gemara answers: <b>And there,</b> in that discussion, the <i>halakha</i> is derived <b>from</b> the word <b>“only,”</b> a limiting term, which is interpreted to mean that in preventing destitution one should begin with himself.

### Part 17
§ <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: Why</b> is the punishment of <b>excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>]</b> mentioned <b>three</b> times <b>with regard to idol worship?</b> It is stated twice with regard to the ritual of Molekh, in the verse: “I will also set My face against that man, and I will excise him from among his people” (Leviticus 20:3), and in the verse: “Then I will set My face against that man, and against his family, and I will excise him” (Leviticus 20:5). The third mention of <i>karet</i> is with regard to one who blasphemes: “That person blasphemes the Lord, and that soul shall be excised from among his people” (Numbers 15:30).

### Part 18
<b>One</b> mention <b>is for</b> worshipping an idol <b>in its</b> typical <b>manner</b> of worship, <b>and one</b> mention <b>is for</b> worshipping an idol <b>not in its</b> typical <b>manner</b> of worship, <b>and one</b> mention <b>is for</b> performing the ritual of <b>Molekh.</b>

### Part 19
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who says</b> that <b>Molekh is</b> an object of <b>idol worship, why do I</b> need a special mention of <b><i>karet</i> with regard to Molekh?</b> The Gemara answers: It is necessary <b>for</b> the case of <b>one who passes his child</b> through fire to an idol other than Molekh, where this is <b>not its</b> typical <b>manner</b> of worship. According to this opinion, one who passes his son through fire to any idol is liable.

### Part 20
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who says</b> that the verse concerning <b>one who blasphemes is</b> referring to one who engages in <b>idol worship</b> and not to one who curses God, <b>why do I</b> need <b><i>karet</i></b> to be mentioned <b>with regard to one who blasphemes?</b>

### Part 21
The Gemara answers that it is necessary <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is stated with regard to one who blasphemes: “Because he has despised the word of the Lord, and has breached His mitzva, that soul <b>shall be excised [<i>hikkaret tikkaret</i>],</b> his iniquity shall be upon him” (Numbers 15:31). The phrase “<i>hikkaret tikkaret</i>” is interpreted as follows: <b>“<i>Hikkaret</i>”;</b> the sinner is excised <b>in this world,</b> meaning that he will die prematurely. <b>“<i>Tikkaret</i>”;</b> the sinner is excised <b>in the World-to-Come,</b> and he will not merit everlasting life. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva.</b>

### Part 22
<b>Rabbi Yishmael said to him: But isn’t it already stated</b> in the previous verse: “He blasphemes the Lord; that soul <b>shall be excised [<i>venikhreta</i>]”</b> (Numbers 15:30)? <b>Are there three worlds</b> in which the sinner is excised? <b>Rather,</b> from the term in the verse <b>“<i>venikhreta</i>”</b> it is derived that the sinner is excised <b>in this world,</b> from the term <b>“<i>hikkaret</i>”</b> it is derived that the sinner is excised <b>in the World-to-Come,</b> and nothing is derived from the doubled verb “<i>hikkaret <b>tikkaret</b></i><b>,”</b> as <b>the Torah spoke in the language of people.</b>
