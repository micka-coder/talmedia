### Part 1
The mishna explains: <b>A prohibition</b> resulting from <b>a mitzva</b> is referring to <b>secondary</b> forbidden <b>relatives,</b> e.g., one’s son’s daughter-in-law, who are forbidden <b>by rabbinic law.</b> The Sages instituted this prohibition in order to distance people from incest. The Gemara explains: <b>And why do</b> the Sages <b>call it a prohibition</b> resulting from <b>a mitzva? Because it is a mitzva to listen to the words of the Sages.</b>

### Part 2
The mishna continues: <b>A prohibition</b> stemming from <b>sanctity</b> is referring to the marriage of <b>a widow to a High Priest,</b> or to the marriage of <b>a divorcée or</b> of <b>a woman who has performed <i>ḥalitza</i> [<i>ḥalutza</i>], to an ordinary priest.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>And why do</b> the Sages <b>call it a prohibition</b> stemming from <b>sanctity? As it is written</b> with regard to the priests: <b>“They shall be sanctified to their God”</b> (Leviticus 21:6).

### Part 3
<b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to</b> this mishna: <b>Rabbi Yehuda switches</b> the terms; he refers to the marriage of a divorcée or of a <i>ḥalutza</i> to a priest as a prohibition resulting from a mitzva, and to the marriage of secondary relatives as a prohibition stemming from sanctity.

### Part 4
The Gemara infers: <b>He switches</b> the terms but does not dispute the <i>halakha</i>; <b>but</b> even Rabbi Yehuda agrees that if a priest marries a <i>ḥalutza</i> and then dies, <b>she requires <i>ḥalitza</i>. And if it enters your mind</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> this poses a difficulty; <b>after all,</b> those <b>liable for</b> violating <b>prohibitions, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, are considered like those liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i>, and those liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i> are not capable of</b> performing <b><i>ḥalitza</i> and levirate marriage,</b> as the mitzva of levirate marriage does not apply to such relationships.

### Part 5
The Gemara resolves the difficulty: Rabbi Yehuda does hold in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva, and as for his comment with regard to the definitions of a prohibition resulting from a mitzva and a prohibition stemming from sanctity, he merely <b>stated</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with the statement of the first <i>tanna</i>; but he himself does not hold accordingly.</b>

### Part 6
§ <b>When Rav Yitzḥak came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>as we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> One who engages in intercourse with his mother who is also his father’s wife <b>is liable</b> to bring <b>only</b> one sin-offering, <b>due to the</b> fact that she is his <b>mother,</b> whether or not her marriage to his father was legitimate.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> for this? <b>Abaye says:</b> It is <b>because the verse states:</b> “The nakedness of your father and the nakedness of your mother you shall not uncover: <b>She is your mother;</b> you shall not uncover her nakedness” (Leviticus 18:7). Rabbi Yehuda derives from this verse that <b>you shall render him liable due to</b> the fact that she is <b>his mother, but you shall not render him liable</b> to bring another sin-offering <b>due to</b> the fact that she is his <b>father’s wife.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> it should be derived from the verse: <b>“The nakedness of your father’s wife you shall not uncover; it is your father’s nakedness”</b> (Leviticus 18:8), that <b>you shall render him liable due to</b> the fact that she is his <b>father’s wife, but you shall not render him liable due to</b> the fact that she is <b>his mother.</b>

### Part 9
<b>But</b> if so, with regard to one’s <b>mother who is his father’s wife,</b> it is found that the verse <b>stands,</b> i.e., is written, <b>here,</b> with regard to intercourse with one’s mother, <b>and excludes</b> liability due to the fact that she is his father’s wife, and <b>stands there,</b> with regard to intercourse with one’s father’s wife, <b>and excludes</b> liability due to the fact that she is his mother. The result <b>now</b> is that for <b>his mother who is not his father’s wife he is rendered liable,</b> and for <b>his father’s wife who is not his mother he is rendered liable,</b> but for <b>his mother who is his father’s wife he is not rendered liable at all,</b> which seems absurd.

### Part 10
<b>And furthermore, according to the Rabbis too,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Yehuda and hold that one who engages in intercourse with his mother who is married to his father is liable to bring two sin-offerings, <b>isn’t</b> the verse: <b>“She is your mother,” written;</b> i.e., how do they explain this verse? <b>Rather, that</b> phrase is <b>necessary for</b> the <i>halakha</i> derived from it by <b>Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi,</b> as the Gemara will soon explain (54a). Therefore, <b>according to Rabbi Yehuda as well, that</b> phrase is <b>necessary for</b> the <i>halakha</i> derived by <b>Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi,</b> and Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion in the mishna cannot be derived from it.

### Part 11
<b>Rather, Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, says</b> that there is a different source for Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion: <b>The verse states:</b> “You shall not uncover <b>her nakedness [<i>ervatah</i>],”</b> in the singular form, from which it is derived that <b>you shall render him liable for one forbidden sexual relationship [<i>erva</i>], but you shall not render him liable for two</b> types of <b>forbidden sexual relationships.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> then from the verse: <b>“You shall not uncover the nakedness of your daughter-in-law; she is your son’s wife, you shall not uncover her nakedness”</b> (Leviticus 18:15), should it <b>also</b> be derived that <b>you shall render him liable for one forbidden sexual relationship, but you shall not render him liable for two</b> types of <b>forbidden sexual relationships?</b>

### Part 13
<b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>One who engages in intercourse with his daughter-in-law</b> is <b>liable</b> to bring two sin-offerings <b>for</b> his intercourse with <b>her:</b> One <b>due to</b> the prohibition against engaging in intercourse with one’s <b>daughter-in-law, and</b> one <b>due to</b> the prohibition against engaging in intercourse with <b>a married woman;</b> the former liability applies <b>both during his son’s lifetime and after his son’s death. And Rabbi Yehuda does not dispute</b> this <i>halakha</i>.

### Part 14
<b>Rather,</b> it must be explained that <b>since</b> the daughter-in-law has <b>one body, although</b> engaging in intercourse with her involves <b>two prohibitions,</b> the term <b>“her nakedness [<i>ervatah</i>],”</b> in the singular, <b>is written. Here too,</b> with regard to one’s father’s wife, <b>since</b> she has <b>one body, although</b> there <b>are two prohibitions,</b> the term <b>“her nakedness [<i>ervatah</i>]” is written.</b>

### Part 15
<b>Rather, Rava says</b> that there is an alternative source for Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion: <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that concerning the meaning of the phrase <b>“the nakedness of your father,” this is</b> referring to <b>your father’s wife. And he derives</b> this interpretation <b>by means of a verbal analogy</b> from the verse: “And the man who lies with his father’s wife, he has uncovered his father’s nakedness” (Leviticus 20:11).

### Part 16
<b>And</b> the Torah <b>indicates</b> that she is forbidden <b>whether</b> she is <b>his father’s wife who is his mother</b> or <b>whether</b> she is <b>his father’s wife who is not his mother. From where</b> is it derived that one who engages in intercourse with <b>his mother who is not his father’s wife</b> is liable? <b>The verse states</b> subsequently: <b>“The nakedness of your mother you shall not uncover.”</b> And from the ensuing phrase: <b>“She is your mother,”</b> it is derived that in a case where his mother is also his father’s wife, <b>you shall render him liable due to</b> the fact that she is <b>his mother, but you shall not render him liable due to</b> the fact that she is <b>his father’s wife.</b>
