<b>replenishes</b> itself, as if it is cut another grows, <b>and its roots are numerous. And even if all the winds that are in the world come and gust against it, they do not move it from its place</b> and uproot it. <b>Rather, it goes and comes with</b> the winds. And <b>once the winds subside the reed remains in its place.</b>

### Part 2
<b>But Balaam the wicked blessed them with a cedar.</b> There is an aspect of curse in that blessing, as he was saying they will be <b>just like a cedar</b> that <b>does not stand in a place</b> near <b>water, and its roots are few</b> relative to its height, <b>and its trunk does not replenish</b> itself, as if it is cut it does not grow back. And <b>even</b> if <b>all the winds that are in the world come and gust against it, they do not move it from its place</b> and uproot it; but <b>once a southern wind gusts it immediately uproots</b> the cedar <b>and overturns it on its face. Moreover,</b> it is <b>the reed that was privileged to</b> have <b>a quill [<i>kulmos</i>] taken from it to write scrolls of Torah, Prophets, and Writings.</b> Therefore, the curse of Ahijah is better than the blessing of Balaam.

### Part 3
§ It is stated with regard to Balaam: <b>“And he looked at the Kenite and he took up his parable</b> and said: Though firm is your dwelling place, and though your nest be set in rock” (Numbers 24:21). <b>Balaam said to Yitro: Kenite,</b> were <b>you not in Egypt with us in that counsel</b> to drown the newborn males of Israel? <b>Who placed you alongside the mighty of the world?</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara comments: <b>And that is what Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Simai says: Three were</b> associates <b>in that counsel, and they are: Balaam, Job, and Yitro. Balaam, who advised</b> to drown the newborn males, <b>was killed. Job, who was silent</b> and was reluctant to express his opinion, <b>was sentenced to</b> suffer <b>afflictions. And Yitro, who fled</b> after he disagreed with that counsel and Pharaoh sought to kill him, <b>his descendants were privileged to sit</b> as scribes in session with the Sanhedrin <b>in the Chamber of Hewn Stone, as it is stated: “And the families of the scribes who dwelt in Jabez; the Tirathites, the Shimeathites, the Sucathites. These were the Kenites who came of Hammath the father of the house of Rechab”</b> (I Chronicles 2:55). <b>And it is written there</b> with regard to the identity of the Kenites: <b>“And the children of the Kenite, Moses’ father-in-law, went up from the city of the palm trees”</b> (Judges 1:16).

### Part 5
With regard to the verse: <b>“And he took up his parable, and said: Alas, he who lives from what God has appointed him”</b> (Numbers 24:23), <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: Woe unto one who sustains himself</b> in an indulgent manner <b>in the name of God,</b> i.e., Balaam, whose livelihood was from speaking in the name of God. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Woe unto the nation that will be found</b> hindering the Jewish people <b>at the time when the Holy One, Blessed be He, redeems His children. Who places his garment between a male lion and a female lion when they are mating?</b> One who does so will certainly die.

### Part 6
With regard to the verse: <b>“And ships come from the coast of Kittim”</b> (Numbers 24:24), <b>Rav says:</b> This is <b>the Roman legion [<i>libbun aspir</i>]</b> that will attack Assyria. <b>“And they shall afflict Assyria, and they shall afflict Eber”</b> (Numbers 24:24). <b>Before</b> they reach <b>Assyria they will kill</b> the Jewish people; <b>from that</b> point <b>forward they will enslave them</b> and not kill them.

### Part 7
§ Balaam said to Balak: <b>“Behold, I go to my people; come therefore, and I shall advise you what this people shall do to your people”</b> (Numbers 24:14). Ostensibly, <b>he should have</b> said: What <b>your people</b> shall do <b>to this people. Rabbi Abba bar Kahana says:</b> Balaam spoke <b>like a person who curses himself</b> but does not wish to utter so awful a matter <b>and</b> instead <b>ascribes his curse to</b> take effect on <b>others.</b>

### Part 8
Balaam <b>said to them: The God of these</b> Jewish people <b>despises lewdness, and they desire linen garments,</b> as they have no new garments; <b>come, and I will give you advice. Make for them</b> enclosures using wall <b>hangings and seat prostitutes in them,</b> with <b>an old woman outside</b> the enclosure <b>and a young woman inside, and</b> have the women <b>sell them linen garments.</b>

### Part 9
Balak <b>made for them</b> enclosures using wall <b>hangings from the snow mountain,</b> the Ḥermon, <b>until Beit HaYeshimot, and he sat prostitutes in them,</b> with <b>an old woman outside and a young woman on the inside. And at the time when Jewish people were eating and drinking and were glad and going out to stroll in the marketplace, the old woman would say to</b> a Jew: <b>Aren’t you seeking linen garments?</b> He would enter the enclosure and ask the price, <b>the old woman would quote him</b> a price <b>equal</b> to its value, <b>and the young woman would quote him</b> a price <b>less</b> than its value. That scenario would repeat itself <b>two or three times.</b>

### Part 10
<b>And thereafter she would say to him: You are like a member of our household, sit</b> and <b>choose for yourself</b> the merchandise that you want. <b>And a jug of Ammonite wine was placed near her, and</b> neither <b>Ammonite wine nor gentile wine had been prohibited yet</b> for Jews. <b>She said to him: Is it your wish to drink a cup of wine? Once he drank</b> the wine, his evil inclination <b>burned within him.</b>

### Part 11
<b>He</b> then <b>said to her: Submit to me</b> and engage in intercourse with me. <b>She</b> then <b>removed</b> the <b>idol</b> that <b>she worshipped from her lap and said to him: Worship this. He said to her: Am I not Jewish?</b> I am therefore forbidden from engaging in idol worship. <b>She said to him: And what is your concern? We are asking you to do nothing more than defecate</b> in its presence. <b>But he does not know that its worship</b> is conducted <b>in that</b> manner. Once he did so, she said to him: <b>Moreover, I will not leave you until you deny the Torah of Moses your teacher, as it is stated: “But when they came to Ba’al-Peor they separated themselves to the shameful item; and they became detestable like that which they loved”</b> (Hosea 9:10). They devoted themselves to the disgrace of defecation, and detested the name of God.

### Part 12
With regard to the verse: <b>“And Israel dwelt in Shittim”</b> (Numbers 25:1), <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Shittim</b> is <b>the name of</b> the place. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> It is an allusion to the fact <b>that they were engaged in matters of nonsense [<i>shetut</i>],</b> i.e., prostitution and idol worship.

### Part 13
With regard to the verse: <b>“And they called [<i>vatikrena</i>] the people to the offerings of their gods”</b> (Numbers 25:2), <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Naked women encountered them. Rabbi Yehoshua says: They all became those who experienced a seminal emission [<i>kerayin</i>]</b> resulting from the lust that they experienced.

### Part 14
Apropos the homiletic interpretation of the names of places, the Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the connotation of the <b>term Rephidim</b> (see Exodus 19:2)? <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Rephidim</b> is <b>the name of</b> the place. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> It is an allusion to the fact <b>that they enfeebled [<i>rippu</i>] themselves with regard to</b> engaging in <b>matters of Torah, as it is stated: “The fathers do not look back to their children from feebleness [<i>rifyon</i>] of hands”</b> (Jeremiah 47:3). There too, the connotation of the name is dereliction in the study of Torah.

### Part 15
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Everywhere that it is stated: And he dwelt, it is nothing other than an expression of pain,</b> of an impending calamity, <b>as it is stated: “And Israel dwelt in Shittim, and the people began to commit harlotry with the daughters of Moab”</b> (Numbers 25:1). It is stated: <b>“And Jacob dwelt in the land where his father had sojourned in the land of Canaan”</b> (Genesis 37:1), and it is stated thereafter: <b>“And Joseph brought evil report of them to his father”</b> (Genesis 37:2), which led to the sale of Joseph. <b>And it is stated: “And Israel dwelt</b> in the land of Egypt <b>in the land of Goshen”</b> (Genesis 47:27), and it is stated thereafter: <b>“And the time drew near that Israel was to die”</b> (Genesis 47:29). It is stated: <b>“And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree”</b> (I Kings 5:5), and it is stated thereafter: <b>“And the Lord raised up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite; he was of the king’s seed in Edom”</b> (I Kings 11:14).

### Part 16
§ With regard to Balaam, it is stated: <b>“And they slew the kings of Midian, with the rest of their slain…And Balaam, son of Beor, they slew with the sword”</b> (Numbers 31:8). The Gemara asks: <b>Balaam, what did he seek there;</b> what was his role in that war? He lived in Aram. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: He went to collect payment for twenty-four thousand</b> members <b>of the Jewish people, whom he felled</b> with his advice. <b>Mar Zutra bar Toviya says</b> that <b>Rav says</b> that <b>this</b> is in accordance with the adage <b>that people say: A camel goes to seek horns</b> and <b>the ears that it had are severed from it.</b> Not only was Balaam unsuccessful in collecting his fee, he also lost his life.

### Part 17
It is stated: <b>“And Balaam, son of Beor, the diviner,</b> did the children of Israel slay with the sword among the rest of their slain” (Joshua 13:22). The Gemara asks: Was he <b>a diviner? He is a prophet. Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Initially</b> he was <b>a prophet, but ultimately,</b> he lost his capacity for prophecy and remained merely <b>a diviner. Rav Pappa says</b> that <b>this</b> is in accordance with the adage <b>that people say:</b> This woman <b>was</b> descended <b>from princes and rulers,</b> and <b>was licentious with carpenters.</b>
