### Part 1
That is the course that history was to take, <b>but due to our sins that</b> time frame <b>increased.</b> The Messiah did not come after four thousand years passed, and furthermore, the years <b>that elapsed since</b> then, which were to have been the messianic era, <b>have elapsed.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Elijah</b> the prophet <b>said to Rav Yehuda, brother of Rav Sala Ḥasida: The world will</b> exist <b>no fewer than eighty-five Jubilee</b> cycles, or 4,250 years. <b>And during the final Jubilee, the son of David</b> will <b>come.</b> Rav Yehuda <b>said to</b> Elijah: Will the Messiah come <b>during the beginning of</b> the Jubilee <b>or during its end?</b> Elijah <b>said to</b> Rav Yehuda: <b>I do not know.</b> Rav Yehuda asked: Will this last Jubilee cycle <b>end</b> before the Messiah comes <b>or</b> will it <b>not</b> yet <b>end</b> before his coming? Elijah <b>said to him: I do not know. Rav Ashi says: This</b> is what <b>Elijah said to him: Until that time do not anticipate his</b> coming; <b>from this</b> point <b>forward anticipate his</b> coming. Elijah did not inform Rav Yehuda of the date of the coming of the Messiah.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Ḥanan bar Taḥlifa sent</b> a message <b>to Rav Yosef: I found one man, and in his hand</b> there was <b>one scroll written</b> in <b><i>Ashurit</i></b> script <b>and</b> in <b>the sacred tongue,</b> Hebrew. <b>I said to him: From where</b> did <b>this</b> scroll come <b>into your</b> possession? <b>He said to me: I was hired to</b> serve in <b>the Roman army and I found</b> the scroll <b>among the Roman archives.</b> It was clear that the scroll was written by Jews, not Romans. <b>And it is written in</b> the scroll: <b>After 4,291 years</b> have elapsed <b>from the creation of the world, the world will end; during</b> those years there will be <b>the wars of the sea monsters</b> between the leviathan and the animals, and <b>among</b> those years there will be <b>the wars of Gog and Magog and the remaining</b> years of the <b>messianic period.</b> Then the world will be destroyed. <b>And the Holy One, Blessed be He, will renew His world only after</b> the passage of <b>seven thousand years. Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, says</b> that <b>it was stated: After</b> the passage of <b>five thousand years.</b>

### Part 4
§ <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Natan says: This verse penetrates and descends until the depths;</b> just as the depths are unfathomable, so too, the period depicted in the following verse is unquantifiable. <b>“For the vision is yet for the appointed time; and it declares of the end, and does not lie; though it tarry, wait for it, because it will surely come; it will not delay”</b> (Habakkuk 2:3).

### Part 5
The Messiah will come <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>our Rabbis, who would interpret</b> the verse: <b>“For a period and periods and a half period”</b> (Daniel 7:25), to mean that the duration of the ultimate exile will be three and a half times the duration of the period of the exile in Egypt.

### Part 6
<b>And</b> the Messiah will come <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Simlai, who would interpret</b> the verse: <b>“You have fed them with the bread of tears and have given them tears to drink in great measure [<i>shalish</i>]”</b> (Psalms 80:6), to mean that the duration of the ultimate exile will be three times the duration of the period of the exile in Egypt.

### Part 7
<b>And</b> the Messiah will come <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who would interpret</b> the verse: <b>“Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens and the earth”</b> (Haggai 2:6), to mean that the redemption would transpire soon after the destruction of the Temple.

### Part 8
<b>Rather, the first,</b> great, Hasmonean <b>monarchy</b> ruled <b>seventy years. The second kingdom,</b> of Herod and his descendants, ruled <b>fifty-two</b> years, <b>and</b> the duration of <b>the monarchy of bar Koziva,</b> or bar Kokheva, was <b>two and a half years.</b> The duration of the exile that follows is unknown.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase <b>“And it declares [<i>veyafe’aḥ</i>] of the end, and does not lie”? Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: May those who calculate the end of days be cursed [<i>tippaḥ</i>], as they would say once the end</b> of days that they calculated <b>arrived and</b> the Messiah <b>did not come,</b> that <b>he will no longer come</b> at all. <b>Rather,</b> the proper behavior is to continue to <b>wait for his</b> coming, <b>as it is stated: “Though it tarry, wait for it.” Lest you say we are</b> expectantly <b>awaiting</b> the end of days <b>and</b> the Holy One, Blessed be He, <b>is not awaiting</b> the end of days and does not want to redeem His people, <b>the verse states: “And therefore will the Lord wait, to be gracious to you; and therefore will He be exalted, to have mercy upon you;</b> for the Lord is a God of judgment; happy are all they who wait for Him” (Isaiah 30:18).

### Part 10
And seemingly, <b>since we are awaiting</b> the end of days <b>and</b> the Holy One, Blessed be He, <b>is</b> also <b>awaiting</b> the end of days, <b>who is preventing</b> the coming of the Messiah? It is <b>the</b> divine <b>attribute of judgment</b> that <b>prevents</b> his coming, as it is written: “For the Lord is a God of judgment,” and we are not worthy. <b>And since the attribute of judgment prevents</b> the coming of the Messiah and we are not worthy of redemption, <b>why do we await</b> his coming daily? We do so in order <b>to receive a reward</b> for awaiting his coming, <b>as it is stated: “Happy are all they who wait for Him.”</b>

### Part 11
Apropos that verse, <b>Abaye said: The world</b> has <b>no fewer than thirty-six righteous</b> people <b>in each generation who greet the Divine Presence, as it is stated: “Happy are all they who wait for Him [<i>lo</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 30:18). <b>The numerical value of <i>lo</i>,</b> spelled <i>lamed vav</i>, <b>is thirty-six.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But doesn’t Rava say: The row</b> of the righteous <b>before the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> extends <b>eighteen thousand parasangs, as it is stated</b> with regard to the city of God at the end of days: <b>“It shall be eighteen thousand reeds round about,</b> and the name of the city from that day shall be: The Lord is there” (Ezekiel 48:35)? The Gemara answers: It is <b>not difficult; this</b> statement of Abaye refers to the thirty-six righteous people <b>who view</b> the Divine Presence <b>through a luminous crystal [<i>be’ispaklarya</i>],</b> and <b>that</b> statement of Rava refers to the multitudes <b>who view</b> the Divine Presence <b>through a crystal that is not luminous.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>And are</b> those who view the Divine Presence through a crystal that is luminous <b>so numerous? But doesn’t Ḥizkiyya say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yirmeya says in the name of Rabbi Shimon bar Yoḥai: I have seen members</b> of the group <b>of</b> the spiritually <b>prominent,</b> who are truly righteous, <b>and they are few. If they</b> number <b>one thousand, I and my son are among them. If they</b> number <b>one hundred, I and my son are among them;</b> and <b>if they</b> number <b>two, I and my son are they.</b> Apparently, it is conceivable that there are no more than two who view the Divine Presence through a luminous crystal.

### Part 13
The Gemara answers: It is <b>not difficult. This</b> statement of Abaye is referring to those <b>who</b> may <b>enter</b> to view the Divine Presence only <b>by</b> requesting and being granted <b>permission [<i>bar</i>]</b> from the angels. <b>That</b> statement of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai is referring to the select few <b>who</b> may <b>enter</b> to view the Divine Presence even <b>without</b> requesting <b>permission,</b> for whom the gates of Heaven are open at all times.

### Part 14
§ <b>Rav says: All the ends</b> of days that were calculated <b>passed, and the matter depends only upon repentance and good deeds.</b> When the Jewish people repent, they will be redeemed. <b>And Shmuel says: It is sufficient for the mourner to endure in his mourning</b> to bring about the coming of the Messiah. Even without repentance, they will be worthy of redemption due to the suffering they endured during the exile. The Gemara notes: This dispute is <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>: Rabbi Eliezer says: If the Jewish people repent they are redeemed, and if not they are not redeemed. Rabbi Yehoshua said to him: If they do not repent, will they not be redeemed</b> at all? <b>Rather, the Holy One, Blessed be He, will establish a king for them whose decrees are as harsh as</b> those issued by <b>Haman, and the Jewish people</b> will have no choice but to <b>repent, and</b> this will <b>restore them to</b> the <b>right</b> path.

### Part 15
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: If the Jewish people repent they are redeemed, as it is stated: “Return, wayward children, I will heal your iniquities”</b> (Jeremiah 3:22). <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to him: But isn’t it already stated:</b> “So says the Lord: <b>You were sold for naught, and without money you shall be redeemed”</b> (Isaiah 52:3)? Rabbi Yehoshua explains: <b>“You were sold for naught”</b> means you were sold <b>for idol worship,</b> which is a sin with no basis. <b>“And without money you shall be redeemed”</b> means you will be redeemed <b>not through repentance and good deeds,</b> but through the will of God.

### Part 16
<b>Rabbi Eliezer said to Rabbi Yehoshua: But isn’t it already stated: “Return to me and I will return to you”</b> (Malachi 3:7)? <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to him: But isn’t it already stated: “For I have taken you to Myself; and I will take you one from a city and two from a family, and I will bring you to Zion”</b> (Jeremiah 3:14), unconditionally?

### Part 17
<b>Rabbi Eliezer said to him: But isn’t it already stated: “In ease [<i>beshuva</i>] and rest shall you be saved”</b> (Isaiah 30:15), indicating that redemption is dependent upon repentance [<i>teshuva</i>]? <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to Rabbi Eliezer: But isn’t it already stated: “So says the Lord, Redeemer of Israel, his Holy One, to him who is despised of man, to him who is abhorred of the nation, to a servant of rulers:</b>
