was <b>difficult.</b> Elijah <b>was accustomed to coming</b> and revealing himself <b>before</b> Rabbi Yosei each day. <b>He was obscured from him for three days and did not come. When he came</b> again, Rabbi Yosei <b>said to him: Why did the Master not come?</b> Elijah <b>said to him:</b> You denigrated me when <b>you called me difficult.</b> Rabbi Yosei <b>said to</b> Elijah: <b>This</b> example <b>that is before us</b> illustrates the point, <b>as my Master was</b> being <b>difficult</b> by not coming during those days.

### Part 2
§ The mishna teaches with regard to the verse: <b>“And there shall cleave nothing of that which was devoted to your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:18), <b>as long as the wicked</b> exist <b>in the world,</b> there is <b>wrath in the world.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Who are</b> these <b>wicked</b> people mentioned in the mishna? <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> They are <b>thieves.</b>

### Part 3
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When <b>a wicked</b> person <b>comes into the world, wrath comes into the world, as it is stated: “When the wicked comes into the world, contempt also comes, and with ignominy, reproach”</b> (Proverbs 18:3). When <b>a wicked</b> person <b>is eliminated from the world, good comes into the world, as it is stated: “And when the wicked perish there is jubilation”</b> (Proverbs 11:10). When <b>a righteous</b> person <b>passes from the world, evil comes into the world, as it is stated: “The righteous perishes and no man lays it to heart; and merciful men are taken, none understand that due to the evil the righteous is taken”</b> (Isaiah 57:1) When <b>a righteous</b> person <b>comes into the world, good comes into the world</b> with him, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to Noah: <b>“This is one who shall comfort us for our work and the toil of our hands”</b> (Genesis 5:29).
