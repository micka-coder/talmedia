### Part 1
<b>and everyone,</b> both the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Natan, holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis who disagree with Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa,</b> and derive from this verse that it is necessary that the witnesses see the incident together, i.e., they were both present and observed the incident at the same time. <b>And here,</b> with regard to whether or not the witnesses must testify in court together, <b>they disagree with regard to</b> whether or not the <b>statement</b> of the witnesses, i.e., their testimony in court, <b>is compared to</b> their <b>observation</b> of the incident. One <b>Sage,</b> the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>holds</b> that <b>we compare</b> their <b>statement to</b> their <b>observation.</b> Therefore, just as they must see the incident together, so too, they must testify together in court. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Natan, <b>holds</b> that <b>we do not compare</b> their statement to their observation.

### Part 2
The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elyakim was striving to ordain Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, and was not successful</b> in his attempts. <b>One day,</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Elyakim <b>was sitting before Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> among Rabbi Yoḥanan’s other students.

### Part 3
Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to</b> his students: <b>Is there</b> anyone <b>who knows</b> whether the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa, or not? Rabbi Shimon ben Elyakim said to him: This</b> one, Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, <b>knows.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: If so, let him say.</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Elyakim <b>said to him: Let the Master ordain him first;</b> since we are all in need of his wisdom, he is fit for ordination. Rabbi Yoḥanan then <b>ordained</b> Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina.

### Part 4
Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: My son, tell me what you heard.</b> Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, <b>said to him: This is what I heard: That Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa concedes to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Natan</b> that it is unnecessary for the witnesses to testify together.

### Part 5
Rabbi Yoḥanan was disappointed, and <b>said: For this I needed</b> to ordain him? <b>Now</b> that with regard to the <b>main</b> element of testimony, i.e., <b>observing</b> the incident, <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa says we do not need</b> both witnesses to see it <b>together,</b> with regard to their <b>statement</b> in court, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to explicate that there is no requirement that they testify together?

### Part 6
Although the statement of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, was unnecessary, Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: Since you ascended,</b> i.e., you were ordained, <b>you will not descend,</b> even though it was in error. <b>Rabbi Zeira said: Conclude from it</b> that with regard to <b>a great man, once he is ordained,</b> even if it was due to mistaken judgment, <b>he is ordained.</b> The ordination is not canceled.

### Part 7
As for the <i>halakha</i> in this matter, <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa</b> that it is unnecessary for the two witnesses to observe the incident together, <b>both with regard to</b> cases of <b>land</b> and <b>with regard to</b> cases of <b>movable property.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Ulla says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa with regard to land,</b> which is unmovable, and therefore both testimonies are certainly about the same piece of land; <b>but not with regard to movable property,</b> as there is a concern that they are not testifying about the same item.

### Part 9
<b>Abaye said to</b> Ulla: If you say that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa with regard to land, <b>by inference</b> you hold <b>that they disagree</b> with regard to this matter. <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Abba say</b> that <b>Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says: The Rabbis concede to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa with regard to testimony</b> concerning <b>land?</b>

### Part 10
<b>And Rav Idi bar Avin teaches in</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>damages</b> that were taught <b>at the school of</b> the Sage <b>Karna: The Rabbis concede to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa</b> that the witnesses do not need to see the incident together <b>with regard to testimony</b> concerning a blemish in a male <b>firstborn</b> kosher animal, which renders it permitted to derive benefit from it, <b>and with regard to testimony</b> concerning ownership of <b>land, and with regard to testimony</b> concerning <b>presumptive ownership</b> of land. Since it is clear that they are testifying about the same land, it is unnecessary for them to see it together. <b>And so</b> they concede with regard to testimony over the two pubic hairs <b>of a boy or of a girl,</b> which are a sign of adulthood.

### Part 11
The Gemara rejects Abaye’s question: <b>Are you setting</b> the statement of one <b>man against</b> the statement of another <b>man?</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Ulla, <b>holds</b> that the Rabbis <b>disagree</b> with Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa even with regard to land, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> i.e., Rav and Rav Idi, <b>holds</b> that <b>they do not disagree.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara asks tangentially about the statement: <b>And so</b> they concede with regard to testimony over the two pubic hairs <b>of a boy or of a girl: What</b> is this referring to? <b>If we say</b> it is referring to testimony that a girl has reached majority, in which <b>one</b> witness <b>says</b> that he saw <b>one</b> hair <b>on</b> the <b>her</b> lower <b>back and one</b> witness <b>says</b> that he saw <b>one</b> hair <b>on her</b> lower <b>abdomen,</b> that is difficult. A girl is considered to have reached maturity when she has two pubic hairs. In this case, two witnesses separately testify that they have each seen one hair. In <b>this</b> case each testimony is obviously invalid, as it <b>is half a matter and</b> also <b>half a testimony.</b> Not only does each testimony refer to one hair, which is half a matter, it is submitted by one witness, which is half a testimony. Consequently, it is obvious that the girl is not considered to have reached majority in this case.

### Part 13
<b>Rather,</b> it must be referring to a case where <b>one says</b> that he saw <b>two</b> hairs <b>on her</b> lower <b>back, and</b> the other <b>one says</b> he saw <b>two</b> hairs <b>on her</b> lower <b>abdomen.</b> Since they each testify that she has reached adulthood, it is unnecessary for them to see the same hairs.

### Part 14
<b>Rav Yosef said: I say in the name of Ulla</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa both with regard to land and with regard to movable property. But the Sages who came from Meḥoza say</b> that <b>Rabbi Zeira says in the name of Rav: With regard to land</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa, <b>but not with regard to movable property.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara comments: <b>Rav</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as Rav says:</b> Testimonies of <b>an admission following an admission</b> are combined into one; if one witness testifies that the respondent admitted in his presence that he owes the claimant, and the other witness testifies that the respondent admitted in his presence that he owes the claimant in a separate incident, their testimonies are combined. Likewise, testimonies of <b>an admission following a loan are combined</b> into one; where one witness testifies that the respondent admitted in his presence that he owes the claimant, and the other one testifies that on a previous date the respondent borrowed money from the claimant in his presence, their testimonies are combined.

### Part 16
Rav continues: But testimonies of <b>a loan following a loan</b> are not combined. If one testifies that the claimant lent the respondent one hundred dinars in his presence, and the other testifies that he lent him one hundred dinars in a separate incident in his presence, their testimonies are not combined, as they are clearly testifying about two separate loans. Similarly, testimonies of <b>a loan following an admission are not combined.</b> If one testifies that the claimant lent money to the respondent, and the other one testifies that on an earlier date the respondent admitted to owing the claimant, their testimonies are not combined.

### Part 17
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak encountered Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua. He said to him: What is different</b> about <b>a loan following a loan,</b> in <b>which</b> case the testimonies are <b>not</b> combined, <b>as the one hundred dinars that this</b> witness <b>saw, that</b> witness <b>did not see?</b> In the case of <b>an admission following an admission as well,</b> perhaps <b>the one hundred dinars about which</b> the respondent <b>admitted in the presence of this</b> witness, <b>he did not admit in the presence of that</b> witness. Perhaps his admissions were in reference to two separate loans, and therefore the testimonies should not be combined.

### Part 18
Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, answered him: The reference is to a case <b>where</b> the respondent <b>said to this last</b> witness: <b>With regard to the one hundred dinars that I admitted</b> to owing <b>in your presence, I admitted</b> to owing <b>them in the presence of so-and-so,</b> the first witness, <b>as well.</b>

### Part 19
Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak asked: <b>Still, the last</b> witness <b>knows</b> that he is testifying about the same loan as the first witness, but <b>the first</b> witness <b>does not know</b> this. Since only one witness testifies that it is the same loan, the testimonies still cannot be combined.

### Part 20
Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, answered: It is a case <b>where,</b> after his admission to the second witness, the respondent <b>went back</b> and <b>said to the first</b> witness: With regard to <b>those one hundred dinars that I admitted</b> to owing <b>in your presence, I admitted</b> owing <b>them in the presence of so-and-so as well.</b> Therefore, both witnesses know that they are testifying about the same loan. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak <b>said to him: May your mind be settled, as you have settled my mind</b> and put it at ease by answering this question that was troubling me.

### Part 21
Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, <b>said to him: What is settling</b> about this explanation? <b>As Rava, and some say Rav Sheshet, threw an ax at</b> my answer, i.e., he rejected my explanation, as follows: According to this interpretation of the case of an admission following an admission, <b>isn’t this</b> the same as <b>an admission following a loan?</b> The case of an admission following an admission is now rendered superfluous, as it adds no new insight on the matter.

### Part 22
Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak <b>said to him: This is what I heard about you</b> Sages of Meḥoza, <b>that you knock down palm trees and erect them,</b> i.e., you build and then destroy what you built. After you came up with such an excellent explanation, you ruined it yourselves.

### Part 23
The Sages <b>of Neharde’a say: Whether</b> it is a case of <b>an admission following an admission, or an admission following a loan, or a loan following a loan, or a loan following an admission,</b> in all these cases the testimonies <b>are combined. In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa,</b> who teaches that since both witnesses testify about a debt of one hundred dinars, it is considered like one testimony.

### Part 24
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says: Testimony</b> of two witnesses <b>who contradict</b> the testimony of <b>each other in</b> response to the judges’ <b>examination</b> of the details of the story <b>is valid in</b> cases of <b>monetary law,</b> although a contradiction of this type disqualifies testimony in cases of capital law.

### Part 25
<b>Rava says: The statement of Rav Yehuda is reasonable in</b> a case where <b>one</b> witness <b>says:</b> The money was <b>in a black purse [<i>be’arnaki</i>], and</b> the other <b>one says:</b> It was <b>in a white purse.</b> Since this is a secondary detail, they may not remember it accurately. <b>But</b> if <b>one says:</b> He lent him <b>a black coin,</b> i.e., the coin was dark, <b>and</b> the other <b>one says:</b> He lent him <b>a white coin,</b> the testimonies <b>are not combined.</b> Since they contradict each other with regard to a characteristic of the money itself, one is probably lying.

### Part 26
The Gemara challenges Rabbi Yehuda’s ruling: <b>And</b> if witnesses contradict each other with regard to secondary details such as <b>a black purse in</b> cases of <b>capital law,</b> is it the case that their testimony is <b>not</b> accepted? <b>But doesn’t Rav Ḥisda say:</b> In a case where <b>one</b> of the witnesses <b>says:</b> The murderer <b>killed</b> the victim <b>with a sword, and one</b> of the witnesses <b>says:</b> The murderer <b>killed</b> the victim <b>with an <i>ariran</i>,</b> another type of weapon, <b>this is not congruent</b> testimony, as this is a clear contradiction. But if <b>one</b> of the witnesses <b>says:</b> The murderer’s <b>garments</b> were <b>black, and one</b> of the witnesses <b>says:</b> The murderer’s <b>garments</b> were <b>white, this is congruent</b> testimony, as this is not a meaningful discrepancy.
