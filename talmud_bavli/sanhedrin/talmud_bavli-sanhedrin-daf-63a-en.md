### Part 1
<b>Rabbi Ami says:</b> If one <b>sacrificed</b> an animal as an idolatrous offering <b>and burned</b> incense <b>and poured a libation,</b> all <b>in</b> the course of <b>one lapse of awareness, he is obligated</b> to bring <b>only one</b> sin-offering. <b>Abaye says: What is the reason for</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ami? The verse states: “Nor worship them”</b> (Exodus 20:5). <b>The verse renders all</b> the various rites of worship as <b>one rite.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>And does Abaye</b> actually <b>say this? But doesn’t Abaye say: Why</b> are there <b>three</b> mentions in the Torah of the prohibition against <b>bowing to</b> an object of <b>idol worship?</b> The prohibition against bowing to an idol appears three times: “You shall not bow to them nor worship them” (Exodus 20:5), “You shall not bow to their gods nor worship them” (Exodus 23:24), and “For you shall bow to no other god” (Exodus 34:14).

### Part 3
The reason is that <b>one</b> mention is <b>for</b> an idol for which bowing is <b>its</b> standard <b>manner</b> of worship, <b>and one</b> mention is a prohibition against bowing to an idol even if bowing is <b>not its</b> standard <b>manner</b> of worship, <b>and one</b> mention is <b>to divide</b> idol worship into categories, as one is obligated to bring an offering for every type of worship that he performed. Evidently, Abaye’s opinion is not in accordance with Rabbi Ami’s statement that one is obligated to bring one sin-offering for all of his acts of idol worship.

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: Abaye <b>stated</b> his reason <b>in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Ami, but</b> he <b>himself does not hold accordingly.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself</b> that <b>Abaye says: Why</b> are there <b>three</b> mentions of the prohibition against <b>bowing to</b> an object of <b>idol worship? One</b> is <b>for</b> an idol for which bowing is <b>its</b> standard <b>manner</b> of worship, <b>and one</b> is a prohibition against bowing to an idol even if bowing is <b>not its</b> standard <b>manner</b> of worship, <b>and one</b> mention is <b>to divide</b> idol worship into categories.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: Why is a verse necessary <b>for</b> the prohibition against bowing to an idol for which bowing is <b>its</b> standard <b>manner</b> of worship? That prohibition <b>is</b> already <b>derived from</b> the verse: “Take heed to yourself that you not be ensnared to follow them…saying, <b>how do these nations serve</b> their gods, so I will do likewise” (Deuteronomy 12:30), which indicates that one is liable for worshipping an idol in the manner that the gentiles worship it.

### Part 7
<b>Rather,</b> Abaye’s statement should be understood as follows: <b>One</b> mention of the prohibition is <b>for</b> an idol for which <b>its</b> typical <b>manner</b> of worship is similar to bowing in that the idol is worshipped in an honorable manner, <b>but</b> bowing is <b>not its</b> typical <b>manner</b> of worship, as it is not typically worshipped by bowing. <b>And one</b> mention is a prohibition against bowing to an idol even if it is <b>not</b> similar to <b>its</b> standard <b>manner</b> of worship at all. <b>And one</b> mention is <b>to divide</b> idol worship into categories.

### Part 8
§ The mishna includes among those liable for idol worship <b>one who</b> declares that he <b>accepts</b> an idol <b>upon himself as a god</b> and <b>one who says to</b> an idol: <b>You are my god. Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says</b> that <b>Rav says: Once</b> a person <b>said to</b> an idol: <b>You are my god,</b> he is <b>liable</b> even if he did not worship it.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: The transgressor is liable <b>to</b> receive <b>what</b> punishment? <b>If</b> he is liable <b>to</b> receive the <b>death</b> penalty, Rav’s statement is superfluous, as this <b>is</b> stated in <b>the mishna. Rather,</b> Rav means that one who does so unwittingly is obligated <b>to</b> bring <b>an offering.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is this statement true <b>even according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>is obligated</b> to bring a sin-offering for unwitting idol worship <b>only for a matter,</b> a transgression, <b>that involves an action, e.g., sacrificing</b> an offering, <b>or burning</b> incense, <b>or pouring</b> a libation, <b>or bowing? And Reish Lakish says: Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught bowing</b> among these examples? <b>It is Rabbi Akiva, who says</b> that <b>we do not require</b> a significant <b>action</b> in order to render one liable to bring a sin-offering; a minimal action is sufficient. <b>By inference, the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Akiva, <b>maintain</b> that <b>we require</b> a significant <b>action.</b> If bowing is not considered a significant action, then all the more so speech alone is not considered a significant action.

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: <b>Rav, too, when he states</b> that one who says to an idol: You are my god, is obligated to bring a sin-offering, <b>he states</b> this <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: If Rav states this <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that the transgressor is obligated to bring a sin-offering? <b>This is</b> identical to the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a blasphemer,</b> whom Rabbi Akiva obligates to bring an offering despite the lack of an action.

### Part 13
The Gemara answers: Rav states this <b>lest you say</b> that <b>Rabbi Akiva obligates</b> one to bring <b>an offering</b> for a transgression that does not involve an action <b>only in</b> the case of <b>a blasphemer, as it is written</b> explicitly <b>with regard to</b> a blasphemer that he receives <b><i>karet</i></b> in the verse: “He blasphemes the Lord, and that soul shall be excised [<i>nikhreta</i>] from among his people” (Numbers 15:30). <b>But here,</b> with regard to one who accepts an idol as his god, <b>where <i>karet</i> is not written</b> explicitly, one might <b>say</b> that he is <b>not</b> obligated to bring an offering.

### Part 14
Therefore, Rav <b>teaches us that</b> he is obligated to bring an offering, as the Torah <b>compares</b> the acceptance of an idol as a god to a case of active idol worship; <b>as it is written:</b> “They have made themselves a molten calf, <b>and have bowed to it, and have sacrificed to it, and said:</b> These are your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt” (Exodus 32:8).

### Part 15
With regard to the aforementioned verse, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Were it not for the <i>vav</i> in</b> the term: <b>“Which brought you up [<i>he’elukha</i>],”</b> giving it a plural form, <b>the haters of the Jewish people,</b> a euphemism used to refer to the Jewish people themselves, <b>would have been sentenced to destruction</b> for their idol worship. Since they recognized that God had taken them out of Egypt, and thought that He had merely made the golden calf His partner, the Jewish people were spared.

### Part 16
The Gemara comments: Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion is <b>like</b> one side of the following dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>: Others say: Were it not for the <i>vav</i> in</b> the term: <b>“Which brought you up [<i>he’elukha</i>],” the haters of the Jewish people would have been sentenced to destruction.</b>

### Part 17
<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai to him: But isn’t anyone who links the name of Heaven and something else,</b> a euphemism for an idol, <b>uprooted from the world? As it is stated:</b> “He who sacrifices to the gods, <b>save to the Lord only,</b> shall be utterly destroyed” (Exodus 22:19). The fact that the Jewish people included God in their idolatrous statement could not have saved them from destruction. <b>Rather, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Which brought you up”</b> in the plural? The verse teaches <b>that</b> the Jewish people <b>desired many gods;</b> they were not satisfied with the golden calf alone.

### Part 18
§ The mishna teaches: <b>But</b> with regard to <b>one who hugs</b> an idol, <b>or one who kisses</b> it, <b>or one who cleans</b> it, <b>or one who sprays</b> water before it, he transgresses a prohibition but is not liable to receive capital punishment. <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <b>Rabbi Elazar says: For all of</b> these actions one <b>is flogged, with the exception</b> of the cases stated later in the mishna <b>of one who vows in</b> an idol’s <b>name and one who affirms</b> his statement by an oath <b>in its name.</b>

### Part 19
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about these cases, <b>one who vows in</b> an idol’s <b>name and one who affirms</b> his statement by an oath <b>in its name, that</b> the transgressors <b>are not flogged?</b> It is <b>because they are</b> each an example of <b>a prohibition that does not involve an action. These</b> actions <b>too,</b> namely, hugging or kissing an idol and the like, are not punishable by lashes; one who performs them violates <b>a general prohibition, and one is not flogged for</b> violating <b>a general prohibition,</b> i.e., one that contains several prohibitions.

### Part 20
<b>As</b> this principle <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that one who eats from an animal before its soul departs is</b> in transgression <b>of a prohibition? The verse states: “You shall not eat with the blood”</b> (Leviticus 19:26), meaning, you shall not eat from the animal while its soul, which is referred to in the Torah as blood, is still within it.

### Part 21
The <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>Another matter</b> is derived from the verse <b>“You shall not eat with the blood”: You shall not eat</b> the <b>meat</b> of an offering <b>while</b> its <b>blood is still in the bowl,</b> as it has not yet been sprinkled on the altar. The meat of an offering may be eaten by the priests only after its blood is sprinkled.

### Part 22
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Dosa says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> although in general, after a deceased person is buried, the mourners are provided by others with a meal, others <b>do not provide</b> the mourners <b>with a meal</b> after the burial <b>of those executed by the court? The verse states: “You shall not eat with the blood,”</b> which is interpreted to mean: You shall not eat a mourners’ meal after the burial of one who was executed.

### Part 23
<b>Rabbi Akiva says: From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to a Sanhedrin that killed a soul,</b> i.e., that sentenced a person to death, <b>that</b> the judges <b>may not taste anything that entire day</b> that they sentenced him? <b>The verse states: “You shall not eat with the blood.”</b>

### Part 24
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: From where is</b> the <b>prohibition against</b> the behavior of <b>a stubborn and rebellious son</b> derived? While the Torah states the punishment given to a stubborn and rebellious son, the prohibition against his actions, namely, stealing money from his parents in order to eat a gluttonous meal of meat and wine in the company of lowly men, is not explicit. <b>The verse states: “You shall not eat with the blood,”</b> which is interpreted to mean that one may not eat in a manner that is punishable by death. This concludes the <i>baraita</i>.

### Part 25
<b>And Rabbi Avin bar Ḥiyya says, and some say</b> it is <b>Rabbi Avin bar Kahana</b> who says this: <b>For all of</b> the prohibitions that the Sages derive from this verse, one <b>is not flogged</b> for transgressing them, <b>as it is a general prohibition</b> that is referring to several different actions. Therefore, since the prohibition against hugging or kissing an idol is also derived from a general prohibition, it should not be punishable by lashes, contrary to the opinion of Rav Dimi.

### Part 26
<b>Rather, when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he related a different version of what <b>Rabbi Elazar says: For all of</b> the transgressions listed in the mishna one <b>is not flogged, with the exception of one who vows in</b> an idol’s <b>name and one who affirms</b> his statement by an oath <b>in its name.</b>

### Part 27
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different about</b> transgressing <b>those</b> prohibitions for <b>which one is not flogged?</b> It is <b>that they are</b> each an example of <b>a general prohibition,</b> as explained previously. <b>These</b> cases <b>too,</b> namely, one who vows or takes an oath in the name of an idol, <b>are</b> included in <b>a prohibition that does not involve an action,</b> and therefore the transgressors are not punishable by lashes.

### Part 28
The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> <i>halakha</i> of Rabbi Eliezer’s is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who says</b> with regard to <b>a prohibition that does not involve an action</b> that <b>one is flogged for</b> violating <b>it.</b>

### Part 29
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the Paschal offering: The verse states: <b>“And you shall not leave any of it until morning;</b> but that which remains of it until morning you shall burn with fire” (Exodus 12:10). <b>The verse comes to provide a positive</b> mitzva to burn the leftover meat <b>after the prohibition</b> against leaving it over was violated,
