### Part 1
“It is a people that shall dwell alone, <b>and shall not be reckoned among the nations”</b> (Numbers 23:9), teaching that where the verse mentions “the nations,” the Jewish people are not included.

### Part 2
The Gemara cites a related statement: <b>Rabbi Elazar raises a contradiction: It is written</b> in one verse: <b>“The Lord is good to all</b> and His compassion is over all His works” (Psalms 145:9), <b>and it is written</b> in a different verse: <b>“The Lord is good to those who wait for Him,</b> to the soul that seeks Him” (Lamentations 3:25). He explains: This can be <b>compared to a person who has an orchard. When he waters</b> it, <b>he waters all of it.</b> Perforce, the water reaches all parts of the orchard, and he cannot discriminate between trees. This is the meaning of the verse: “The Lord is good to all.” By contrast, <b>when he hoes</b> around the trees, <b>he hoes only</b> around <b>the good</b> trees <b>among them.</b> Similarly, when God bestows goodness to the world, all receive it. When He protects people from harm, not all are protected.

### Part 3
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Therefore,</b> since all humanity descends from one person, <b>each and every</b> person is obligated to say: The world was created for me. The mishna then teaches that the court says to the witnesses: And perhaps you will say: Why would we want to be responsible for the blood of this person? But be aware, as is it not already stated: “When the wicked perish, there is song” (Proverbs 11:10)? The Gemara teaches: A separate verse relates that after the evil king Ahab was killed: <b>“And the song went throughout the camp”</b> (I Kings 22:36). <b>Rabbi Aḥa bar Ḥanina says:</b> The fact that the verse states “the song,” and not a song, indicates that it is referring to a song mentioned elsewhere. Accordingly, the verse: <b>“When the wicked perish, there is song,”</b> alludes to this episode: <b>When Ahab ben Omri perished,</b> there was <b>song.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>But is the Holy One, Blessed be He, gladdened by the downfall of the wicked? Isn’t it written</b> in the verse describing the victory of the Jewish people in battle: “He appointed them that should sing unto the Lord, and praise in the beauty of holiness, <b>as they went out before the army, and say: Give thanks to the Lord, for His mercy endures forever”</b> (II Chronicles 20:21). <b>And Rabbi Yonatan says: For what</b> reason <b>is it not stated in this praise:</b> “Give thanks to the Lord <b>for He is good,</b> for His mercy endures forever,” as is stated elsewhere, e.g., Psalms 118:1? This is <b>because the Holy One, Blessed be He, is not gladdened by the downfall of the wicked.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara comments: <b>As Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written</b> in the passage describing the splitting of the Red Sea: <b>“And the one came not near the other all the night”</b> (Exodus 14:20)? <b>At that time the ministering angels desired to recite a song before the Holy One, Blessed be He. The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to them: My handiwork,</b> i.e., the Egyptians, <b>are drowning in the sea, and you are reciting a song before Me?</b> Apparently, God is not gladdened by the downfall of the wicked.

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina says: He,</b> i.e., God, <b>does not rejoice</b> in their downfall, <b>but He</b> does <b>cause others</b> to feel <b>joy.</b> The Gemara comments: Accordingly, the language of the verse <b>is also precise, as it is written:</b> “And it shall come to pass, that as the Lord rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you; so the Lord <b>will cause rejoicing [<i>yasis</i>]</b> over you to cause you to perish” (Deuteronomy 28:63), <b>and it is not written: Will have joy [<i>yasus</i>].</b> The term “<i>yasis</i>” connotes causing joy to others, not that God will experience joy Himself. The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from</b> this inference that it is so.

### Part 7
Apropos the death of Ahab, the Gemara cites another verse from that passage. The verse states: “And they washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria, and the dogs licked up his blood; <b>and the harlots also washed</b> themselves there, according to the word of the Lord that He spoke” (I Kings 22:38). <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> “The harlots [<i>hazzonot</i>]” can be read as visions [<i>ḥezyonot</i>], and the verse means: <b>To cleanse,</b> i.e., to fulfill, <b>two visions, one of Micaiah and one of Elijah.</b> This fulfills a vision <b>of Micaiah,</b> as it <b>is written: “If you return at all in peace, the Lord has not spoken by me”</b> (I Kings 22:28). Once Ahab died, Micaiah’s vision was fulfilled. This also fulfills a vision <b>of Elijah,</b> as it <b>is written: “In the place where the dogs licked the blood of Naboth</b> shall the dogs lick your blood, even yours” (I Kings 21:19).

### Part 8
<b>Rava says:</b> The verse is speaking of <b>actual harlots. Ahab was a frigid man,</b> who did not lust for women. <b>And Jezebel,</b> his wife, <b>fashioned two forms of harlots for him in his chariot, in order that he see them</b> while traveling <b>and become aroused.</b> Accordingly, one would understand the verse as stating that the harlots were washed, not that they washed themselves.

### Part 9
The verse describing the death of Ahab states: <b>“And a certain man drew a bow offhandedly [<i>letummo</i>] and smote</b> the king of Israel” (I Kings 22:34). <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> “<i>Letummo</i>” should be understood as <b>offhandedly [<i>lefi tummo</i>],</b> without aiming for Ahab. <b>Rava says:</b> This alludes to the fact that the killing of Ahab served <b>to make whole</b> [<b><i>letammem</i>] two visions, one of Micaiah and one of Elijah.</b>

### Part 10
§ Before continuing its discussion of Ahab, the Gemara records <b>a mnemonic</b> for the forthcoming statements: <b>Called; and merited; of Edom.</b> It <b>is written: “And Ahab called Obadiah, who was over the household; now Obadiah feared the Lord greatly”</b> (I Kings 18:3). The Gemara asks: <b>What is the verse saying?</b> What is the connection between Obadiah’s fear of the Lord and the call of Ahab?

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says</b> that Ahab <b>said to</b> Obadiah: It <b>is written with regard to Jacob:</b> “And Laban said to him: If now I have found favor in your eyes, <b>I have observed the signs, and the Lord has blessed me for your sake”</b> (Genesis 30:27). It <b>is written with regard to Joseph: “The Lord blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake”</b> (Genesis 39:5). <b>The house of that man,</b> i.e., my house, <b>was not blessed. Perhaps you do not fear God?</b> Immediately, <b>a Divine Voice emerged and said: “Now Obadiah feared the Lord greatly,” but the house of Ahab is not fit for blessing</b> like the houses of those masters.

### Part 12
<b>Rabbi Abba says:</b> The praise <b>that is stated with regard to Obadiah</b> is <b>greater than that which is stated with regard to Abraham. As with regard to Abraham</b> the verse states: “For now I know that you fear God” (Genesis 22:12), and the term <b>“greatly” is not written, and about Obadiah</b> the term <b>“greatly” is written.</b>

### Part 13
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: For what</b> reason <b>did Obadiah merit prophecy?</b> It is <b>because he concealed one hundred prophets in a cave, as it is stated: “It was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the Lord, that Obadiah took one hundred prophets, and hid them, fifty men in a cave,</b> and fed them with bread and water” (I Kings 18:4). The Gemara asks: <b>What is different,</b> i.e., why did he decide, to conceal <b>fifty men</b> in each of two caves and not conceal them all together in one cave? <b>Rabbi Elazar says: He learned from</b> the behavior of <b>Jacob</b> to do so, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And he said: If Esau comes to the one camp and smites it, <b>then the camp that is left shall escape”</b> (Genesis 32:9). Obadiah learned from this to divide the prophets and thereby lessen the danger. <b>Rabbi Abbahu says:</b> It is <b>because there is no cave</b> big enough <b>to contain more than fifty</b> people.

### Part 14
The verse states: <b>“The vision of Obadiah. So says the Lord God concerning Edom:</b> We have heard a message from the Lord, and an ambassador is sent among the nations: Arise, and let us rise up against her in battle” (Obadiah 1:1). The Gemara asks: <b>What is different,</b> i.e., what is the reason, that specifically <b>Obadiah</b> prophesied <b>concerning Edom?</b>

### Part 15
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: The Holy One, Blessed be He, said: Let Obadiah come, who dwells among two wicked</b> ones, Ahab and Jezebel, <b>but did not learn from their actions; and he will prophesy concerning Esau the wicked,</b> the progenitor of Edom, <b>who dwelled among two righteous</b> ones, Isaac and Rebekkah, <b>but did not learn from their actions. Efrayim Miksha’a, a student of Rabbi Meir, said in the name of Rabbi Meir: Obadiah was an Edomite convert.</b> Consequently, he prophesied with regard to Edom. <b>And this is as people say: From and within the forest comes the ax to it,</b> as the handle for the ax that chops the tree is from the forest itself.

### Part 16
The verse states concerning King David: <b>“And he smote Moab and measured them with the line, making them lie down on the ground</b> and he measured two lines to put to death” (II Samuel 8:2). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: This is as people say: From and within the forest comes the ax to it,</b> as King David was a descendant of Ruth the Moabite. <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael <b>he stated</b> something similar to this: <b>A thigh rots from within,</b> i.e., when a piece of meat rots, the rotting begins from the inner part of it. Here too, the punishment is administered by one descended from that very nation.

### Part 17
§ The Gemara cites a verse concerning the king of Moab: <b>“Then he took his eldest son, who should have reigned in his stead, and sacrificed him for a burnt offering upon the wall;</b> and there was great indignation against Israel, and they departed from him and returned to their own land” (II Kings 3:27). <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> engage in a dispute concerning this. <b>One says:</b> The king sacrificed his son <b>for the sake of Heaven, and one says:</b> The king sacrificed his son <b>for the sake of idol worship.</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> that he sacrificed him <b>for the sake of Heaven, this is as it is written: “And there was great indignation against Israel,”</b> as the gentile attempted to honor God according to his understanding, while the Jewish people were straying from worshipping God, leading to God’s anger against them. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that he sacrificed him <b>for the sake of idol worship, why</b> would the verse state: <b>“And there was…indignation”?</b>

### Part 19
The Gemara answers: This can be understood <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi. As Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi raises a contradiction: It is written</b> concerning the Jewish people: “You have not walked in My statutes, neither have you kept My ordinances; <b>nor have you done according to the statutes of the nations that are round about you”</b> (Ezekiel 5:7), <b>and it is</b> also <b>written: “You have done according to the statutes of the nations that are round about you”</b> (Ezekiel 11:12). Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi explains: <b>You did not act like the proper ones among</b> the nations, but <b>you did act like the flawed ones among them.</b> Here as well, the Jewish people learned from the king of Moab to engage in human sacrifice.

### Part 20
The Gemara discusses the end of that verse: <b>“And they departed from him and returned to their own land [<i>la’aretz</i>]”</b> (II Kings 3:27). <b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa says: At that time the enemies of the Jewish people,</b> a euphemism for the Jewish people themselves, <b>descended to the lowest level.</b> He interprets “<i>la’aretz</i>” to mean: To the earth, teaching that the Jewish people were as low as the dust of the earth.

### Part 21
The chapter closes with the explication of a verse stated with regard to Abishag, who attended King David before his death: <b>“And the damsel was very fair [<i>yafa ad me’od</i> ]”</b> (I Kings 1:4). <b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa says: She still did not reach half the beauty of Sarah, as it is written:</b> “<i>Ad me’od</i>,” which can be translated as <b>“up to very</b> fair,” <b>but not including</b> the praise of <b>“very</b> fair.” By contrast, it is written concerning Sarah: “She was very fair” (Genesis 12:14).
