### Part 1
whereas <b>the subcategories</b> of labor that are derived from them, e.g., watering, <b>were not prohibited by the Merciful One,</b> i.e., by Torah law, but only by rabbinic law; and in a case of loss the Sages were lenient. The source for this distinction is <b>as it is written: “But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land,</b> a sabbath for the Lord: <b>Your field you shall not sow,</b> and your vineyard you shall not prune. That which grows of its own accord of your harvest you shall not reap, nor gather the grapes of your undressed vines” (Leviticus 25:4–5).

### Part 2
<b>Since pruning is included in</b> the principal category of <b>sowing,</b> as its objective is to encourage the plant’s growth, <b>and picking</b> grapes <b>is included in</b> the principal category of <b>reaping</b> grain, as both involve removal of produce from a plant, <b>for</b> the purpose of teaching <b>what <i>halakha</i> did the Merciful One write them?</b> Why did the Torah explicitly prohibit pruning and picking grapes, rather than sufficing with the general prohibitions against sowing and reaping?

### Part 3
The Gemara answers that these were individually enumerated <b>to say</b> that only <b>for these subcategories</b> of labor <b>is one liable</b> to be flogged, while <b>for other</b> subcategories of labor, i.e., watering a field, <b>one is not liable.</b> Consequently, there are only four types of labor that are prohibited by Torah law during the Sabbatical Year: Sowing and its subcategory of pruning, as well as reaping and its subcategory of grape picking. All other subcategories of labor are prohibited only by rabbinic decree.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is there really <b>no</b> liability for other subcategories of labor? <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Your field you shall not sow, and your vineyard you shall not prune”</b> (Leviticus 25:4). <b>I have</b> derived from here an explicit prohibition <b>only</b> against <b>sowing and pruning. From where</b> do I derive that <b>weeding,</b> i.e., uprooting weeds, <b>hoeing, and cutting weeds,</b> even without uprooting them, are also prohibited? <b>The verse states: “Your field</b> you shall <b>not</b> sow” and <b>“your vineyard</b> you shall <b>not</b> prune.” This wording indicates that <b>no labor</b> may be performed <b>in your field, and no labor</b> may be performed <b>in your vineyard.</b>

### Part 5
Similarly, <b>from where</b> is it derived that <b>one may not prune trees, and one may not trim dry branches</b> from trees, <b>and one</b> may <b>not cut large branches [<i>mefasegin</i>] from trees? The verse states: “Your field</b> you shall <b>not</b> sow” and <b>“your vineyard</b> you shall <b>not</b> prune,” thereby teaching that <b>no labor</b> may be performed <b>in your field, and no labor</b> may be performed <b>in your vineyard.</b>

### Part 6
Similarly, <b>from where</b> is it derived that <b>one</b> may <b>not fertilize</b> fields and vineyards, <b>and one may not remove stones</b> that surround the base of a tree and impede its growth, <b>and one</b> may <b>not</b> cover exposed roots with <b>dust, and one may not fumigate a tree</b> in order to exterminate worms? <b>The verse states: “Your field</b> you shall <b>not</b> sow” and <b>“your vineyard</b> you shall <b>not</b> prune,” thereby indicating that <b>no labor</b> may be performed <b>in your field, and no labor</b> may be performed <b>in your vineyard.</b>

### Part 7
The apparent conclusion from this is that all labor in a field or a vineyard is prohibited. One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one may</b> also <b>not hoe lightly under olive</b> trees <b>and one may not hoe under grapevines, and one may not fill cracks</b> in the ground <b>with water, and one may not construct circular ditches</b> around the bases of <b>grapevines</b> in order to collect rainwater. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Your field you shall not sow.”</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara explains the derivation: <b>Sowing was included</b> in the general prohibition against performing agricultural labors during the Sabbatical Year, as the verse states “But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land” (Leviticus 25:4). <b>Why was</b> sowing <b>singled out</b> and mentioned explicitly? In order <b>to compare</b> other types of labor <b>to it</b> and to <b>say to you: Just as sowing is unique in that it is labor</b> performed both <b>in the field and in the vineyard, so too, any</b> other <b>labor</b> performed both <b>in the field and in the vineyard</b> is prohibited. However, labors performed only in the vineyard but not in the field, i.e., whose objective is merely to sustain the vines from year to year, such as the labors mentioned above, are permitted. In any case, this <i>baraita</i> indicates that many subcategories of labor are prohibited during the seventh year, and not just sowing and pruning, as Rava had stated.

### Part 9
The Gemara rejects this opinion: These labors, with the exceptions of sowing, pruning, grape picking, and reaping, are all prohibited only <b>by rabbinic law, and the verse</b> that is cited as a source from the Torah <b>is a mere support,</b> and not a bona fide source.

### Part 10
Incidental to this discussion, the Gemara asks: <b>Is</b> light <b>hoeing</b> under olive trees in fact <b>permitted during the Sabbatical Year? Isn’t it written: “But the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie fallow”</b> (Exodus 23:11), and it is taught with regard to this verse: <b>“You shall let it rest” from light hoeing, “and lie fallow” from clearing</b> the field of <b>stones.</b> This indicates that light hoeing is indeed prohibited during the Sabbatical Year.

### Part 11
<b>Rav Ukva bar Ḥama said: There are two</b> types of light <b>hoeing, one</b> whose objective is <b>to strengthen</b> the <b>trees, and another</b> that is intended <b>to seal cracks.</b> There is a practical halakhic difference between them: Hoeing performed in order <b>to strengthen the tree is prohibited,</b> as it is similar to plowing in that it enhances the tree’s growth. However, hoeing undertaken in order <b>to seal cracks is permitted,</b> as by doing so one prevents damage to the tree.

### Part 12
§ <b>It was stated</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar</b> disagreed with regard to <b>one who plows during the Sabbatical Year. One said: He is flogged</b> for doing so, <b>while the</b> other <b>one said: He is not flogged.</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that they disagree with regard to</b> the principle that <b>Rabbi Avin</b> said that <b>Rabbi Ile’a said,</b> and one accepts this principle while the other does not. <b>As, Rabbi Avin said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ile’a said: Wherever a generalization is stated</b> in the Torah <b>as a positive</b> mitzva, <b>and a detail</b> relating to that generalization is stated <b>as a negative</b> mitzva, <b>one does not apply</b> the hermeneutical principle of <b>a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization,</b> according to which the <i>halakha</i> under discussion is expanded to all cases that resemble the detail.

### Part 13
The Gemara explains: <b>The one who said</b> that one who plows during the Sabbatical Year <b>is flogged does not</b> accept the principle <b>that Rabbi Avin</b> said that <b>Rabbi Ile’a said.</b> Accordingly, he expounds the verses as follows: The verse “But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land” (Leviticus 25:4) is a generalization stated as a positive mitzva. The continuation of the verse is “Your field you shall not sow,” which is a detail stated as a negative mitzva. This is followed by another generalization: “For it shall be a year of rest for the land” (Leviticus 25:5). By applying the principle of a generalization, a detail, and a generalization, one can derive that there is a prohibition against performing any agricultural task that is similar to sowing, including plowing.

### Part 14
<b>And the one who said</b> that <b>one is not flogged</b> for plowing <b>holds</b> in accordance with the ruling <b>that Rabbi Avin</b> stated in the name of Rabbi Ile’a. Therefore, the prohibition stated as a detail, i.e., the prohibition against sowing, is not extended to include any other labor. One who plows violates the positive command to let the land rest, but does not transgress a Torah law phrased as a negative mitzva, and therefore he is not flogged.

### Part 15
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No,</b> one can say that <b>everyone</b> holds that the <i>halakha</i> <b>is not</b> in accordance with the principle <b>that Rabbi Avin</b> said that <b>Rabbi Ile’a said.</b> According to <b>the one who said he is flogged,</b> all is <b>well,</b> as he applies the hermeneutical principle of a generalization, a detail, and a generalization to derive a prohibition for plowing.

### Part 16
<b>And the one who said</b> that <b>he is not flogged</b> could have <b>said to you: Since pruning is</b> included <b>in</b> the primary category of <b>sowing, and</b> grape <b>picking is</b> included in the primary category <b>of reaping, for</b> the purpose of teaching <b>what <i>halakha</i> did the Merciful One write them?</b> They were individually enumerated <b>to say</b> that only <b>for these</b> specific <b>subcategories</b> of labor <b>is one liable</b> to be flogged, but <b>for</b> performing <b>other subcategories</b> of labor <b>one is not liable.</b> According to this opinion, the verse comes to teach that one is not liable to be flogged for performing any labor not explicitly enumerated in the Torah, including plowing.

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is there really <b>no</b> liability for other subcategories of labor? <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse <b>“Your field you shall not sow, and your vineyard you shall not prune”</b> that <b>I have</b> derived from here an explicit prohibition <b>only</b> against <b>sowing and pruning? From where</b> do I derive that <b>weeding, hoeing, and cutting weeds</b> are also prohibited? <b>The verse states: “Your field</b> you shall <b>not</b> sow and <b>your vineyard</b> you shall <b>not</b> prune” (Leviticus 25:4). By placing the word “not” immediately following the words “field” and “vineyard,” the verse indicates that one may <b>not</b> perform <b>any labor that</b> is generally performed <b>in your field, and</b> one may <b>not</b> perform <b>any labor that</b> is generally performed <b>in your vineyard.</b>

### Part 18
Similarly, <b>from where</b> is it derived that <b>one may not prune trees, and one may not trim dry branches</b> from trees, <b>and one</b> may <b>not cut large branches from trees? The verse states: “Your field</b> you shall <b>not</b> sow and <b>your vineyard</b> you shall <b>not</b> prune,” indicating that <b>any labor</b> that is generally performed <b>in your field may not</b> be performed during the Sabbatical Year, <b>and any labor</b> generally performed <b>in your vineyard may not</b> be performed during the Sabbatical Year.

### Part 19
<b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>one may not fertilize</b> fields and vineyards, <b>and one may not remove stones</b> from around the base of a tree that impede its growth, <b>and one may not fumigate a tree</b> in order to exterminate worms? <b>The verse states: “Your field</b> you shall <b>not</b> sow and <b>your vineyard</b> you shall <b>not</b> prune,” thereby indicating that <b>any labor</b> that is generally performed <b>in your field may not</b> be performed during the Sabbatical Year, <b>and any labor</b> generally performed <b>in your vineyard may not</b> be performed during the Sabbatical Year.

### Part 20
One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one may</b> also <b>not hoe</b> lightly <b>under olive</b> trees <b>and one may not hoe under grapevines, and one may not fill cracks</b> in the ground <b>with water, and one may not construct circular ditches</b> around the bases of <b>grapevines</b> in order to collect rainwater. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Your field you shall not sow.”</b>

### Part 21
<b>Sowing was included</b> in the general prohibition against performing agricultural labors during the Sabbatical Year. <b>Why was</b> sowing <b>singled out</b> and mentioned explicitly? In order <b>to compare</b> other types of labor <b>to</b> it and to <b>say to you: Just as sowing is unique in that it is labor</b> performed both <b>in the field and in the vineyard, so too, any other labor</b> performed both <b>in the field and in the vineyard</b> is prohibited. However, labor performed only in the vineyard, but not in the field, i.e., whose objective is merely to sustain the vines from year to year, is permitted. In any case, this <i>baraita</i> indicates that many labors are prohibited during the seventh year, and not just sowing and pruning.

### Part 22
The Gemara rejects this opinion: These labors, with the exceptions of sowing, pruning, grape picking, and reaping, are all prohibited only <b>by rabbinic law, and the verse</b> that is cited as source from the Torah <b>is a mere support,</b> and not a bona fide source.
