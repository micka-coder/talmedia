### Part 1
Rav Ashi challenged him: <b>However, if</b> that is <b>so,</b> one should be required to stand while performing the ritual through which the brother-in-law frees the <i>yevama</i> of her levirate bonds [<i>ḥalitza</i>], as the verse states: <b>“And if he stands and he says: I do not wish to take her”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:8). <b>Here</b> must he <b>also</b> stand for the ceremony? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <i>ḥalitza</i> may be performed <b>whether</b> the man is <b>sitting, or standing, or reclining?</b>

### Part 2
<b>He said to him: There,</b> in the case of <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>it is not written: And he will stand and he will say,</b> which would imply an obligation to stand; whereas <b>here,</b> in the case of rending, <b>it is written: “Then</b> Job <b>arose, and rent</b> his coat” (Job 1:20).

### Part 3
<b>Rami bar Ḥama said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that rending must be</b> performed while <b>standing? As it is stated: “Then Job arose, and tore</b> his coat” (Job 1:20). The Gemara asks: <b>Perhaps he did something extra</b> beyond what is required, and actually there is no obligation to stand; <b>as, if you do not say</b> that he did more than what was required of him, then how do you explain the continuation of the verse: <b>“And he shaved his head”</b> (Job 1:20)? Is every mourner required to act in <b>this</b> manner <b>also</b> and shave his head?

### Part 4
The Gemara concludes: <b>Rather,</b> this source must be rejected, and instead the <i>halakha</i> is derived <b>from here,</b> the verse that describes David’s mourning over his son: <b>“Then the king arose, and rent his garments”</b> (II Samuel 13:31). The Gemara asks: But <b>perhaps he</b> too <b>did something extra</b> beyond what is required, and he was not actually obligated to stand; <b>as, if you do not say</b> that he did more than what was required of him, then how do you explain the continuation of the verse: <b>“And he lay on the earth”</b> (II Samuel 13:31)? Is every mourner required to act in <b>this</b> manner <b>also?</b>

### Part 5
<b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a mourner <b>sat on a bed,on a chair, on a large mortar [<i>udyanei</i>], or on the ground, he does not fulfill his obligation through any of them. And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> This is <b>because he did not fulfill</b> his obligation to <b>overturn his bed,</b> even if he lay on the ground. This indicates that there is no requirement whatsoever to lie on the ground.

### Part 6
Ameimar <b>said to</b> Rav Ashi: The verse does not mean that David actually lay on the ground. Rather, it was <b>as if</b> he were <b>on the ground,</b> since he overturned his bed and brought it closer to the ground. If this is the case, then Ameimar acted correctly, and a mourner should rend his garments while standing.

### Part 7
§ <b>The Sages taught: These are the activities that a mourner is prohibited from</b> engaging <b>in: He is prohibited from working, and from bathing, and from anointing</b> himself with oil, <b>and from engaging in sexual relations, and from wearing shoes. And he is prohibited from reading in the Torah, and in the Prophets, and in the Writings, and from studying in the Mishna, in the midrash, and in the <i>halakhot</i>, and in the Talmud, and in the <i>aggadot</i>. But if the public needs him</b> to teach them these things, <b>he need not refrain</b> from doing so. <b>There was an incident that the son of Rabbi Yosei died in Tzippori, and</b> Rabbi Yosei <b>entered the study hall and expounded</b> there <b>for the entire day.</b>

### Part 8
It was related that <b>a calamity,</b> i.e., a death in the family, once <b>befell Rabba bar bar Ḥana,</b> and <b>he thought not to go out to</b> deliver <b>his exposition. Rabbi Ḥanina said to him:</b> Is it not taught that <b>if the public needs him</b> to teach them these things, <b>one need not refrain</b> from doing so? <b>He</b> then <b>thought to place an interpreter alongside him,</b> who would sound his words to the public, as was normally done for such an exposition. <b>Rav said to him: It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> similarly: <b>Provided that he does not place the disseminator</b> alongside him.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>But how,</b> then, should he <b>act</b> so that he can be heard? The Gemara answers: It is <b>like that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident and the son of Rabbi Yehuda bar Ilai died, and</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>entered the study hall. And Rabbi Ḥananya ben Akavya</b> entered after him and <b>sat by his side.</b> Rabbi Yehuda bar Ilai then <b>whispered</b> his lecture <b>to Rabbi Ḥananya ben Akavya, and Rabbi Ḥananya ben Akavya</b> whispered it <b>to the disseminator, and the disseminator sounded to the public</b> what had been told to him. In this way, it became known that Rabbi Yehuda bar Ilai was in mourning.

### Part 10
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: For <b>the first three days, a mourner is prohibited from donning phylacteries. From the third</b> day <b>and on, and including the third</b> day, <b>he is permitted to don phylacteries. And if new faces,</b> i.e., people who had not yet come to console him, <b>come, he need not remove</b> them, although these people may falsely conclude that he had also donned phylacteries during the first two days of his mourning; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Yehoshua says: For the first two days, a mourner is prohibited from donning</b> phylacteries. <b>From the second</b> day, <b>and including the second</b> day, <b>he is permitted to wear</b> phylacteries. <b>But if new faces come in</b> to console him, <b>he must remove</b> his phylacteries.

### Part 11
<b>Rav Mattana said: What is the reason of Rabbi Eliezer? As it is written: “And the days of weeping and mourning for Moses ended”</b> (Deuteronomy 34:8). The plural term “days” implies a minimum of two, and it indicates that the main portion of the mourning period is the first two full days. <b>Rav Eina said: What is the reason of Rabbi Yehoshua? As it is written:</b> “And I will make it as the mourning for an only son, <b>and its end as a bitter day”</b> (Amos 8:10), i.e., a single “day.”

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>But also</b> for <b>Rabbi Yehoshua, isn’t it written</b> in the Torah: <b>“And the days</b> of weeping and mourning for Moses <b>ended,”</b> thereby implying that this period lasts for two days? The Gemara answers: He could have <b>said to you</b> that <b>Moses was different, because the mourning for him was more intense,</b> and the people mourned for him longer than usual. The Gemara asks: <b>But also</b> for <b>Rabbi Eliezer, isn’t it written</b> in the Torah: <b>“And its end as a bitter day”?</b> The Gemara answers: He could have said to you that <b>the main bitterness is</b> only <b>one day,</b> but the severity of the mourning lasts for two days.

### Part 13
<b>Ulla said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer with regard to</b> the <b>removal</b> of phylacteries. A mourner need not remove them when new people come in to console him. <b>And the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua with regard to the donning</b> of phylacteries, and so a mourner may already don phylacteries on the second day.

### Part 14
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the scholars: <b>According</b> to <b>Ulla,</b> who rules in accordance with Rabbi Yehoshua that a mourner may don phylacteries <b>on</b> his second <b>day</b> of mourning, is the mourner required to <b>remove</b> them if new people arrive on that day, <b>or</b> is he <b>not</b> required to <b>remove</b> them?

### Part 15
The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> what <b>Ulla said</b> explicitly: <b>One removes</b> his phylacteries when new people come to console him, <b>and he dons</b> them again when they leave, <b>even</b> if he must don and remove them <b>a hundred times. This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Yehuda ben Teima says: He removes</b> his phylacteries <b>and dons</b> them again, <b>even</b> if he must do so <b>a hundred times.</b>

### Part 16
<b>Rava said: Once he dons</b> his phylacteries, <b>he does not remove</b> them <b>again.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But wasn’t it Rava</b> himself who <b>said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the <i>tanna</i></b> of <b>our</b> mishna, who <b>said</b> that the most serious period of mourning is <b>three</b> days? How then does he rule in accordance with the <i>baraita</i> that a mourner may don phylacteries during these days?
