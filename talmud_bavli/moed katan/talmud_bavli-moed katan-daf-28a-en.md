### Part 1
with regard to <b>a woman</b> who died <b>in childbirth,</b> and therefore continues to bleed. <b>But</b> the biers of <b>other women may be set down</b> in the street.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Elazar said: Even</b> the biers of <b>other women</b> must not be set down in the street, <b>as it is written: “And Miriam died there and was buried there”</b> (Numbers 20:1), which teaches that <b>the</b> site of her <b>burial was close to</b> the place of her <b>death.</b> Therefore, it is preferable to bury a woman as close as possible to the place where she died.

### Part 3
With regard to that same verse <b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> further: <b>Miriam also died by</b> the divine <b>kiss,</b> just like her brother Moses. What is the source for this? <b>This is derived</b> through a verbal analogy between the word <b>“there”</b> stated with regard to Miriam and the word <b>“there”</b> mentioned <b>with regard to Moses.</b>With regard to Moses it says: “So Moses the servant of the Lord died there in the land of Moab by the mouth of the Lord” (Deuteronomy 34:5). <b>For what</b> reason <b>was it not</b> explicitly <b>stated with regard to her,</b> as it is stated with regard to Moses, that she died <b>“by the mouth of the Lord”?</b> It is <b>because it would be unseemly to say such a thing,</b> that a woman died by way of a divine kiss, and therefore it is not said explicitly.

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Ami said: Why was</b> the Torah portion that describes the <b>death of Miriam juxtaposed to the portion</b> dealing with <b>the red heifer? To tell you: Just as the red heifer atones</b> for sin, <b>so too, the death of the righteous atones</b> for sin. <b>Rabbi Elazar said: Why was</b> the Torah portion that describes the <b>death of Aaron juxtaposed to</b> the portion discussing <b>the priestly garments?</b> This teaches that <b>just as the priestly garments atone</b> for sin, <b>so too, the death of the righteous atones</b> for sin.

### Part 5
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>dies suddenly</b> without having been sick, <b>this is death</b> through <b>snatching.</b> If he <b>became sick for a day and died, this is an expedited death. Rabbi Ḥananya ben Gamliel says: This is death at a stroke, as it is stated: “Son of man, behold, I am about to take away from you the delight of your eyes at a stroke”</b> (Ezekiel 24:16). <b>And</b> when this prophecy is fulfilled <b>it is written: “So I spoke to the people in the morning and at evening my wife died”</b> (Ezekiel 24:18).

### Part 6
If he was sick for <b>two days and died, this is a quickened death.</b> If he was sick for <b>three</b> days and died, this is a death of <b>rebuke.</b> If he died after being sick for <b>four</b> days, this is a death of <b>reprimand.</b> If one died after a sickness lasting <b>five</b> days, <b>this is the</b> ordinary <b>death of all people.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Ḥanin said: What is the verse</b> from which this is derived? It is stated: <b>“Behold, your days approach that you must die”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:14). This verse is expounded in the following manner: <b>“Behold [<i>hen</i>]”</b> indicates <b>one; “approach [<i>karvu</i>],”</b> a plural term, indicates <b>two; “your days [<i>yamekha</i>],”</b> also a plural term, indicates another <b>two;</b> and therefore in total <b>this is five.</b> How does the word <b><i>hen</i></b> indicate <b>one? Because in the Greek language they call</b> the number <b>one <i>hen</i>.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara discusses the significance of death at different ages: If one <b>dies when</b> he is <b>fifty years</b> old, <b>this is death through <i>karet</i>,</b> the divine punishment of excision, meted out for the most serious transgressions.If he dies when he is <b>fifty-two years</b> old, <b>this is the death of Samuel from Ramah.</b> If he dies at the age of <b>sixty, this is death at the hand of Heaven.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Mar Zutra said: What is the verse</b> from which this is derived? <b>As it is written: “You shall come to your grave in a ripe age [<i>bekhelaḥ</i>]”</b> (Job 5:26). The word <b>“ripe age” [<i>bekhelaḥ</i>] has the numerical value of sixty,</b> and it is alluded to there that dying at this age involves a divine punishment.

### Part 10
One who dies at the age of <b>seventy</b> has reached <b>old age.</b> One who dies at the age of <b>eighty</b> dies in <b>strength, as it is written: “The days of our years are seventy, or if by reason of strength, eighty years”</b> (Psalms 90:10). <b>Rabba said:</b> Not only is death at the age of fifty a sign of <i>karet</i>, but even death <b>from fifty to sixty years</b> of age <b>is death by <i>karet</i>. And</b> the reason that <b>all of these years were not counted</b> in connection with <i>karet</i> is <b>due to the honor of Samuel from Ramah,</b> who died at the age of fifty-two.

### Part 11
The Gemara relates that <b>when Rav Yosef turned sixty he made a holiday for the Sages.</b> Explaining the cause for his celebration, <b>he said: I have passed</b> the age of <b><i>karet</i>. Abaye said to him: Master,</b> even <b>though you have passed the <i>karet</i> of years, have you, Master, escaped the <i>karet</i> of days?</b> As previously mentioned, sudden death is also considered to be a form of <i>karet</i>. <b>He said to him: Grasp at least half in your hand,</b> for I have at least escaped one type of <i>karet</i>.

### Part 12
It was related that <b>Rav Huna died suddenly,</b> and <b>the Sages were concerned</b> that this was a bad sign. The Sage <b>Zuga from Hadayeiv taught them</b> the following: <b>They taught</b> these principles <b>only when</b> the deceased <b>had not reached</b> the age of <b>strength,</b> i.e., eighty. <b>But if he had reached</b> the age of <b>strength</b> and then died suddenly, <b>this is death by way of a</b> divine <b>kiss.</b>

### Part 13
<b>Rava said:</b> Length of <b>life, children, and sustenance do not depend on</b> one’s <b>merit, but rather they depend upon fate. As, Rabba and Rav Ḥisda were both pious Sages;</b> one <b>Sage</b> would <b>pray</b> during a drought <b>and rain would fall, and</b> the other <b>Sage</b> would <b>pray and rain would fall.</b>

### Part 14
And nevertheless, their lives were very different. <b>Rav Ḥisda lived for ninety-two years,</b> whereas <b>Rabba lived for</b> only <b>forty</b> years. <b>The house of Rav Ḥisda</b> celebrated <b>sixty wedding feasts,</b> whereas the <b>house of Rabba</b> experienced <b>sixty calamities.</b> In other words, many fortuitous events took place in the house of Rav Ḥisda and the opposite occurred in the house of Rabba.

### Part 15
<b>In the house of Rav Ḥisda</b> there was bread from <b>the finest flour [<i>semida</i>]</b> even <b>for the dogs, and it was not asked after,</b> as there was so much food. <b>In the house of Rabba,</b> on the other hand, there was coarse <b>barley bread</b> even <b>for people, and it was not found</b> in sufficient quantities. This shows that the length of life, children, and sustenance all depend not upon one’s merit, but upon fate.

### Part 16
Apropos Rav Ḥisda’s great wealth, the Gemara reports that <b>Rava said: These three things I requested from Heaven, two</b> of which <b>were given to me,</b> and <b>one was not given to me:</b> I requested the <b>wisdom of Rav Huna and the wealth of Rav Ḥisda and they were given to me.</b> I also requested the <b>humility of Rabba bar Rav Huna,</b> but <b>it was not given to me.</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara continues its discussion of the deaths of the righteous. <b>Rav Seorim, Rava’s brother, sat before Rava,</b> and <b>he saw that</b> Rava <b>was dozing,</b> i.e., about to die. Rava <b>said to</b> his brother: <b>Master, tell him,</b> the Angel of Death, <b>not to torment me.</b> Knowing that Rava was not afraid of the Angel of Death, Rav Seorim <b>said to</b> him: <b>Master, are you not a friend of</b> the Angel of Death? Rava <b>said to him: Since</b> my <b>fate has been handed over</b> to him, and it has been decreed that I shall die, the Angel of Death <b>no longer pays heed to me.</b> Rav Seorim <b>said to</b> Rava: <b>Master, appear to me</b> in a dream after your death. And Rava <b>appeared to him.</b> Rav Seorim <b>said to</b> Rava: <b>Master, did you have pain</b> in death? <b>He said to him: Like the prick</b> of the knife <b>when letting blood.</b>

### Part 18
It was similarly related that <b>Rava sat before Rav Naḥman,</b> and <b>he saw that</b> Rav Naḥman <b>was dozing,</b> i.e., slipping into death. Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Rava: <b>Master, tell</b> the Angel of Death <b>not to torment me.</b> Rava <b>said to him: Master, are you not an important person</b> who is respected in Heaven? Rav Naḥman <b>said to him:</b> In the supernal world <b>who is important? Who is honorable? Who is complete?</b>

### Part 19
Rava <b>said to</b> Rav Naḥman: <b>Master, appear to me</b> in a dream after your death. And <b>he appeared to him.</b> Rava <b>said to him: Master, did you have pain</b> in death? Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: Like the removal of hair from milk,</b> which is a most gentle process. But nevertheless, <b>were the Holy One, Blessed be He, to say to me: Go</b> back <b>to that world,</b> the physical world, <b>as you were, I would not want to go, for the fear of</b> the Angel of Death <b>is great.</b> And I would not want to go through such a terrifying experience a second time.

### Part 20
The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Elazar was</b> once <b>eating <i>teruma</i>,</b> when the Angel of Death <b>appeared to him. He said to</b> the Angel of Death: <b>I am eating <i>teruma</i>; is it not called sacred?</b> It would be inappropriate for me to die now and thereby defile this sacred <i>teruma</i>. The Angel of Death accepted his argument and left him. <b>The moment passed,</b> and he lived for some time afterward.

### Part 21
It was similarly related that the Angel of Death once <b>appeared to Rav Sheshet in the marketplace.</b> Rav Sheshet <b>said to</b> the Angel of Death: Shall I die <b>in the market like an animal? Come to</b> my <b>house</b> and kill me there like a human being.

### Part 22
So too, the Angel of Death <b>appeared to Rav Ashi in the marketplace.</b> Rav Ashi <b>said to</b> the Angel of Death: <b>Give me thirty days so that I may review my studies, for you say</b> above: <b>Fortunate is he who comes here</b> to Heaven <b>with his learning in his hand. On the thirtieth day</b> the Angel of Death <b>came</b> to take him. Rav Ashi <b>said to</b> the Angel of Death: <b>What is all of this?</b> Why are you in such a hurry to take me? Why can you not postpone my death? He said to him: <b>The foot of</b> Rav Huna <b>bar Natan is pushing</b> you, as he is ready to succeed you as the leader of the generation, <b>and one sovereignty does not overlap with its counterpart, even</b> by <b>one hairbreadth.</b> Therefore, you cannot live any longer.

### Part 23
The Angel of Death <b>was unable</b> to take <b>Rav Ḥisda because his mouth was never silent from study.</b> So the Angel of Death <b>went</b> and <b>sat on the cedar</b> column that supported the roof of <b>the study hall of the Sages. The cedar cracked and</b> Rav Ḥisda <b>was silent</b> for a moment, as he was startled by the sound. At that point the Angel of Death was <b>able to</b> take <b>him.</b>

### Part 24
The Angel of Death <b>could not come near Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> owing to his righteousness. <b>One day</b> the Angel of Death <b>appeared to him as a poor person. He came and knocked on the door. He said to</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya: <b>Bring out bread for me,</b> and <b>he took out</b> bread <b>for him.</b> The Angel of Death then <b>said</b> to Rabbi Ḥiyya: <b>Master, do you not have mercy on a poor person? Why, then, do you not have mercy upon that man,</b> i.e., upon me, and give me what I want? The Angel of Death then <b>revealed</b> his identity <b>to him,</b> and <b>showed him a fiery rod</b> in order to confirm that he was the Angel of Death. At this point Rav Ḥiyya <b>surrendered</b> himself <b>to him.</b>
