### Part 1
<b>and seven</b> people <b>read</b> from the Torah. <b>And</b> then <b>they leave</b> and pray on their own. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa says:</b> It is <b>not that they stroll</b> afterward <b>in the marketplace,</b> but <b>rather they sit</b> at home <b>in silent</b> mourning.

### Part 2
<b>And</b> furthermore, <b>one may not speak</b> about <b><i>halakha</i> or <i>aggada</i> in a house of mourning,</b> as this is an activity that brings people joy. <b>It was said of Rabbi Ḥananya ben Gamliel that he would speak about <i>halakha</i> and <i>aggada</i> in a house of mourning.</b>

### Part 3
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: During the <b>first week</b> after his bereavement, <b>the mourner may not go out of the opening of his house.</b> During the <b>second</b> week, <b>he may go out, but he may not sit in his</b> usual <b>place</b> in the synagogue. During the <b>third</b> week, <b>he may sit in his</b> usual <b>place but he may not speak.</b> During the <b>fourth</b> week, <b>he is like any</b> other <b>person.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: They did not need to say</b> that <b>during the first week</b> the mourner <b>may not go out of the opening of his house.</b> This teaches us nothing new, <b>as</b> at that time <b>everyone goes into his house to console him. Rather,</b> during the <b>second</b> week, he may <b>not go out of the opening of his house.</b> During the <b>third</b> week, <b>he may go out, but he may not sit in his</b> usual <b>place</b> in the synagogue. During the <b>fourth</b> week, <b>he may sit in his</b> usual <b>place, but he may not speak.</b> During the <b>fifth</b> week, <b>he is like any</b> other <b>person.</b>

### Part 5
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> another <i>baraita</i>: During <b>the entire thirty-day</b> period of mourning, it is prohibited <b>to marry.</b> If <b>one’s wife died, it is prohibited to marry another wife until three Festivals pass</b> since her death. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> Until the <b>first and second</b> Festivals have passed, <b>he is prohibited</b> from marrying; before the <b>third</b> Festival, however, he is <b>permitted</b> to do so.

### Part 6
<b>And if he does not have children, he is permitted to marry</b> another wife <b>immediately due to</b> the need to not <b>neglect</b> the mitzva to <b>be fruitful and multiply.</b> Since he has not yet fulfilled the mitzva of procreation, he is still required to marry a wife. Any delay might result in a lost opportunity for marriage. Similarly, if his wife died and <b>left him young children, he is permitted to marry</b> another wife <b>immediately, so that</b> she might <b>take care of them.</b>

### Part 7
There was <b>an incident when the wife of Yosef the Priest died, and he said to her sister at the cemetery</b> immediately after the funeral: <b>Go and care for your sister’s children.</b> In other words, he alluded that he wished to marry her immediately. <b>But even though</b> he married her immediately, <b>he did not engage in sexual relations with her for a long time</b> afterward. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the term: <b>A long time? Rav Pappa said: After thirty days.</b>

### Part 8
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> yet another <i>baraita</i>: During <b>the entire thirty-day</b> period of mourning, it is prohibited <b>to</b> wear <b>ironed</b> garments, <b>whether they are new garments or old garments taken out of the press,</b> as ironed garments appear to be new. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi disagrees and <b>says:</b> The Sages <b>prohibited</b> wearing <b>only new garments. Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: They prohibited</b> wearing <b>only new white garments.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara relates that <b>Abaye went out</b> while he was in mourning <b>in an old white garment, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Rava,</b> on the other hand, <b>went out in a new, red Roman cloak,</b> as he acted <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon.</b>

### Part 10
It was taught in the mishna: This is <b>because</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that <b>Shabbat counts</b> as one of the days of mourning, <b>but it does not interrupt</b> the mourning period, which continues after Shabbat. It is stated that with regard to mourning on Shabbat, there is a difference in practice between <b>the residents of Judea and the residents of the Galilee. These say:</b>
