### Part 1
<b>When they reached a bridge</b> that could be crossed only in single file, <b>the camels</b> carrying the two Sages <b>stood</b> in their places and would not cross the bridge. <b>A certain Arab</b> [<b><i>Tayya’a</i></b>] who witnessed what was happening <b>said to them: What is this</b> phenomenon that the camels have stopped moving? <b>They said to him: The</b> deceased <b>Sages are showing honor to each other.</b> It is as if one <b>Sage is saying: The Master should go</b> and cross the bridge <b>first,</b> while at the same time the other <b>Sage is saying: The Master should go</b> and cross <b>first.</b> The Arab <b>said: By law Rabba bar Huna should go first,</b> since he is the son of a great man, and <b>the camel</b> carrying <b>Rabba bar Huna</b> then <b>passed</b> first. Shortly thereafter, <b>the molars and</b> other <b>teeth of that Arab fell out</b> due to the disrespect he showed Rav Hamnuna.

### Part 2
When they reached Tiberias <b>a certain child opened</b> his eulogy saying as follows: <b>The shoot of an ancient line,</b> i.e., Rabba bar Rav Huna, who was the descendant of great people, <b>has ascended from Babylonia, and with him is the book of wars,</b> i.e., Rav Hamnuna, who was great in Torah, which is referred to as the book of the Wars of the Lord (Numbers 21:14). <b>The</b> curses of the <b>pelican and the bittern,</b> which are symbols of the destruction of the Temple (Isaiah 34:11), <b>have been doubled, to see the ruin and brokenness that has come from Shinar,</b> i.e., Babylonia. The Lord <b>became angry with His world and seized souls from it, and He rejoices over them</b> when they come to Him <b>like a new bride.</b> God <b>who rides upon the clouds is joyous and happy when an innocent and righteous soul comes to Him.</b>

### Part 3
§ The Gemara continues recounting other famous eulogies. <b>When Ravina passed away, a certain eulogizer opened</b> his eulogy <b>for him</b> with the following words: <b>Date-palms, hang your heads</b> in sadness <b>over the righteous man who may be likened to a date-palm. Women,</b> make your <b>nights like days</b> in weeping, <b>over</b> a man who <b>made</b> his <b>nights like days</b> studying the Torah.

### Part 4
The Gemara relates that prior to Ravina’s death, <b>Rav Ashi said to bar Kippok,</b> who was a famous eulogizer: <b>On that day</b> when Ravina will die, <b>what will you say? He said to him: I shall</b> begin my eulogy and <b>say</b> as follows: <b>If the cedars went up in flame, what shall the hyssop of the wall do? If the leviathan was lifted by a hook, what shall the</b> tiny <b>fish of the marsh do? If dryness overtook a flowing river, what can the water of the puddles do?</b>

### Part 5
<b>Bar Avin,</b> who was also a eulogizer, <b>said to him: God forbid</b> that the words <b>hook and flame</b> should be <b>said with regard to the righteous,</b> as these are not expressions of honor. Rav Ashi asked him: <b>And what will you say?</b> He said to him: <b>I shall say: Cry for the mourners and not for that which was lost, as</b> that which was lost, i.e., the soul of Ravina, has gone <b>to</b> its eternal <b>rest, while we,</b> the mourners, are left with our <b>sighs.</b>

### Part 6
Rav Ashi <b>was offended by them,</b> as their words of praise for Ravina might have been understood as a show of disrespect to Rav Ashi, since they likened Ravina to a cedar and the other Sages, Rav Ashi included, to hyssops of the wall. Due to Rav Ashi’s anger, <b>their feet turned</b> inward and became crooked. <b>On that day</b> when Ravina actually died, <b>neither</b> of them <b>came to eulogize him. This is</b> what <b>Rav Ashi said</b> using a metaphor to describe this incident: <b>Neither bar Kippok can perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, nor can bar Avin perform <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> because their feet are crooked and so their shoes cannot be removed from their feet in the proper manner.

### Part 7
<b>When Rava</b> once <b>came to the Tigris</b> River, and he was concerned that he might be swept away by the water, <b>he said to bar Avin: Rise</b> and <b>say</b> a prayer on our behalf. <b>He rose and said: Most of the third,</b> a poetic reference to the Jewish people (Isaiah 19:24), <b>has come in the water,</b> implying that Rava was equal in importance to the majority of the Jewish people. <b>Remember</b> then <b>and have mercy</b> on us. Although <b>we have strayed from you like an</b> unfaithful <b>woman</b> strays <b>from her husband, do not forsake</b> and punish <b>us like the sign of the bitter water,</b> with which a woman suspected of adultery is tested. That is to say, do not punish us with water.

### Part 8
Apropos eulogies for righteous men, the Gemara presents the names: <b>Ḥanin, Yoḥanan, Zeira, Abba, Ya’akov, Yosei, Shmuel, Ḥiyya,</b> and <b>Menaḥem;</b> this is a <b>mnemonic device</b> for the stories that follow.

### Part 9
It was related that <b>Rabbi Ḥanin was a son-in-law in the house of the <i>Nasi</i>.</b> At first <b>he did not have</b> any <b>children,</b> but <b>he prayed</b> that God have <b>mercy</b> on him, <b>and</b> then <b>had</b> a child. <b>On the</b> same <b>day that</b> a son <b>was</b> born <b>to him, he</b> himself <b>passed away. A certain eulogizer opened</b> his eulogy <b>for him</b> with the following words: <b>Happiness has been turned into sorrow; joy and suffering have become joined together. At the moment of his happiness he sighed</b> his dying breath. <b>At the moment he was graced</b> with a son, <b>his</b> own <b>grace was lost. And they named</b> the child <b>Ḥanan after</b> his father.

### Part 10
<b>When Rabbi Yoḥanan passed away, Rabbi Yitzḥak ben Elazar opened</b> his eulogy <b>for him</b> as follows: <b>Today is as difficult for the Jewish people as the day that the sun set at noon, as it is written: “And it shall come to pass on that day,</b> says the Lord God, <b>that I will cause the sun to go down at noon,</b> and I will darken the earth in the clear day. And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; and I will bring up sackcloth upon all loins, and baldness upon every head; and I will make it as the mourning for an only son, and its end like a bitter day” (Amos 8:9–10). <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This was the day</b> on which King <b>Josiah</b> was killed (see II Chronicles 35:20–24). This demonstrates that the most righteous person of the generation is described as the sun.

### Part 11
It was further related that <b>when Rabbi Yoḥanan passed away, Rabbi Ami sat</b> in mourning for him for <b>seven</b> days <b>and</b> for <b>thirty</b> days as though he had lost a close relative. <b>Rabbi Abba, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, said:</b> What <b>Rabbi Ami did, he did on his own,</b> but this practice does not reflect the <i>halakha</i>. <b>For Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said as follows: Even</b> for the death of <b>his teacher who taught him wisdom, one sits</b> in mourning <b>over him for only one day</b> and no more.

### Part 12
The Gemara tells of another incident about a eulogy: <b>When Rabbi Zeira died, a certain eulogizer opened</b> his eulogy <b>for him</b> saying: <b>The land of Shinar conceived and gave birth</b> to him, as he was originally Babylonian, but <b>the land of beauty,</b> i.e., Eretz Yisrael, <b>raised the darling</b> of Babylonia, as he later moved to Eretz Yisrael and grew up there. <b>Woe to her, said Rakkath,</b> a poetic name for Tiberias, <b>for her dearest vessel has been lost.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara continues to discuss the death of the righteous: <b>When Rabbi Abbahu passed away, the pillars of Caesarea,</b> his city, <b>ran with water</b> as if they were shedding tears over him. When <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> passed away, <b>the gutters of Tzippori,</b> his city, <b>flowed with blood.</b> When <b>Rabbi Ya’akov</b> passed away, <b>the stars were visible during the day.</b> When <b>Rabbi Asi</b> passed away, <b>all the trees were uprooted</b> in a storm. When <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> passed away, <b>fiery stones fell from the sky.</b> When <b>Rabbi Menaḥem, son of Rabbi Yosei,</b> passed away, the faces of <b>the statues became smooth as if they had been smoothed with</b> a plasterer’s <b>trowel</b> [<b><i>meḥlatzaya</i></b>].

### Part 14
When <b>Rabbi Tanḥum bar Ḥiyya</b> passed away, <b>every statue [<i>andartaya</i>]</b> of the king <b>were mutilated.</b> When <b>Rabbi Elyashiv</b> passed away, <b>seventy tunnels</b> of thieves <b>were dug in Neharde’a,</b> because as long as he was alive there were no thieves in the town due to his merit. When <b>Rav Hamnuna</b> passed away, <b>hail stones fell from the sky.</b> When <b>Rabba and Rav Yosef</b> passed away, the tops of <b>the bridges of the Euphrates</b> collapsed and <b>touched each other.</b> When <b>Abaye and Rava</b> passed away, the tops of <b>the bridges of the Tigris</b> collapsed and <b>touched each other.</b> When <b>Rabbi Mesharshiyya</b> passed away, <b>the palm trees</b> became <b>laden</b> with <b>thorns [<i>shitzei</i>].</b>

### Part 15
§ The Gemara returns to the subject of tearing garments in mourning: <b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>:
