### Part 1
The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps the ritual impurity was on the inside and the trees were on the outside,</b> and only the area between the trees was plowed, while the inner portion of the field with the grave was not plowed?

### Part 2
The Gemara answers: The case is where the trees are <b>scattered</b> throughout the entire field, so that it is likely that the entire field was plowed. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: This is not a concern, as <b>we said</b> earlier that <b>one does not distance the marker</b> too far <b>from the</b> actual <b>site of ritual impurity, so as not to cause a loss of Eretz Yisrael.</b> As the marker is located near the trees, presumably the trees are close to the actual site of the grave, and the site of the grave was plowed.

### Part 3
It is taught in the <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> One relies on these signs <b>only</b> when <b>there is an Elder or</b> a rabbinic <b>scholar</b> who can testify about the matter, <b>as not all are well versed in this matter,</b> and perhaps the field was not plowed at all. <b>Abaye said: Learn from this</b> statement of Rabbi Yehuda that when <b>there is a Torah scholar in the city, all affairs of the city are thrust upon him,</b> i.e., are his responsibility. Consequently, he is expected to know what has happened in the city.

### Part 4
§ The Gemara continues its discussion of marking graves. <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> If <b>one found</b> a single <b>marked stone,</b> this indicates that the ground <b>underneath it is ritually impure.</b> If he found <b>two</b> marked stones, the following distinction applies: <b>If there is lime</b> on the ground <b>between them,</b> this indicates that the area <b>between them is ritually impure</b> and the two stones mark the boundaries of the impure area; <b>and if there is no lime</b> on the ground <b>between them,</b> this indicates that the area <b>between them is ritually pure</b> and each stone marks a separate area of ritual impurity.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is the area between them deemed ritually pure <b>even though there is no</b> sign of <b>plowing</b> having taken place between the stones? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> otherwise in a <i>baraita</i> as follows: <b>If one found a single marked stone,</b> this indicates that the ground <b>underneath it is ritually impure.</b> If he found <b>two</b> marked stones, then the following distinction applies: <b>If there is</b> evidence of <b>plowing</b> having taken place <b>between them,</b> the area <b>between</b> the two stones <b>is ritually pure; and if not,</b> the area <b>between them is ritually impure.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> The contradiction can be resolved by explaining that <b>here,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, the case is <b>where the lime</b> used as a marker of ritual impurity <b>had been poured on top</b> of the stones, <b>and it is spread thinly this way and that.</b> In this case, <b>if there is</b> evidence of <b>plowing</b> having taken place <b>between</b> the stones, the area <b>between them is ritually pure, as one</b> can <b>say</b> that the lime <b>was peeled off</b> from the stones <b>due to the plowing;</b> originally the lime was only on top of the stones, to indicate that there is ritual impurity underneath them, but then fell into the area between them during the plowing. <b>But if</b> there is <b>no</b> evidence of a plow having passed between them, then it is most likely that <b>the lime was</b> meant to mark the ground <b>between</b> the stones, and the entire area between them <b>is ritually impure.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Asi said:</b> If only <b>one border</b> of a field <b>is marked,</b> it is assumed that the border itself <b>is ritually impure while the entire</b> rest of the <b>field is ritually pure.</b> If <b>two</b> borders are marked, it is assumed that <b>they are</b> both <b>ritually impure while the entire</b> rest of the <b>field is ritually pure.</b> If <b>three</b> borders are marked, it is assumed that the three of <b>them are ritually impure while the entire</b> rest of the <b>field is ritually pure.</b> If all <b>four</b> borders are marked, the borders themselves <b>are ritually pure, while the entire field</b> enclosed by the borders <b>is ritually impure.</b>

### Part 8
<b>As the Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>One does not distance the marker from the</b> actual <b>site of ritual impurity, so as not to cause a loss of Eretz Yisrael,</b> i.e., not to increase the area into which people refrain from entering. Consequently, they marked all of the borders to indicate that the entire field is ritually impure.

### Part 9
§ It is taught in the mishna: <b>And</b> inspectors <b>even go out</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival <b>to</b> uproot <b>the</b> shoots of prohibited <b>diverse kinds [<i>kilayim</i>]</b> that grew in the fields during the rainy season.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>Do they go out to</b> uproot <b>diverse kinds during the intermediate days of a Festival?</b> The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from another mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 1:1), which states: <b>On the first of Adar</b> the court <b>issues a proclamation concerning</b> the collection of <b>the shekels,</b> i.e., the yearly half-shekel contribution to the Temple treasury made by each adult male for the purpose of buying communal offerings. <b>And</b> the court also issues a proclamation <b>with regard to</b> the obligation to uproot <b>diverse kinds</b> from the fields.

### Part 11
<b>On the fifteenth of</b> Adar <b>the Megilla,</b> the Scroll of Esther, <b>is read in the</b> walled <b>cities, and they go out to clear thorns</b> from the <b>roads, to repair the</b> city <b>streets, and to measure the ritual baths</b> to ascertain that they have the requisite quantity of water. <b>And they tend to all</b> other <b>public needs, and they mark graves</b> with lime, <b>and they go out to</b> uproot <b>the</b> shoots of <b>diverse kinds.</b> If they already went out in Adar to uproot the diverse kinds, why would they go out again on the intermediate days of the festival of Passover?

### Part 12
<b>Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina</b> disagreed about this issue: <b>One said: Here,</b> in the mishna that states that they go out on the fifteenth of Adar, it is referring to <b>the early crop,</b> while <b>there,</b> in the mishna that states that they go out on the intermediate days of the Festival, it is referring to <b>the late crop,</b> which isn’t clearly recognizable until the intermediate days of Passover. <b>And one said: Here,</b> in the mishna that states that they go out on the fifteenth of Adar, it is referring to <b>grains</b> that are sown in the winter and have already grown tall by Adar, while <b>there,</b> in the mishna that states that they go out on the intermediate days of the Festival, it is referring to <b>vegetables,</b> which only grow later in the season.

### Part 13
<b>Rabbi Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: They taught</b> that court messengers go out to uproot diverse kinds in the middle of the month of Adar <b>only</b> in a case <b>where the blossom was not</b> yet <b>recognizable</b> at an earlier date, so it was still impossible to determine whether or not the seedling was from diverse kinds of seeds. <b>But</b> if <b>the blossom was</b> already <b>recognizable</b> at an earlier date, <b>they go out</b> at that time to uproot the shoots of diverse kinds of seeds.

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different about the intermediate days of a Festival that we</b> specifically <b>go out</b> to uproot shoots of diverse kinds of seeds during that week? <b>Rabbi Ya’akov said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It is <b>due to the wages</b> paid to the workers hired by the court to uproot the diverse kinds. On the intermediate days of the Festival it is prohibited for them to perform ordinary labor, and so <b>they reduce</b> their rates <b>for us,</b> i.e., for public works, as otherwise they would have no income at all.

### Part 15
<b>Rav Zevid said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rav Mesharshiyya</b> who <b>said: Learn from this</b> explanation <b>that when we give</b> the workers who uproot the diverse kinds their <b>wages, we give</b> it <b>to them from</b> the funds of <b>the collection of the</b> Temple treasury <b>chamber.</b> Since they are paid with consecrated money, an attempt is made to minimize the expenses. <b>As, if it enters your mind</b> that <b>we pay them from theirs,</b> i.e., the court forces the owners of the fields where the diverse kinds are found to pay the workers who uproot them, <b>what</b> benefit <b>would we derive from</b> saving the expense? <b>However much</b> the workers <b>desire, they should pay them.</b>

### Part 16
Concerning the issue of uprooting diverse kinds, the Gemara asks: <b>And how much</b> of another species must be mixed in with a crop in order to be considered diverse kinds that must be uprooted by these workers? <b>Rav Shmuel bar Yitzḥak said:</b> The amount is <b>like that which we learned</b> in the mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 2:1): <b>Any <i>se’a</i></b> of seeds <b>that contains</b>
