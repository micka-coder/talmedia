### Part 1
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that only the relatives of the deceased rend their clothes. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is this the case <b>even</b> if the deceased was a Torah <b>Sage? But isn’t it taught</b> otherwise in a <i>baraita</i>: When a Torah <b>scholar dies, everyone is his relative.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara clarifies: <b>Does it enter your mind</b> to say that <b>everyone is his relative? Rather,</b> this <i>baraita</i> should be understood as follows: <b>Everyone is</b> considered to be <b>like his relative</b> in the sense that <b>everyone rends his</b> garment in anguish <b>over him, and everyone bares</b> his shoulder <b>over him</b> in mourning, <b>and everyone eats the mourner’s meal over him in the public square</b> as mourners do. The death of a Torah scholar is a personal loss for every Jew. So why is the mishna limited to only relatives? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for the mishna to teach this <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where</b> the deceased <b>is not a</b> Torah <b>scholar.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>And if</b> the deceased <b>was an upright person</b> who feared Heaven and performed good deeds, then aren’t all those present at his death <b>obligated to rend</b> their garments over his death? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>For what</b> reason <b>do a person’s sons and daughters die when they are young?</b> They die <b>so that he will cry and mourn</b> over the death of <b>an upright person.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara questions the formulation: They die so that <b>he will cry and mourn? Is security,</b> i.e., his children, <b>taken from him</b> in advance to ensure that in the future he will mourn over the death of an upright person? <b>Rather</b> the <i>baraita</i> means as follows: His children died <b>because he did not cry or mourn over an upright person</b> who died. <b>As</b> with regard to <b>anyone who cries and mourns over an upright person</b> who died, <b>they forgive him</b> for <b>all his transgressions because of the honor he accorded</b> to the deceased. If this is the case, one also rends his clothes over an upright person. The Gemara answers: Rather, the mishna is referring only to one <b>who</b> was <b>not an upright person.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara challenges: But <b>if one was standing there at the time of the soul’s departure,</b> i.e., at the time of death, he <b>is</b> also <b>obligated</b> to rend his clothes. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: One who stands over the deceased at the time of the soul’s departure is obligated to rend</b> his clothes. <b>To what may this be likened? To a Torah scroll that is burned,</b> for which anyone present <b>is obligated to rend</b> his clothes.

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: The mishna must be referring to a person <b>who was not standing there at the time of the soul’s departure</b> but who heard that someone who is not a close relative died, and the deceased was neither a Torah scholar nor an upright person.

### Part 7
§ The Gemara relates that <b>when Rav Safra passed away the</b> other <b>Sages did not rend</b> their garments <b>over him. They said: We did not learn from him,</b> as he did not disseminate his Torah knowledge to the public. <b>Abaye</b> berated them and <b>said to them: Is it taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: If one’s <b>teacher died? It is taught:</b> If a Torah <b>scholar died,</b> and Rav Safra was certainly a Torah scholar. <b>And furthermore, every day his teachings are in our mouths in the study hall,</b> so that even if we did not learn directly from him, we should still be considered his students.

### Part 8
The other Sages <b>thought that what was</b> done <b>was</b> done, and it was now too late for them to rend their garments. <b>Abaye said to them: We learned:</b> With regard to a Torah <b>scholar, as long as they are engaged in eulogizing</b> him, then people <b>are obligated to rend</b> their garments, even after the time of his death. <b>They</b> then <b>thought to rend</b> their garments <b>immediately. Abaye said to them: It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A</b> Torah <b>scholar’s honor is at</b> the time of <b>his eulogy,</b> and so you should wait until the time of the eulogy before rending your garments.

### Part 9
§ The Gemara relates another incident: <b>When Rav Huna died they thought to place a Torah scroll on his bier,</b> as was commonly done after the death of a Torah scholar, as if to say that the deceased fulfilled everything written in the scroll. <b>Rav Ḥisda said to them:</b> This is <b>a practice that he did not hold with during his lifetime; now should we stand up and do</b> it <b>for him</b> when he is dead? <b>As Rav Taḥlifa said: I</b> myself <b>saw Rav Huna, who wished to sit on his bed, and there was a Torah scroll placed on it. And he turned a jug over and placed the Torah scroll on it</b> so that he could then sit on the bed. <b>Apparently he holds</b> that <b>it is prohibited to sit on a bed upon which a Torah scroll lies.</b> Therefore, it would be inappropriate to lay a Torah scroll next to his body after he died.

### Part 10
When they tried to remove his corpse from his house for the burial, <b>the bier would not</b> fit <b>through the</b> narrow <b>door. They</b> then <b>thought to lower</b> the bier <b>from the roof. Rav Ḥisda said to them: This I learned from him,</b> Rav Huna himself: <b>A scholar’s honor</b> is for him to be taken out <b>through the</b> main <b>opening,</b> and not in any other manner.

### Part 11
<b>They</b> then <b>thought to move him from</b> his <b>bier to</b> a narrower <b>bier</b> so that it would fit through the door. But <b>Rav Ḥisda said to them: I learned from him,</b> Rav Huna himself, <b>as follows: A scholar’s honor is</b> for him to be taken out <b>on the first bier. As Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: From where</b> is it derived that <b>a scholar’s honor is</b> for him to be taken out <b>on the first bier? As it is stated: “And they set the Ark of God upon a new cart”</b> (II Samuel 6:3). When taking the Ark to Jerusalem, King David had it placed back on the cart upon which it had been returned by the Philistines, and a Torah scholar is considered to be similar to the Ark of the Covenant. When they saw that there was nothing else that they could do, <b>they broke the doorway and took him out</b> through it.

### Part 12
<b>Rabbi Abba opened</b> his eulogy for <b>him: Our Rabbi was worthy that the Divine Presence should rest upon him, except</b> for the fact <b>that Babylonia caused it</b> not to rest. In other words, it was only because he lived in Babylonia and not in Eretz Yisrael that the Divine Presence did not rest upon him.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Ḥisda raised an objection</b> against this, <b>and some say</b> that it was <b>Rav Ḥanan bar Ḥisda:</b> Is it not stated: <b>“The word of the Lord came [<i>hayo haya</i>] to Ezekiel the priest, son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans”</b> (Ezekiel 1:3), thereby implying that a prophet can prophesy outside of Eretz Yisrael?

### Part 14
<b>His father tapped him with his sandal</b> on his foot, thereby hinting to him that he should be quiet. <b>He said to him: Have I not told you not to trouble everyone</b> with questions in the middle of a eulogy? The Gemara answers the question: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the doubling of the word <b>“came [<i>hayo haya</i>]”?</b> It implies <b>that it had already come</b> before, i.e., that Ezekiel had already begun to prophesy in Eretz Yisrael, and his prophecy in Babylonia was merely a continuation of that prophecy.

### Part 15
§ The Gemara relates that <b>when they took</b> Rav Huna <b>there,</b> to Eretz Yisrael, for burial <b>they said to Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi: Rav Huna has come,</b> and they misunderstood and thought that he was still alive. <b>They said: When we were there,</b> in Babylonia, we <b>did not have strength to lift our heads before him. Now</b> that <b>we have come here, has he come after us?</b>

### Part 16
<b>They said to them: His coffin has come. Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi went out</b> to meet his funeral procession. <b>Rabbi Ila and Rabbi Ḥanina did not go out. Some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Ila went out,</b> but <b>Rabbi Ḥanina did not go out.</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: Those who <b>went out, what is</b> the <b>reason</b> that they went? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When <b>a coffin is passing from place to place,</b> the people <b>stand in a line</b> to show respect <b>for</b> the deceased, <b>and they recite the mourners’ blessing and the consolation of the mourners over it.</b> Those <b>who did not go out, what is the reason</b> that they did not? <b>As it is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: When a <b>coffin is passing from place to place, they do not stand in a line</b> to show respect <b>for</b> the deceased, <b>and they do not recite the mourners’ blessing or</b> the <b>consolation of the mourners for him.</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>these</b> two tannaitic statements <b>contradict each other.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It is not difficult: Here,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where the skeleton</b> of the deceased <b>is</b> still <b>intact,</b> and the mourning practices must be observed. <b>And there</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where the skeleton</b> of the deceased <b>is no longer intact,</b> and it is not necessary to observe the customs of mourning. <b>And Rav Huna’s skeleton was</b> still <b>intact.</b> The reason that the <b>one</b> Sage <b>did not go out</b> was that <b>they did not confirm for him</b> that the skeleton was still intact.

### Part 19
The Sages of Eretz Yisrael <b>said: Where shall we bury him?</b> They concluded: <b>Rav Huna disseminated Torah to</b> the people of <b>Israel, and</b> similarly <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya disseminated Torah to</b> the people of <b>Israel;</b> therefore, it is appropriate to bury Rav Huna next to Rabbi Ḥiyya.

### Part 20
They asked: <b>Who will take him in</b> to Rabbi Ḥiyya’s burial cave, as few are fit to enter it? <b>Rav Ḥagga said to them: I will take him into</b> the cave, <b>for I presented my studies</b> before him <b>when I was</b> just <b>eighteen, never having experiencing a seminal emission. And</b> so too <b>I attended to him and knew his</b> great <b>deeds.</b> For example, <b>one day one of the straps of his phylacteries turned around,</b> the unpainted side being turned outward, <b>and he observed forty fasts for this,</b> as he had acted negligently, allowing the black side to face inward.

### Part 21
Rav Ḥagga <b>took him in.</b> The body of Rabbi Ḥiyya’s son <b>Yehuda lay</b> buried <b>to the right of his father, and</b> the body of his other son <b>Ḥizkiyya</b> lay <b>to his left.</b> The spirit of <b>Yehuda said to</b> the spirit of <b>Ḥizkiyya: Rise from your place, as</b> it is <b>not proper conduct</b> to remain lying when the body of <b>Rav Huna is standing here. When</b> Ḥizkiyya’s corpse stood <b>up, a pillar of fire rose with him.</b> When <b>Rabbi Ḥagga saw this, he was frightened</b> by what he saw, and so <b>he stood up</b> Rav Huna’s <b>coffin and went away.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>And he was not punished</b> or harmed by this pillar of fire <b>because he set up Rav Huna’s coffin</b> as protection for himself.

### Part 22
§ The Gemara relates another story about the burial of one of the Sages: <b>When Rav Ḥisda died they thought to place a Torah scroll on his bier. Rabbi Yitzḥak said to them:</b> This is <b>a practice that this Rabbi did not hold with during his lifetime; should we stand up and do</b> it <b>for him</b> now that he is dead?

### Part 23
<b>They</b> then <b>thought not to tack,</b> i.e., sew up, <b>the tears</b> that they had made in their clothes. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Ami said to them:</b> When the deceased is <b>a Torah Sage, they may tack</b> the tears <b>once they turn their faces from the bier.</b>

### Part 24
The Gemara relates that <b>when Rabba bar Huna and Rav Hamnuna died, they took them</b> both <b>up there,</b> to Eretz Yisrael.
