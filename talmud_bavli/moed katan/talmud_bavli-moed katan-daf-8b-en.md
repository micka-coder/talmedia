### Part 1
It is <b>because the dead is not forgotten from the heart</b> and put out of mind <b>for thirty days,</b> and therefore, when one laments the loss of a deceased relative within thirty days before a Festival, the pain is still remembered on the Festival. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between</b> the two reasons? The practical difference <b>between them</b> is in a case <b>where</b> the eulogizer <b>performs</b> the eulogy <b>free</b> of charge. In that case there is no worry that money that had been set aside for the Festival will be spent, but there is still room for concern about the lingering pain that will be felt on the Festival.

### Part 2
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may not dig crypts or graves on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival</b> in preparation for those who are still alive, <b>but one may adjust</b> previously dug <b>crypts on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival</b> in order to receive a particular corpse. <b>And one may</b> also <b>construct</b> a laundry <b>pond on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival</b> as it does not involve excessive effort. <b>And</b> one may also prepare <b>a coffin</b> if he is together <b>with the corpse in the</b> same <b>courtyard,</b> as in that case everyone knows that he is preparing the coffin for the deceased. <b>Rabbi Yehuda prohibits</b> making the coffin <b>unless</b> one <b>has</b> wooden <b>boards with him</b> that had already been cut before the Festival and that need only to be attached.

### Part 3
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What are crypts and what are graves,</b> and what is the difference between them? <b>Rav Yehuda said: Crypts</b> are constructed <b>by digging and graves</b> are constructed <b>by building.</b> The Gemara adds: <b>That is also taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>These are crypts and these are graves: Crypts</b> are constructed <b>by digging and graves</b> are constructed <b>by building.</b>

### Part 4
It is taught in the mishna: <b>But one may adjust</b> previously dug <b>crypts</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival. The Gemara asks: <b>How does one adjust</b> a crypt? <b>Rav Yehuda said: If</b> the crypt <b>was long</b>er than the corpse, <b>he shortens it.</b> With regard to this issue it <b>was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: He lengthens</b> the crypt <b>and widens it</b> to make it the right size for the particular corpse.

### Part 5
It was further taught in the mishna: <b>And one may</b> also <b>construct a</b> laundry <b>pond</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival. The Gemara asks: <b>What is a</b> laundry <b>pond? Rav Yehuda said: This is a ditch</b> dug in the ground for washing clothes. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A</b> laundry <b>pond and a</b> laundry <b>ditch,</b> which indicates that they are different from one another? <b>Abaye said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rav Kahana</b> who said: <b>A pond and a small pond,</b> i.e., the only difference between them is their size; a laundry pond is larger than a laundry ditch.

### Part 6
It was taught in the mishna: <b>And</b> one may also prepare <b>a coffin</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival if he is together <b>with the corpse in the</b> same <b>courtyard.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>We</b> already <b>learned this, as the Sages taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may tend to all the needs of the deceased</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival: <b>One may cut</b> the deceased’s <b>hair for him</b> if it was too long, <b>and one may wash his clothing,</b> i.e., his shrouds, <b>for him, and one may construct a coffin for him from boards that had</b> already <b>been cut from the eve of the Festival. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: One may even bring timber and discreetly cut it</b> into boards <b>in</b> the privacy of <b>his house.</b>

### Part 7
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may not marry a woman on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival, not virgins and not widows, and one may not perform levirate marriage</b> with his sister-in-law, if his brother died childless, <b>because it is</b> a <b>joyous</b> occasion <b>for him. However, one may remarry his divorced wife</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival, as this is not as great a joy for him.

### Part 8
<b>And a woman may engage in</b> all <b>her</b> usual <b>cosmetic treatments</b> to enhance her physical appearance <b>on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival. Rabbi Yehuda says: She may not apply lime</b> to her skin <b>because it</b> is temporarily <b>a disgrace to her,</b> as she is unattractive before the lime is peeled off and will therefore be distressed during the Festival. The mishna continues: <b>A layman,</b> who is not a skilled tailor, <b>may sew in his</b> usual <b>manner</b> if necessary for the Festival, <b>whereas a craftsman may form</b> only <b>temporary stitches. And one may interweave</b> the cords attached to the frames of <b>beds</b> upon which a mattress is placed. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: One may</b> only <b>tighten</b> the cords but not interweave them.

### Part 9
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> It was taught in the mishna that one may not marry a woman on the intermediate days of a Festival, because it is a source of joy for him. The Gemara asks: <b>And if it is a</b> source of <b>joy for him, what of it?</b> Isn’t there is a mitzva to rejoice on a Festival? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said, and, so too, Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya said, and some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said:</b> The reason that one may not get married on the intermediate days of a Festival is <b>because one may not mix</b> one <b>joy with</b> another <b>joy,</b> as each requires its own celebration. <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna said:</b> The reason is <b>because he forsakes the rejoicing of the pilgrimage Festival and occupies</b> himself <b>with rejoicing</b> with <b>his wife.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: This</b> statement <b>of Rabba bar Rav Huna is</b> actually a statement <b>of Rav, as Rav Daniel bar Ketina said that Rav said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one may not marry a woman on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival? As it is stated: “And you shall rejoice in your Festival”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:14). This verse emphasizes that you must rejoice <b>in your Festival and not in your wife.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Ulla said:</b> The reason one may not marry on the intermediate days of a Festival is <b>due to the</b> excessive <b>exertion</b> that the wedding preparations demand, which is prohibited during the Festival. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa said:</b> The reason is <b>due to the neglect of</b> the mitzva to be <b>fruitful and multiply.</b> If it were permissible to get married during the intermediate days of a Festival, people would delay getting married until then in order to save money by avoiding the necessity of preparing separate feasts for the Festival and for the wedding. In the meantime they would neglect the mitzva of procreation.

### Part 12
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>All those whom</b> the Sages <b>said are prohibited to marry on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival</b>
