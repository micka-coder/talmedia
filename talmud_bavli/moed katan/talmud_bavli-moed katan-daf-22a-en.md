### Part 1
If <b>the principal</b> member <b>of the household went</b> with the remains of the deceased <b>to the cemetery</b> and did not return for several days, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If another mourner came to the house of mourning during his absence, does he follow the principal member of the household and count from the time of the burial, or does he count from the time that the funeral procession departed, like the other members of the household?

### Part 2
The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear that which Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Even</b> if the <b>principal</b> member <b>of the household went to the cemetery,</b> the mourner who comes home during his absence <b>counts with them,</b> i.e., the other members of the household who did not go to the cemetery. The Gemara asks: Does <b>he</b> really <b>count</b> and complete his mourning <b>with them? But isn’t it taught</b> otherwise in a <i>baraita</i>, that <b>he counts</b> seven days <b>on his own?</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: <b>This is not difficult. This</b> statement, that he counts with them, is referring to a case <b>where</b> the principal member of the household <b>came</b> home <b>within three</b> days. <b>And the other</b> ruling, that he counts on his own, is referring to a case <b>where he did not come</b> home <b>within three</b> days. This conclusion is <b>similar to</b> what <b>Rav said to the sons of Hatzleponi</b> when they were in mourning: <b>Those who come</b> home <b>within three</b> days <b>should count with you;</b> whereas <b>those who do not come</b> home <b>within three</b> days <b>should count on their own.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rava said to the people of Meḥoza:</b> Those of <b>you who do not follow the coffin</b> all the way to the place of interment <b>should begin counting</b> your days of mourning <b>from when you turn your faces from the city gates</b> to return home. Since the dead were commonly transported long distances and buried far away, most of the mourners did not accompany their deceased relatives to the actual site of burial.

### Part 5
§ The Gemara cites the <i>baraita</i> taught above: <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Even</b> if one of the mourners <b>came on the seventh day from a nearby place, he counts with</b> the other mourners and completes the seven-day period of mourning with them. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Gamda said that Rabbi Yosei ben Shaul said that Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: And this is</b> the <i>halakha</i>, provided that <b>he came and found consolers</b> still present <b>in the house.</b>

### Part 6
§ <b>Rav Anan asks:</b> If the consolers <b>had</b> already <b>stirred</b> themselves <b>to stand up</b> and leave but <b>did not</b> yet actually <b>stand up</b> and leave, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is it considered as if the consolers have already left or not? This question was not answered, and the dilemma <b>stands</b> unresolved.

### Part 7
The Gemara relates that <b>a colleague of Rabbi Abba bar Ḥiyya learned</b> the following principle as a tradition <b>from Rabbi Abba.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And who was</b> this colleague? It was <b>Rabbi Zeira. And some say</b> a different version of this tradition: <b>A colleague of Rabbi Zeira</b> learned a tradition <b>from Rabbi Zeira.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And who is</b> this colleague? It was <b>Rabbi Abba, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel with regard to</b> an animals that is unsuitable for human consumption because of severe organic disease or congenital defect, making it <b>a <i>tereifa</i>, and the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>mourning.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara explains: The <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon with regard to mourning, concerning that which we</b> just <b>said</b> about a mourner who arrives on the seventh day. The <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel with regard to</b> defects in animals that render them <b><i>tereifa</i></b> concerning <b>that which we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If the animal’s <b>intestines became perforated, but</b> the hole <b>was stopped up by mucus,</b> so that nothing comes out of this hole, the animal is <b>fit.</b> Unlike an ordinary hole in the intestines, this hole does not render the animal a <i>tereifa</i> and make it unfit for consumption. This is <b>the statement of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is this <b>mucus? Rav Kahana said: The fat [<i>shirka</i>] of the intestines that comes out under pressure. Someone</b> whose name was not given <b>said: May I merit to go up</b> to Eretz Yisrael <b>and learn this <i>halakha</i> from the mouth of its author.</b>

### Part 10
<b>When he went up</b> from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael, <b>he found Rabbi Abba, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba,</b> and <b>said to him: Did the Master say</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel with regard to</b> defects that render the animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i>? He said to him: I said</b> just the opposite, namely, that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is not</b> in accordance with Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, and therefore such a hole in the animal’s intestine makes it unfit for eating.

### Part 11
He asked him again: <b>What</b> about the other ruling reported in your name, that the <i>halakha</i> <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon with regard to mourning?</b> Is this accurate? <b>He said to him:</b> This issue is <b>subject to dispute, as it was stated: Rav Ḥisda said: The <i>halakha</i></b> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, <b>and similarly Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It is the <b><i>halakha</i>.</b> But <b>Rav Naḥman said: It is not the <i>halakha</i>.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara concludes: <b>The <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel with regard to</b> the aforementioned issue of <b><i>tereifa</i>, and the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with Rabbi Shimon with regard to mourning, as Shmuel stated</b> a principle: <b>The <i>halakha</i> follows the opinion of the</b> more <b>lenient</b> authority <b>in</b> matters relating to <b>mourning.</b>

### Part 13
§ It was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>With regard to all</b> other <b>deceased</b> relatives, it <b>is praiseworthy</b> for <b>one</b> to be <b>quick</b> in taking <b>the bier</b> out for burial. But <b>in</b> the case of <b>one’s father or mother,</b> acting in this manner <b>is condemnable,</b> as one should draw out the period of acute mourning for his parent. If, however, <b>it was Friday or the eve of a Festival,</b> then <b>one is praiseworthy</b> for expediting his parent’s burial because <b>he does this only out of respect for his father or mother,</b> as he does not want them to remain unburied for the duration of Shabbat or the Festival.

### Part 14
<b>With regard to all</b> other <b>dead,</b> if the mourner <b>wishes</b> he may <b>reduce his business</b> due to mourning. If, however, <b>he wishes</b> not to do so, he <b>need not</b>
