### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may irrigate a field that requires irrigation on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival as well as during the Sabbatical Year, both from a newly emerged spring</b> that began to flow only during the Festival, <b>and from a spring that did not just emerge</b> and that has been flowing for some time. <b>However, one may not irrigate</b> a field <b>with rainwater</b> collected in a cistern, a procedure that requires excessive exertion, <b>or with water drawn with a shadoof [<i>kilon</i>],</b> a lever used to raise water with a bucket from deep down in a well.

### Part 2
<b>And one may not construct circular ditches</b> around the bases of <b>grapevines</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival. <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says: One may not construct a new</b> water <b>channel during</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival or during the Sabbatical Year. And the Rabbis say: One may construct a new</b> water <b>channel during the Sabbatical Year and one may repair damaged</b> water channels <b>during</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival.</b>

### Part 3
In addition to performing labor on one’s own property in order to avoid financial loss, it is also permitted to perform labor on the intermediate days of a Festival for the public welfare: <b>One may repair damaged water</b> cisterns <b>that are in the public domain, and clean them out</b> by removing the dirt and sediment that accumulated there; <b>one may repair roads, streets, and ritual baths; and one may tend to all</b> other <b>public needs.</b> So too, <b>one may mark graves</b> to inform the public of their ritual impurity, <b>and</b> inspectors <b>may even go out to</b> uproot <b>the</b> shoots of prohibited <b>diverse kinds</b> [<b><i>kilayim</i>]</b> that grew in the fields during the rainy season.

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara begins by questioning the wording of the mishna: <b>Now</b> that <b>it has been said</b> that on the intermediate days of a Festival <b>one may irrigate</b> a field <b>from a newly emerged spring,</b> whose walls have not yet stabilized and are <b>likely to collapse,</b> necessitating laborious repairs, <b>is it necessary</b> to mention that one may irrigate a field <b>from a spring that did not just emerge,</b> whose walls have already stabilized <b>and are</b> therefore <b>not likely to collapse?</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: <b>They say</b> that <b>it was necessary</b> to mention the second case as well. For <b>had</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> us the <i>halakha</i> with regard to only <b>a newly emerged spring, I would have said</b> that <b>here,</b> in the case of <b>a field that requires irrigation, yes,</b> one is permitted to irrigate from such a spring, but in the case of <b>a field that</b> ordinarily <b>suffices with rainwater, no,</b> one is not permitted to do so, <b>because it is likely to collapse. But</b> with regard to <b>a spring that did not just emerge, that is not likely to collapse, I</b> might <b>say that</b> one may provide supplementary irrigation <b>even</b> in the case of <b>a field that</b> ordinarily <b>suffices with rainwater.</b>

### Part 6
Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that <b>a newly emerged spring is no different</b> from <b>a spring that did not just emerge.</b> In the case of <b>a field that requires irrigation, yes,</b> one may irrigate on the intermediate days of a Festival, while in the case of <b>a field that</b> ordinarily <b>suffices with rainwater, no,</b> one may not do so, even from an established spring.

### Part 7
The Gemara raises a question with regard to a linguistic issue: <b>And from where</b> may it <b>be inferred that this</b> term, <b><i>beit hashelaḥin</i>,</b> a field that requires irrigation, <b>is a term</b> denoting <b>thirst,</b> implying that supplementary watering is necessary? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “And you were faint and weary”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:18). The term faint is referring to the thirst of the Israelites in the desert. <b>And,</b> in the standard Aramaic translation, <b>we translate</b> the verse as: <b>And you were thirsty [<i>meshalhei</i>] and weary.</b> The letters <i>ḥet</i> and <i>heh</i> are sometimes interchanged, and therefore the term <i>beit hashelaḥin</i> connotes a thirsty field.

### Part 8
<b>And from where</b> may it <b>be inferred that this</b> term, <b><i>beit haba’al</i>,</b> a field that suffices with rainwater, <b>is a term denoting settlement,</b> i.e., an established field that does not require extensive upkeep? <b>As it is written: “For as a young man takes to himself [<i>yiv’al</i>] a virgin,</b> so shall your sons take you to themselves” (Isaiah 62:5). <b>And it is translated</b> in the Aramaic translation: <b>As a young man settles down with a virgin, so shall your sons become settled within you.</b> Similarly, <i>beit haba’al</i> is referring to a settled field that suffices with rainwater.

### Part 9
The Gemara begins to clarify the underlying principle of the mishna, asking: <b>Who is the</b> anonymous <b><i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna who maintains <b>that</b> labor performed to prevent a considerable <b>loss,</b> such as watering a field that requires irrigation, <b>yes,</b> it is permitted on the intermediate days of a Festival; but labor performed to increase one’s <b>profit,</b> such as watering a field that ordinarily suffices with rainwater, <b>no,</b> it is not permitted? Furthermore, <b>even in a case</b> involving <b>loss, one may not</b> excessively <b>exert</b> oneself, as the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna renders prohibited all cases of watering fields with collected rainwater or with water drawn with a shadoof, even in a field that requires irrigation.

### Part 10
<b>Rav Huna said: It is Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> In a field filled with trees, <b>one may draw water</b> via channels <b>from tree to tree, provided that</b> in doing so <b>he does not water the entire field.</b> As this field ordinarily suffices with rainwater, it is prohibited to water the entire field. Therefore, it is evident that Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov renders prohibited work performed to increase profit on the intermediate days of a Festival.

### Part 11
The Gemara challenges this comparison: <b>Say that you heard</b> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> ben Ya’akov holds that labor performed only to increase <b>profit is not</b> permitted. But <b>did you hear him</b> prohibit excessive <b>exertion in a case of</b> considerable <b>loss?</b> This aspect of the mishna finds no expression in the words of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov.

### Part 12
<b>Rather, Rav Pappa said:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From a newly emerged spring one may irrigate even a field that</b> ordinarily <b>suffices with rainwater;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: One may irrigate only a field requiring irrigation that dried up</b> and needs water. <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says: Neither the one nor the other. Furthermore, Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> Owing to the exertion involved, <b>one may not divert a water channel</b> from its regular path in order <b>to water his garden or his ruin,</b> which is now being used for planting, <b>during the intermediate days of a Festival.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara first clarifies the case of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>What</b> does Rabbi Yehuda mean when he speaks of a field that <b>is dried up? If we say</b> that the field is <b>literally dried up</b> and the plants are already parched, <b>why do I</b> need <b>to water it? Abaye said:</b> It means that <b>the one spring</b> from which the field had been irrigated until now <b>dried up, but</b> in the meantime <b>another spring emerged.</b> If the field is not irrigated from this spring, it will be ruined.

### Part 14
The Gemara explains the next clause of the <i>baraita</i>, which states: <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says: Neither the one nor the other.</b> By this he means that <b>it is no different</b> whether <b>the</b> original <b>spring dried up or did not dry up.</b> The guiding principle is: From <b>a newly emerged spring</b> one may <b>not</b> irrigate even a field that requires irrigation.

### Part 15
In any event, Rabbi Yehuda seems to maintain an opinion that is like that of the mishna, i.e., that only a field that requires irrigation may be watered, but not a field that suffices with rainwater. And even in the case of a field that requires irrigation, excessive exertion is prohibited. The Gemara challenges this understanding: <b>And from where</b> do you conclude that the mishna reflects the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda? <b>Perhaps Rabbi Yehuda stated</b> that <b>a field that requires irrigation, yes,</b> one may irrigate it on the intermediate days of a Festival, and <b>a field that suffices with rainwater, no,</b> one may not do so, <b>only</b> with regard to <b>a newly emerged spring,</b>
