### Part 1
<b>to a fair of</b> pagan <b>gentiles</b> held on a day they have designated for idol worship <b>and buy animals, slaves, maidservants, houses, fields, and vineyards</b> from them. <b>And he may write</b> the necessary deeds <b>and confirm</b> them <b>in their courts [<i>arkaot</i>]</b> by verifying the signatures on the documents to prevent the sellers from appealing and retracting the sale. Although this behavior might be construed as a display of respect for the gentiles and their idols, it is nevertheless permitted <b>because it is as if he were rescuing</b> his property <b>from their hands,</b> as he would not have another opportunity to acquire these items. This indicates that time-sensitive transactions are considered like cases where one might suffer financial loss, and are permitted.

### Part 2
It was related that <b>Rav permitted Ḥiyya bar Ashi to weave</b> simple <b>traps [<i>oharei</i>] on the intermediate days of a Festival.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is because <b>it is the work of a layman. However,</b> complex <b>nets [<i>izlei</i>] are prohibited. What is the reason? It is the work of a craftsman,</b> which is prohibited on the intermediate days of a Festival.

### Part 3
It was further related that <b>Rav Yehuda permitted Ami the oven maker to construct ovens</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival <b>and Rabba bar Ashabi to craft sieves.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is that</b> really <b>so? Didn’t Rabba bar Shmuel teach</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>And they</b> all <b>agree that one may not construct a new oven</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival. The Gemara answers that this is <b>not difficult: Here,</b> where Rav Yehuda permitted constructing an oven, he was referring <b>to the summer,</b> i.e., when the weather is hot and dry, so the oven can dry out and already be fit for use on the Festival; <b>there,</b> where the <i>baraita</i> prohibits constructing an oven, it is referring to <b>the rainy season,</b> i.e., when the weather is such that the oven will not be ready for use on the Festival.

### Part 4
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may construct a railing for a roof or a balcony</b> if it is done in a nonprofessional manner, as <b>the work of a layman, but not</b> if it is done skillfully, as <b>the work of a craftsman. One may plaster the cracks</b> in an oven <b>and roll over them with a roller,</b> a wooden tool used to smooth out clay, <b>with a hand or a foot, but not with a presser,</b> a tool that is specially designed for this task.

### Part 5
With regard to <b>the hinge</b> of a door, <b>and the cylinder</b> of the hinge, <b>and the</b> cross <b>beam</b> that holds the door, <b>and a lock and a key that broke, one may fix them on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival</b> as these items are essential for the Festival and their repair cannot be delayed. This is permitted, <b>provided that he does not intend</b> ahead of time <b>to do his labor on the Festival</b> and delay it until that time.

### Part 6
<b>And</b> with regard to <b>all preserved food from which one can eat on the Festival,</b> since they become ready to be eaten in a short amount of time, <b>he</b> may <b>preserve them</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival.

### Part 7
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> in which a railing is considered <b>the work of a layman? Rav Yosef said:</b> When it is made <b>with palm branches and</b> the branches of <b>bay trees,</b> which do not create a permanent structure. <b>It was taught in a <i>baraita</i></b> that <b>he fills in</b> the space <b>with stone but he does not plaster</b> the stones <b>with clay.</b>

### Part 8
It was taught in the mishna: <b>One may plaster the cracks</b> in an oven <b>and roll over them with a roller,</b> with a hand or a foot, but not with a presser. The Gemara asks: <b>Now</b> that <b>you said</b> that <b>it is permitted</b> to roll over the cracks <b>with a roller, is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to say that one may plaster the cracks <b>with a hand or a foot?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>this is what</b> the mishna <b>is saying: One may plaster the cracks</b> in an oven <b>and roll over them as if with a roller,</b> meaning <b>with a hand or a foot, but not with a presser,</b> which is a craftsman’s tool made especially for this.

### Part 9
It was taught in the mishna: With regard to <b>the hinge</b> of a door, <b>and the cylinder</b> of the hinge, <b>and the</b> cross <b>beam</b> that holds the door, <b>and a lock and a key that broke, one may fix them on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival.</b> The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> to this from a different mishna (<i>Ma’aser Sheni</i> 5:15): <b>Until the days</b> of Yoḥanan the High Priest, workmen’s <b>hammers would beat in Jerusalem</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival. One can deduce from this mishna that <b>until his days, yes,</b> the workmen’s hammers would beat, <b>but from then on, no,</b> because Yoḥanan the High Priest banned such work. This seems to contradict the mishna here that permits fixing certain items on the intermediate days of the Festival.

### Part 10
The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult: There,</b> when it is prohibited, it is referring to the work of <b>smiths,</b> which generates a great deal of noise; <b>here,</b> where it is permitted, it is referring to the work <b>of carpenters,</b> which is much quieter.

### Part 11
<b>Rav Ḥisda strongly objects to this:</b> If so, people <b>will say</b> that <b>a loud noise is prohibited,</b> but <b>a soft noise is permitted. Rather, Rav Ḥisda said</b> that the apparent contradiction is <b>not difficult</b> for a different reason: <b>This</b> mishna that permits labor is referring to <b>sickles,</b> as sickles emit no noise at all; whereas <b>that</b> mishna that prohibits labor is referring to <b>chisels. Rav Pappa said: Here</b> in the mishna it is referring to the period <b>before the decree</b> of Yoḥanan the High Priest; whereas <b>there</b> in the other mishna it is referring to the period <b>after the decree.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Rav Ashi said: That</b> mishna, which prohibits this labor, was taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda;</b> while <b>this</b> mishna was taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei. As Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Avdimi said: Who is the <i>tanna</i></b> who <b>taught</b> that all labor performed <b>on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival</b> must be done <b>with a change,</b> i.e., in an altered manner, even <b>with</b> regard to <b>a matter that will be lost</b> if timely action is not taken? It is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> as Rabbi Yosei permits doing labor that will prevent financial loss even when it is done in the usual manner.

### Part 13
<b>Ravina said: In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>do we now lift the lintel above the door</b> in order to drive in the nails that had loosened <b>on the intermediate days of a Festival</b> in the usual manner? <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this done? It is done <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> who permits labor that will prevent financial loss even when it is done in the usual manner.

### Part 14
§ It was taught in the mishna: With regard to all <b>preserved food from which he can eat on the Festival, he</b> may <b>preserve them</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival. The Gemara relates that the <b>Bedita</b> River once <b>overflowed,</b> depositing large quantities of <b>fish</b> in small water deposits on the river bank on the intermediate days of a Festival. <b>Everyone went and trapped and brought</b> home <b>fish,</b> and <b>Rava permitted them to salt</b> some <b>of</b> the fish.

### Part 15
<b>Abaye said to him: Didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: With regard to <b>all preserved food from which he can eat on the Festival, he</b> may <b>preserve them</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival? In this case it was impossible to eat that much fish on the Festival, and therefore preserving them should have been prohibited. Rava <b>said to him: Since they initially brought</b> these fish <b>with the intention of eating</b> them on the Festival, and it only became clear afterward that they had brought too many, <b>and if one would leave them</b> without salting them <b>they would be ruined, they are</b> treated <b>like merchandise that will be lost, and</b> therefore preserving them <b>is permitted.</b>

### Part 16
<b>And some say</b> that it did not happen in this manner, rather, <b>Rava permitted them to trap</b> the fish, <b>to bring them</b> home, <b>and to salt</b> them. <b>Abaye said to him: Didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: With regard to <b>all preserved food from which he can eat on the Festival, he</b> may <b>preserve them</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival? These fish were heavily salted and consequently could not be eaten until they thoroughly dried out.

### Part 17
Rava <b>said to him: These</b> fish that were just salted <b>can also be eaten</b> now, <b>by pressing</b> out the salt and brine, and therefore, they too are fit to be eaten on the Festival, <b>as in that</b> case <b>of Shmuel,</b> where <b>they prepared</b> recently salted fish <b>for him by pressing</b> it <b>sixty times and he ate</b> the fish. The Gemara relates that <b>Rava happened</b> to come <b>to the house of the Exilarch</b> and <b>they prepared</b> freshly salted fish <b>for him by pressing</b> it <b>sixty times, and he ate</b> it.

### Part 18
Apropos eating fish in various ways, the Gemara relates that <b>Rav</b> once <b>happened</b> to come <b>to the house of Rav Shapir,</b> and <b>they brought before him a certain fish,</b> of which <b>one- third</b> was <b>cooked, one-third</b> was <b>salted</b> and made edible via pressing, and <b>one-third</b> was <b>broiled.</b>

### Part 19
<b>Rav said: Adda the fisherman told me</b> that <b>a fish</b> that has sat for some time and is <b>close to spoiling is</b> at its <b>best. And Rav</b> also <b>said: Adda the fisherman told me:</b> With regard to <b>a fish, broil it with its brother,</b> i.e., with salt, which, like fish, also comes from the sea; <b>place it in its father,</b> i.e., in water; and <b>eat it with its son,</b> i.e., with fish brine which comes from it; <b>and drink after it its father,</b> i.e., water.

### Part 20
<b>And</b> in addition <b>Rav said: Adda the fisherman told me:</b> After eating <b>fish, cress, and milk, let the body carry them and let not the bed carry them,</b> i.e., it is advisable to go for a walk after eating them, rather than immediately going to sleep. <b>And Rav said: Adda the fisherman told me:</b> After eating <b>fish, cress, and milk,</b> it is better to drink <b>water and not beer,</b> and if he has no water, he should drink <b>beer and not wine,</b> in order to avoid harming his body.
