### Part 1
§ It was taught in the mishna: <b>A layman,</b> who is not a skilled tailor, may <b>sew in his</b> usual <b>manner</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> in which an individual is considered <b>a layman?</b> The Sages <b>of the school of Rabbi Yannai said: Anyone who cannot</b> deftly <b>pull a full needle</b> of stiches through the fabric <b>at the same time</b> is considered a layman. <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: Anyone who cannot form a straight seam on the hem [<i>ḥefet</i>] of his shirt</b> is considered a layman.

### Part 2
§ It was further taught in the mishna: <b>A craftsman,</b> however, <b>may form</b> only <b>temporary stitches [<i>makhliv</i>].</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> meant by <b>forming temporary stitches? Rabbi Yoḥanan said: He</b> does not sew all the stitches that are necessary, but rather <b>he skips</b> certain stitches in the middle (Rabbeinu Hananel). <b>Rabba bar Shmuel said:</b> He sews stitches that are like <b>the teeth of a dog.</b> He does not sew all the stitches in a straight line, so that they resemble the teeth of a dog, which also are not straight.

### Part 3
§ It was also taught in the mishna: <b>One may interweave</b> the cords attached to the frame of <b>a bed.</b> Rabbi Yosei says: One may only tighten the cords. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> meant by <b>interweaving, and what is</b> meant by <b>tightening? When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said: Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba and Rabbi Asi disagree about</b> the matter, <b>and both of them</b> reported their opinions <b>in the name of Ḥizkiyya and Rabbi Yoḥanan. One</b> Sage <b>said: Interweaving</b> involves placing and tying the cords of the bed both <b>lengthwise and widthwise,</b> whereas <b>tightening</b> means arranging the cords only <b>lengthwise and not widthwise. And one</b> Sage <b>said: Interweaving</b> involves arranging the cords only <b>lengthwise and not widthwise, while tightening</b> means <b>that if</b> a cord <b>became loose, he</b> may <b>tighten it</b> but he may not tie any new cords.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? Didn’t Rav Taḥlifa bar Shaul teach</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> both Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yosei <b>agree that one may not braid cords anew</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival? <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that <b>interweaving</b> means tying the cords <b>lengthwise and widthwise, and tightening</b> means tying them only <b>lengthwise and not widthwise, this</b> explanation is consistent with <b>that which Rav Taḥlifa taught: And they</b> both <b>agree that one may not braid cords anew,</b> as even though one is permitted to arrange the cords of the bed, he is not permitted to produce new cords.

### Part 5
<b>However, according to the one who said</b> that <b>interweaving</b> means tying the cords only <b>lengthwise and not widthwise,</b> while <b>tightening</b> means <b>that if</b> a cord <b>became loose, he</b> may <b>tighten it,</b> there is a difficulty. <b>Now</b> that <b>you said</b> that tying the cords <b>lengthwise and widthwise, no,</b> it is not permitted even though the cords are readily available, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to say that braiding <b>cords anew</b> is prohibited? The Gemara comments: Indeed <b>it</b> is <b>difficult.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said to Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin: Is there one who says that interweaving</b> means tying the cords <b>lengthwise, but not widthwise? Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 16:1) that <b>Rabbi Meir says: A bed</b> is considered a utensil and becomes susceptible to ritual impurity <b>from when one interweaves three</b> rows of <b>meshes in it,</b> i.e., three rows lengthwise and widthwise? It is clear from here that interweaving a bed involves tying its cords lengthwise and widthwise.

### Part 7
<b>Rather, when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <b>he stated</b> a different version of the tradition: <b>With regard to interweaving, everyone agrees</b> that it is referring to tying the cords of a bed <b>lengthwise and widthwise. When they disagree it is only about</b> the meaning of <b>tightening. One Sage holds</b> that <b>tightening</b> means arranging the cords only <b>lengthwise and not widthwise. And one Sage holds</b> that it means that <b>if</b> a cord <b>became loose, he may tighten it.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may interweave</b> the cords attached to the frame of <b>a bed</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival, <b>and needless to say one may tighten</b> those cords; <b>this is the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yosei says: One may</b> only <b>tighten</b> the ropes <b>but not interweave</b> them. <b>And some say: One may not tighten</b> them <b>at all.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that <b>tightening</b> means tying the cords only <b>lengthwise and not widthwise, this is</b> why the opinion presented as: <b>Some say, comes to disagree</b> and says that one may not tie the cords at all, even only lengthwise. However, if the cords became loose, all agree that they may be tightened. <b>But according to the one who said</b> that tightening means <b>that if</b> a cord <b>became loose he</b> may <b>tighten it,</b> then <b>according to</b> the opinion presented here as: <b>Some say,</b> may <b>he not even tighten</b> the cords of his bed? How, then, would he be able to sleep on it?

### Part 10
The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> indeed, according to this opinion, it is prohibited even to tighten the cords of one’s bed. <b>Since it is possible</b> for him <b>to fill</b> the depression in his bed <b>with clothing,</b> so that he can sleep there, <b>he</b> may <b>not exert</b> himself during the week of the Festival and fix the bed in a more permanent manner.

### Part 11
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may set up an oven, a stove, and a mill on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival. Rabbi Yehuda says: One may not chisel millstones for the first time</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival.

### Part 12
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> meant by <b>chiseling</b> millstones? <b>Rav Yehuda said: Cutting</b> grooves into <b>the millstones.</b> As the millstones wear down over time and become smooth, one must occasionally cut grooves into the stones so that they can grind properly. <b>Rav Yeḥiel said:</b> Cutting out <b>an eyehole</b> in the upper millstone, through which the grain can pass, so that it can be ground between the two millstones.

### Part 13
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may set up an oven and a stove on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival, provided that he does not</b> fully <b>complete the labor;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. But the Rabbis say: He</b> may <b>even complete</b> the labor. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of</b> Rabbi Eliezer: <b>One may set up a new</b> millstone <b>and one may chisel an old</b> millstone. <b>And some say: One may not chisel</b> a millstone <b>at all.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that <b>chiseling</b> a millstone means <b>cutting</b> grooves into <b>the millstones, this is</b> how <b>you</b> can <b>find</b> this activity relevant <b>to an old</b> mill. <b>But according to the one who said</b> it means cutting out <b>an eyehole, why does an old</b> millstone <b>need an eyehole</b> to be cut out? It must have one already. The Gemara answers: This is referring to a case <b>where he wants to widen</b> the hole <b>a little more.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Huna</b> once <b>heard a certain man cutting</b> grooves into <b>his millstone on the intermediate days of a Festival. He said: Who is this?</b> May <b>his body be desecrated, for he desecrates the intermediate days of a Festival.</b> The Gemara comments: Rav Huna <b>holds in accordance</b> with the statement cited as: <b>Some say,</b> that one is not permitted to roughen his millstones at all.

### Part 16
<b>Rav Ḥama taught</b> as follows: <b>One may cut</b> grooves into <b>millstones on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival. In the name of Rabbi Meir he said: Even</b> with regard to <b>the horse that</b> one <b>rides upon and the donkey that he rides upon, he is permitted to trim</b> their <b>hooves</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival so that they do not suffer when they walk.
