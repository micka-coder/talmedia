### Part 1
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan asked of Shmuel: Is there</b> some <b>mourning on Shabbat or is there no mourning on Shabbat</b> at all? <b>He said to him: There is no mourning on Shabbat</b> at all.

### Part 2
<b>The Sages sat before Rav Pappa and said in the name of Shmuel: A mourner who engaged in sexual relations during his days of mourning is liable</b> to receive <b>the death penalty</b> at the hand of Heaven. <b>Rav Pappa said to them: It was said</b> that sexual relations are <b>prohibited,</b> but not that the offender is guilty of a capital crime. <b>And</b> the ruling <b>was said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> and not in the name of Shmuel.

### Part 3
<b>And if you heard</b> a statement on this issue <b>in the name of Shmuel,</b> then <b>you heard as follows: Rav Taḥlifa bar Avimi said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: A mourner who did not let</b> his hair <b>grow wild and did not rend</b> his garments <b>is liable</b> to receive <b>the death penalty</b> at the hand of Heaven, <b>as it is stated</b> following the deaths of Nadab and Abihu concerning the surviving sons of Aaron: <b>“Let not the hair of your heads go loose, neither rend your clothes, that you not die”</b> (Leviticus 10:6). They were instructed not to mourn, so as not to interfere with the dedication of the Tabernacle. From here it may be deduced <b>that</b> any <b>other</b> mourner <b>who did not let</b> his hair <b>grow wild or rend</b> his clothes <b>is liable</b> to receive <b>the death penalty.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rafram bar Pappa said:</b> A Sage <b>taught in <i>Evel Rabbati</i>,</b> a separate tractate devoted to the <i>halakhot</i> of mourning: <b>A mourner is prohibited from engaging in sexual relations during his days of mourning.</b> There was <b>an incident with one who engaged in sexual relations during his days of mourning and</b> he was punished, for after his death <b>pigs dragged away his corpse.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Shmuel</b> offered a mnemonic device with regard to the observance of mourning rites on Shabbat, and <b>said: <i>Peh</i>, <i>ḥet</i>, <i>zayin</i> are obligatory.</b> These letters combine to create a mnemonic standing for: Uncovering the head [<i>periat rosh</i>], reversing the torn garment [<i>ḥazarat kera</i>], and standing the bed upright [<i>zekifat hamitta</i>]. However, <b><i>nun</i>, <i>tav</i>, <i>reish</i>,</b> which stand for: Wearing shoes [<i>ne’ilat hasandal</i>], marital relations [<i>tashmish hamitta</i>], and hand washing [<i>reḥitzat yadayim</i>], <b>are optional.</b>

### Part 6
This is explained: <b>Uncovering the head,</b> i.e., removing the head covering usually worn by a mourner; <b>reversing the tear to the back,</b> so that it will not be visible; and <b>standing the bed upright</b> in the usual position, so that it is not overturned, are all <b>obligatory</b> for the mourner to uphold in honor of Shabbat. However, <b>wearing shoes, engaging in sexual relations,</b> and <b>washing one’s hands and feet in hot water in the evening are optional</b> activities on Shabbat. If a mourner wishes to refrain from them he may do so. <b>And Rav said: Uncovering the head is also an optional</b> activity.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>According to Shmuel, what is different about wearing shoes</b> that it is <b>optional?</b> His reasoning presumably is that <b>not everyone wears shoes</b> at all times, and therefore not wearing shoes will not be perceived by others as a sign of mourning. If so, the same thing may be said about <b>uncovering the head also,</b> i.e., <b>not everyone uncovers his head</b> at all times, as some people always walk around with their heads wrapped. This, too, should not be seen as a clear display of mourning, and therefore uncovering one’s head should also be treated as optional.

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: <b>Shmuel</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning,</b> for <b>Shmuel said: Any rending</b> of garments <b>that is not</b> done <b>at the time of</b> the <b>most intense</b> grief, i.e., the time of death, <b>is not</b> considered proper <b>rending</b> of garments. <b>And any wrapping</b> of the head <b>that is not</b> done <b>in the manner of the wrapping of the Ishmaelites,</b> who wrap their heads on all sides, <b>is not</b> considered proper <b>wrapping.</b> Since Shmuel requires that a mourner wrap his head in this special manner, one who acts in this way on Shabbat openly displays his mourning, as people do not ordinarily wrap their heads in this manner. What is this wrapping? <b>Rav Naḥman demonstrated</b> the procedure by covering up his face to the <b>sides of the beard,</b> leaving only the center of his face exposed.

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Ya’akov said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: They taught</b> that a mourner is required to remove his head covering on Shabbat <b>only when he has no shoes on his feet,</b> so that he not appear too obviously to be in mourning. <b>But if he has shoes on his feet,</b> then <b>his shoes prove</b> that <b>he</b> is not observing the rites of mourning on Shabbat.

### Part 10
The Gemara returns to Shmuel’s statement that <b>any rending</b> of garments <b>that is not</b> done <b>at the time of most intense</b> grief and pain <b>is not</b> considered proper <b>rending</b> of garments. The Gemara poses a question: <b>But</b> when <b>they said to Shmuel</b> that <b>Rav had passed away, he rent twelve garments on account of him, and said: The man of whom I was in fear,</b> owing to his great learning, <b>has gone</b> and died. Similarly, when <b>they told Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina had passed away, he rent thirteen</b> expensive <b>wool [<i>mileta</i>] garments [<i>itztelei</i>] on account of him, and said: The man of whom I was in fear has gone.</b> When each of these Sages received the news that their distinguished colleague had died, it was no longer the time of the most intense grief, i.e., the time of death, and yet they rent their garments.

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: <b>The Sages are different. Since their teachings are mentioned all the time,</b> every time they are mentioned <b>is like the time of most intense</b> grief, as the pain over their death is once again renewed.

### Part 12
<b>Ravin bar Adda said to Rava: Your student, Rav Amram, said</b> that <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> as follows: For <b>all seven days</b> of mourning, <b>a mourner</b> must keep <b>the tear</b> in his garment <b>before him</b> so that it will be seen. <b>And if he comes to change</b> clothing, <b>he changes and rends</b> the new garment. <b>On Shabbat,</b> he turns <b>the tear to his back, and if he comes to change</b> clothing, <b>he changes but does not tear</b> the second garment. From here it seems that there is an obligation to rend garments during the entire week of mourning, not only at the most intense moment of grief.

### Part 13
The Gemara answers: <b>When that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught,</b> it is referring to the specific case of rending one’s garment <b>in honor of his father or mother.</b> Owing to the special honor due to one’s parents, it is inappropriate for the child to wear a garment that is not torn. Consequently, if he changes clothing, he must tear the new garment, even if it is no longer the most intense time of grief.

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>Those</b> additional <b>tears</b> that are made in honor of one’s father or mother, <b>may they be</b> properly <b>mended</b> at the end of the son’s period of mourning, <b>or may they not be</b> properly <b>mended,</b> like the tear made for one’s father or mother at the most intense moment of grief? The Gemara answers: <b>They disagree about</b> this issue, <b>the father of Rav Oshaya and bar Kappara. One said: They may not be mended, and one said: They may be mended.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara comments: <b>Conclude that</b> it was <b>Rav Oshaya’s father</b> who <b>said</b> that such rents <b>may not be</b> properly <b>mended, for Rav Oshaya said:</b> Such rents <b>may not be</b> properly <b>mended. From whom did he hear</b> this <i>halakha</i>? Was it <b>not from his father?</b> The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>No,</b> this cannot be offered as a proof, as perhaps <b>he heard it from bar Kappara,</b> who was <b>his teacher.</b>

### Part 16
§ <b>Rava said: A mourner may walk about his house in</b> a torn <b>robe [<i>unkali</i>]</b> on Shabbat, since he is not doing so in public. It was related that <b>Abaye found Rav Yosef walking back and forth in his house</b> on Shabbat when he was in mourning <b>with a scarf spread over his head</b> in the manner of mourning. <b>He said to him: Master, do you not maintain</b> that <b>there is no mourning on Shabbat? He said to him: This is what Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Matters that are in private apply,</b> and so when one is in his house he must observe the rites of mourning even on Shabbat.

### Part 17
§ The mishna taught: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Since the Temple was destroyed, <i>Shavuot</i> is like Shabbat</b> with regard to mourning. Rabban Gamliel says: Even Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur are considered like Festivals. The Gemara comments that <b>Rav Giddel bar Menashya said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Gamliel.</b>

### Part 18
<b>And some teach this</b> ruling <b>of Rav Giddel bar Menashya</b> as referring <b>to the following</b> case: It is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: Within the first <b>thirty days</b> after birth, <b>an infant</b> that dies <b>is taken out</b> for burial <b>in</b> one’s <b>bosom,</b> that is to say, he is carried to his grave in one’s arms, not in a coffin. <b>And he is buried by one woman and two men,</b> there being no need for a quorum of ten men. <b>But</b> he should <b>not</b> be taken out <b>by one man and two women,</b> because it is prohibited for one man to seclude himself with two women.
