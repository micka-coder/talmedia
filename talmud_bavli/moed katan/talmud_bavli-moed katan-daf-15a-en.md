### Part 1
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> governing <b>those who are ostracized and lepers,</b> with regard to <b>a haircut?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear that which</b> was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Those who are ostracized and lepers are prohibited from cutting</b> their hair <b>and laundering</b> their clothes.

### Part 2
It was further taught there: If <b>one who is ostracized dies, the court</b> places <b>stones on his coffin. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> This does <b>not</b> mean <b>that they pile up a heap of stones over him like the heap</b> of stones that was placed over the grave <b>of Achan</b> (see Joshua 7:26). <b>Rather, the court sends</b> its agents, <b>who place a large stone on his coffin</b> as a symbolic gesture. This comes <b>to teach you</b> that <b>anyone who is ostracized and dies while in his</b> period of <b>ostracism,</b> without seeking to be released from it, <b>the court</b> places <b>stones on his coffin.</b>

### Part 3
§ The Gemara continues: <b>A mourner is obligated to wrap</b> his <b>head</b> as a sign of mourning, covering his head and face. This is derived from the fact <b>that the Merciful One says to Ezekiel,</b> while he is in mourning: <b>“And cover not your upper lip”</b> (Ezekiel 24:17). God commands Ezekiel not to display outward signs of mourning, which proves <b>by inference that everyone</b> else <b>is obligated</b> to wrap their heads in this manner.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing <b>a person who is ostracized,</b> with regard to <b>wrapping of the head? Rav Yosef said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which was taught in a <i>baraita</i> about those who were fasting for rain and whose prayers were not answered: <b>And they wrap themselves and sit as those who are ostracized and as mourners, until they are shown mercy from Heaven.</b> This implies that those who are ostracized must wrap their heads like mourners. <b>Abaye said to him: Perhaps one who is ostracized by Heaven is different, as that is more serious</b> than being ostracized by an earthly court.

### Part 5
The Gemara continues and asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case of <b>a leper</b> with regard to <b>wrapping of the head? Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof based upon the verse: <b>“And he shall cover his upper lip”</b> (Leviticus 13:45), from which it may be learned <b>by inference that he is obligated to wrap</b> his <b>head.</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from here</b> that this is the case.

### Part 6
§ The Gemara moves on to another <i>halakha</i>: <b>A mourner is prohibited from donning phylacteries.</b> This is derived from the fact <b>that the Merciful One says to Ezekiel,</b> while he is in mourning: <b>“Bind your headwear [<i>pe’er</i>] upon yourself”</b> (Ezekiel 24:17). The word <i>pe’er</i> alludes to phylacteries. Ezekiel was unique in that he was commanded to put on phylacteries while in mourning, which proves <b>by inference that everyone</b> else <b>is prohibited</b> from doing so.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing <b>one who is ostracized,</b> with regard to phylacteries? The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved. The Gemara proceeds to its next question: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case of <b>a leper</b> with regard to phylacteries? The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the following <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And the leper”</b> (Leviticus 13:45); as explained earlier, this comes <b>to include the High Priest</b> in all the <i>halakhot</i> of the leper. The verse states there: <b>“His garments shall be <i>perumim</i>,”</b> meaning <b>that they shall be rent.</b> The verse continues: <b>“And his head shall be <i>parua</i>,”</b> and this <b><i>peria</i></b> means <b>only growing the hair long;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The meaning of these terms is derived through a verbal analogy. The verse <b>states</b> a form of the verb <b>being, with regard to</b> one’s <b>head</b> in the verse: “His head shall be,” teaching that a leper must perform a certain action with his head. <b>And the verse states</b> a form of the verb <b>being with regard to</b> a leper’s <b>garment,</b> in the verse: “His garment shall be.” <b>Just as</b> the term <b>being stated with regard to</b> his <b>garment</b> is referring to <b>an object external to his body, so too,</b> the term <b>being</b> used <b>with regard to</b> his <b>head</b> is referring to <b>an object external to his body.</b> The Gemara derives from this: <b>What, is it not</b> referring to <b>phylacteries,</b> and the verse teaches that it is prohibited for a leper to wear phylacteries?

### Part 9
<b>Rav Pappa said: No,</b> there is no proof from here, as the verse may be referring <b>to a cap [<i>kumta</i>] or a scarf [<i>sudara</i>],</b> which people wear on their heads. It is possible to explain that according to Rabbi Akiva, it is prohibited for a leper to wear such headwear because it is excessive adornment.

### Part 10
§ The Gemara continues: <b>A mourner is prohibited from greeting</b> others or be greeted. This is derived from the fact <b>that the Merciful One says to Ezekiel: “Sigh in silence”</b> (Ezekiel 24:17), implying that aside from what was absolutely essential, he was prohibited from speaking.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing <b>one who is ostracized</b> with regard to <b>greeting</b> others? <b>Rav Yosef said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i> dealing with those who were fasting for rain and whose prayers were not answered. These people were prohibited <b>from greeting one another, as people who are reprimanded by the Omnipresent.</b> This indicates that those who are ostracized must not greet each other, just as mourners may not greet each other. <b>Abaye said to him: Perhaps one who is ostracized by Heaven is different, as that is more serious</b> than being ostracized by an earthly court.

### Part 12
The Gemara continues and asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>a leper</b> with regard to <b>greeting</b> others? The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the following <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And he shall cover his upper lip”</b> (Leviticus 13:45). This means that <b>his lips should be stuck together, that he should be like one who is ostracized and like a mourner, and he is prohibited from greeting</b> others or being greeted. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from this</b> that this is so.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: If this is the case, then <b>we should</b> also <b>resolve</b> the question asked above <b>with regard to one who is ostracized</b> and say that such a person is prohibited from offering greetings. <b>Rav Aḥa bar Pineḥas said in the name of Rav Yosef: Does it</b> explicitly <b>teach</b> that a leper <b>is prohibited</b> from greeting others, like one who is ostracized? <b>It teaches</b> only <b>that he should be</b> treated <b>like one who is ostracized and like a mourner,</b> i.e., he should be like them <b>with regard to other things, and</b> that <b>he is also prohibited from greeting</b> others. This being the case, no proof can be derived from here with regard to whether or not one who is ostracized may offer greetings.

### Part 14
§ The Gemara moves on to a new topic: <b>A mourner is prohibited</b> from studying <b>words of Torah.</b> This prohibition is derived <b>from</b> the fact <b>that the Merciful One says to Ezekiel:</b> “Sigh in <b>silence”</b> (Ezekiel 24:17). Ezekiel was commanded to be silent and not discuss even Torah matters.

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>one who is ostracized</b> with regard to speaking <b>words of Torah? Rav Yosef said: Come</b> and <b>hear that which</b> was taught in the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who is ostracized may teach</b> Torah to others, <b>and</b> others <b>may teach him</b> Torah. Similarly, <b>he may be hired</b> for work by others, <b>and</b> others <b>may be hired by him.</b>

### Part 16
<b>One who has been excommunicated,</b> which is a more severe form of ostracism, <b>may not teach</b> Torah to others <b>and</b> others <b>may not teach him. He may not be hired</b> by others, <b>and</b> others <b>may not be hired by him. However, he may study by himself,</b> so <b>that he will not interrupt his study</b> entirely and forget everything he knows. <b>And he may build a small store for his livelihood,</b> so that he can earn enough money to cover his most basic needs, but not more.

### Part 17
<b>And Rav said:</b> What is the small store referred to here? This is referring to <b>selling water in the valley of Aravot,</b> where no water was to be found. One selling water there could earn a small income. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from this</b> <i>baraita</i> that one who is ostracized is permitted to study Torah.

### Part 18
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a leper</b> speaking <b>words of Torah?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: It is written: <b>“And you shall impart them to your children and your children’s children; the day that you stood before the Lord your God in Horeb”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:9–10). <b>Just as there,</b> the revelation at Sinai was <b>in reverence, fear, and trembling,</b> so too, here, in every generation, Torah must be studied in a similar fashion.

### Part 19
<b>From here</b> the Sages <b>stated: <i>Zavim</i>, lepers, and those who had intercourse with menstruating women</b> despite their severe ritual impurity <b>are permitted to read the Torah, Prophets, and Writings, and to study midrash, Talmud, <i>halakhot</i>, and <i>aggada</i>. But those who experienced a seminal emission are prohibited</b> from doing so. The reason for this distinction is that the cases of severe impurity are caused by ailment or other circumstances beyond one’s control; as a result, they do not necessarily preclude a sense of reverence and awe as one studies Torah. However, a seminal emission usually occurs due to frivolity and a lack of reverence and awe, and it is therefore inappropriate for one who experiences a seminal emission to engage in matters of Torah. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from this</b> that a leper is permitted to study words of Torah.

### Part 20
§ The Gemara proceeds to discuss another issue: <b>A mourner is prohibited from laundering his clothes, as it is written: “And Joab sent to Tekoa, and fetched from there a wise woman, and said to her, I pray you, feign yourself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and do not anoint yourself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead”</b> (II Samuel 14:2).

### Part 21
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>laundering</b> with regard to <b>those who are ostracized or lepers? Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Those who are ostracized or lepers are prohibited from cutting</b> their hair <b>or laundering</b> their clothes. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from</b> here that they are prohibited from laundering their clothes.

### Part 22
The Gemara continues: <b>A mourner is obligated to rend</b> his clothes. This is derived from the fact <b>that the Merciful One says to the sons of Aaron: “Neither rend</b> your clothes” (Leviticus 10:6), which proves <b>by inference that everyone</b> else, all other mourners, <b>are obligated</b> to rend their clothes.

### Part 23
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>rending</b> clothes with regard to <b>one who is ostracized</b>? No answer is found, and the question <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 24
The Gemara continues: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>a leper</b> with regard to <b>rending? Come</b> and <b>hear that which</b> is taught in the following <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“His garments shall be rent”</b> (Leviticus 13:45), meaning <b>that they shall be torn.</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from here</b> that this is the case.

### Part 25
§ The Gemara moves to a different issue: <b>A mourner is obligated to overturn</b> his <b>bed,</b> so that he sleeps on the underside of it, <b>as bar Kappara taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> that states:
