### Part 1
<b>Abba Shaul says:</b> The infant may be taken out <b>even by one man and two women,</b> for there is no concern with regard to seclusion in a time of mourning. <b>And for</b> such an infant, people <b>do not stand in a line</b> to offer their condolences to the mourners, as is ordinarily done after a burial; <b>nor do</b> others <b>recite over him the mourners’ blessing,</b> which is recited in the courtyard of the graveyard after the burial; <b>nor</b> is the usual formula for the <b>consolation of mourners</b> recited during the seven days of mourning.

### Part 2
<b>A thirty-day-old</b> infant that dies <b>is taken out</b> for burial <b>in a coffin [<i>deluskema</i>]. Rabbi Yehuda says: Not in</b> a small <b>coffin that is carried on</b> one’s <b>shoulder, but rather</b> in a coffin that is carried <b>in the arms</b> of two people. <b>And for</b> such an infant, people <b>stand in a line</b> to offer their condolences to the mourners. <b>And</b> others <b>recite the mourners’ blessing</b> at the cemetery. <b>And</b> people recite <b>the consolation of mourners</b> during the week of mourning.

### Part 3
<b>A twelve-month-old</b> infant <b>is taken out</b> for burial <b>on a bier,</b> just as an adult is. <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> This <i>halakha</i> applies if the infant that dies <b>is one year old and his limbs are like</b> those of <b>a two year old,</b> so that he looks older, or if <b>he is two years old and his limbs are like</b> those of <b>a one-year-old.</b> Only then <b>he is taken out on a bier.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: For one that is taken out on a bier, the public should grieve [<i>matzhivin</i>]. For one that is not taken out on a bier, the public need not grieve. Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says:</b> The <i>halakha</i> is as follows: If the infant was <b>known to the public,</b> because he regularly left the house and many people knew him, <b>the public must occupy themselves with him</b> and participate in his burial. If <b>he was not known to the public, the public need not occupy themselves with him.</b>

### Part 5
<b>And what is the</b> status of deceased infants <b>with regard to eulogy? Rabbi Meir said in the name of Rabbi Yishmael:</b> The children of <b>the poor</b> are eulogized from <b>the age of three,</b> whereas the children of <b>the wealthy</b> are eulogized from <b>the age of five.</b> This is because a child is the sole source of joy for the poor, and so the pain and grief of the poor over the death of a child is greater than that of the wealthy. <b>Rabbi Yehuda said in the name of</b> Rabbi Yishmael: The children of <b>the poor</b> are eulogized from <b>the age of five,</b> whereas the children of <b>the wealthy</b> are eulogized from <b>the age of six. And the children of the elderly are</b> treated <b>like the children of the poor,</b> for the death of a child is particularly painful for an older person.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Giddel bar Menashya said</b> that <b>Rav said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who stated it in the name of Rabbi Yishmael.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Anani bar Sason taught at the entrance to the house of the <i>Nasi</i>:</b> If one suffered the loss of a close relative shortly before the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>, his <b>one day</b> of mourning <b>before <i>Shavuot</i> and <i>Shavuot</i></b> itself together count as <b>fourteen</b> days. The day before the Festival counts as seven full days of mourning because the Festival interrupts the seven-day period of mourning, and the Festival itself is counted as a seven-day Festival. Even though it is a one-day Festival, it is counted as seven days because it has the same <i>halakha</i> as the other Festivals. After <i>Shavuot</i>, then, only sixteen days are left to complete the thirty-day mourning period. <b>Rabbi Ami heard</b> this <b>and became angry</b> with him. <b>He said: Is that to say</b> that it is <b>his own</b> opinion? <b>It is</b> the opinion <b>that Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya</b> said.

### Part 8
Similarly <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa taught in the pavilion [<i>kila</i>] of the Exilarch:</b> If one’s relative died shortly before the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>, his <b>one day</b> of mourning <b>before <i>Shavuot</i> and <i>Shavuot</i></b> itself count as <b>fourteen</b> days. <b>Rav Sheshet heard and became angry.</b> He <b>said: Is that to say</b> that it is <b>his own</b> opinion? <b>It is</b> the opinion <b>that Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya</b> said.

### Part 9
In both of these cases, a Sage presented an opinion as their own, without attributing it to the original Sage who stated it, <b>for Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the <i>Shavuot</i></b> offerings <b>have redress all seven</b> subsequent <b>days?</b> That is to say, if someone failed to bring the Festival offering on the Festival itself, he has six more days to bring it. <b>As it is stated:</b> “Three times a year shall all your males appear before the Lord your God in the place that He shall choose; <b>on the festival of Passover, and on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>,</b> and on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>” (Deuteronomy 16:16). <b>Just as</b> the offerings of <b>the festival of Passover have redress all seven</b> days, as Passover is seven days long, <b>so too</b> the offerings of <b>the festival of <i>Shavuot</i> have redress all seven</b> days, during the week following <i>Shavuot</i>. From this we learn that <i>Shavuot</i> is treated like a seven-day Festival for all halakhic purposes.

### Part 10
<b>Rav Pappa granted permission to Rav Avya the Elder</b> to speak <b>and he taught</b> the following in public: If one’s relative died shortly before Rosh HaShana, his <b>one day</b> of mourning <b>before Rosh HaShana and Rosh HaShana</b> itself together count as <b>fourteen</b> days, because Rosh HaShana is treated like a seven-day Festival. <b>Ravina said: Therefore,</b> if a one’s relative died shortly before <i>Sukkot</i>, his <b>one day</b> of mourning <b>before the Festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>and the Festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i> itself, which is seven days, <b>and its Eighth</b> day of Assembly, which is considered to be a separate Festival, count as <b>twenty-one</b> days, and he must observe only nine more days of mourning to complete the thirty-day period of mourning.

### Part 11
It was related that <b>Ravina happened</b> to come <b>to</b> the city of <b>Sura on the Euphrates</b> River. <b>Rav Ḥaviva from Sura on the Euphrates said to Ravina:</b> Did the <b>Master say</b> that <b>one day</b> of mourning <b>before Rosh HaShana and Rosh HaShana</b> itself count <b>as fourteen</b> days? <b>He said to him: I said that it stands to reason</b> that this is so <b>according to Rabban Gamliel,</b> who maintains that Rosh HaShana is treated like a pilgrim Festival. But I did not rule in accordance with this opinion.

### Part 12
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Mourners <b>do not rend</b> their garments during the intermediate days of a Festival <b>and do not remove</b> their garments from their shoulders. <b>And</b> others <b>do not provide them with a meal [<i>mavrin</i>]</b> after the burial, <b>except for close relatives of the deceased. And</b> the consolers <b>provide the</b> first <b>meal</b> after the burial <b>only</b> while the mourner is sitting <b>on an upright bed,</b> and not on one that is overturned.
