<b>as</b> it is <b>for a knotted rope [<i>tzippori</i>] to pass through an eye [<i>veshet</i>]</b> in a ship’s rigging. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It is as difficult <b>as</b> it is <b>for a halyard [<i>pitirei</i>] to pass through an eye [<i>veshet</i>].</b>

### Part 5
<b>And Rabbi Levi said: Anyone who leaves from the synagogue</b> and goes <b>to the study hall or</b> goes <b>from the study hall to the synagogue,</b> i.e., he goes from the mitzva of prayer to the mitzva of Torah study or vice versa, <b>merits to receive the Divine Presence, as it is stated: “They go from strength to strength, every one of them appears before God in Zion”</b> (Psalms 84:8).

### Part 6
With regard to the same verse, <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi said</b> that <b>Rav said: Torah scholars have no rest, even in the World-to-Come,</b> as even there they remain in constant movement and ascent, <b>as it is stated: “They go from strength to strength, every one of them appears before God in Zion.”</b> Even when they are in the World-to-Come, they continue to go from strength to strength, until the final redemption will arrive in the end of days and God will appear in Zion.
