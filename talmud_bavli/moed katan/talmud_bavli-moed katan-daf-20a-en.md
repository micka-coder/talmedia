### Part 1
<b>for they already occupied themselves with him</b> when they came to console him <b>during the Festival. The</b> general <b>principle with regard to the matter</b> is as follows: <b>Any</b> activity <b>that</b> is prohibited to the mourner <b>because it is</b> an expression of <b>mourning is interrupted by the Festival</b> and remains prohibited afterward. <b>And anything that involves the public’s occupation</b> with the mourner, e.g., coming to the mourner to offer him comfort and condolence, <b>is not interrupted by the Festival,</b> for people console the mourner during the Festival as well.

### Part 2
If <b>he</b> buries his relative <b>three days</b> before <b>the end of the Festival,</b> the mourner <b>must count seven</b> days of mourning <b>after the Festival</b> because his mourning never began. On the <b>first four days</b> of his mourning, <b>the public must occupy themselves with him</b> and come to console him. On <b>the three last days,</b> however, <b>the public need not occupy themselves with him, as they already occupied themselves with him during the Festival.</b> That is to say, they certainly came to console him during the Festival, although the period of mourning did not actually begin until afterward. <b>And the Festival counts for him</b> toward the thirty-day mourning period.

### Part 3
With regard to the statement of the <i>baraita</i> that the Festival counts toward the thirty-day period of mourning: <b>What, is it not</b> referring to <b>the latter clause</b> of that <i>baraita</i>, which speaks about a case where the burial was performed during the Festival itself? If this is the case, then a refutation of Rava’s opinion is stated explicitly, that the Festival counts toward the thirty-day mourning period, even if the deceased was buried on the Festival itself. Rava rejects this argument: <b>No,</b> it is referring to <b>the first clause,</b> which discusses a case where the burial was performed before the Festival, and since rites of mourning were observed already before the Festival, the Festival is counted toward the thirty-day period of mourning. Therefore, it is not a refutation of Rava’s <i>halakha</i>.

### Part 4
Abaye <b>raised an objection to</b> Rava’s opinion from another <i>baraita</i>, in which it was taught: <b>A pilgrimage Festival counts toward the thirty-</b>day period of mourning. <b>How so?</b> If one <b>buried</b> his dead relative <b>at the beginning of a pilgrimage Festival, he must count seven</b> days of mourning <b>after the Festival, and</b> during this period <b>his work is performed by others. And his menservants and maidservants perform</b> this work <b>in private inside his house, and the public need not occupy themselves with him</b> and come to console him, <b>for they already occupied themselves with him during the Festival. And the Festival counts for him.</b> Here it is explicitly stated that the Festival counts toward the thirty-day period of mourning, even when the deceased was buried during the Festival itself. The Gemara concludes: This is indeed <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of Rava’s opinion.

### Part 5
<b>When Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Even</b> if <b>one buried</b> his dead relative <b>during the Festival,</b> the Festival counts toward his thirty-day period of mourning. <b>And, similarly, Rabbi Elazar ruled for Rabbi Pedat, his son: Even if one buried</b> his dead relative <b>during the Festival</b> it counts towards his thirty days.

### Part 6
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one fulfilled the</b> obligation of <b>overturning the bed for three days before the pilgrimage Festival, he is no</b> longer <b>required to overturn it after the Festival;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. But the Rabbis say: Even</b> if one overturned his bed for only <b>one day, or even for</b> only <b>one hour,</b> he is not required to overturn it after the Festival.

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, said: This is the statement of Beit Shammai,</b> and <b>that is the statement of Beit Hillel.</b> In other words, Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis disagreed about a matter that was the subject of an earlier dispute between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, <b>for Beit Shammai say: Three days, and Beit Hillel say: Even one day.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said, and some say</b> a different version of this line of transmission: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba and to Rav Huna: Even one day, even one hour.</b> The Gemara cites <b>Rava,</b> who <b>said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the <i>tanna</i></b> of <b>our</b> mishna, who <b>said three</b> days. Based on this, we rule that the mourning rites are not canceled after the Festival unless they were observed for at least three days before the Festival.

### Part 9
<b>Ravina happened</b> to come to the city of <b>Sura on the</b> banks of the <b>Euphrates</b> River. <b>Rav Ḥaviva said to Ravina: What is</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> with regard to this issue? <b>He said to him: Even one day, and even one hour.</b>

### Part 10
§ It was related that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, Rabbi Ami, and Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa were</b> once <b>sitting in the pavilion of Rabbi Yitzḥak ben Elazar</b> and were conversing. <b>A matter emerged from among them: From where</b> is it derived that the rites of <b>mourning</b> are observed for <b>seven</b> days? <b>As it is written: “And I will turn your Festivals into mourning”</b> (Amos 8:10). <b>Just as a Festival</b> lasts for <b>seven</b> days, <b>so too mourning</b> lasts for <b>seven</b> days.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>And say</b> that perhaps mourning is like <b><i>Shavuot</i>, which is</b> only <b>one day.</b> The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>That</b> derivation, from the one day of <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>is required for</b> what was stated by <b>Reish Lakish, as Reish Lakish said in the name of Rabbi Yehuda Nesia: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> mourning in the case of <b>distant tidings,</b> i.e., when one hears that one of his relatives died a long time ago, <b>applies for only one day? As it is written: “And I will turn your Festivals into mourning,” and we find</b> with regard to <b><i>Shavuot</i> that one day is</b> also <b>called a Festival.</b>

### Part 12
<b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>recent tidings</b> of a relative’s death, mourning <b>applies for seven- and thirty-</b>day periods. In the case of <b>distant tidings, it applies only for one day. What are</b> considered <b>recent tidings and what are</b> considered <b>distant tidings? Recent</b> tidings are news that arrives <b>within thirty</b> days of the person’s death. <b>Distant</b> tidings are news that arrives <b>after thirty</b> days; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. And the Rabbis say: Both</b> in the case of <b>recent tidings and</b> in the case of <b>distant tidings,</b> mourning <b>applies for seven- and thirty-</b>day periods.

### Part 13
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Wherever you find an individual being lenient and the majority being stringent, the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the majority, except for this</b> case, <b>for even though Rabbi Akiva is lenient and the Rabbis are stringent, the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b> This is in keeping with the principle <b>stated by Shmuel: The <i>halakha</i> follows the statement of the</b> more <b>lenient</b> authority <b>in</b> matters relating to <b>mourning.</b>

### Part 14
It was related that <b>Rav Ḥanina received</b> distant <b>tidings of his father’s</b> death <b>from Bei Ḥozai. He came before Rav Ḥisda</b> to ask what he should do. Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him:</b> In the case of <b>distant tidings,</b> mourning <b>applies for only one day.</b> It was similarly related that <b>Rav Natan bar Ami received a report about his mother’s</b> death <b>from Bei Ḥozai. He came before Rava,</b> and Rava <b>said to him: They said</b> that in the case of <b>distant tidings,</b> mourning <b>applies for only one day.</b>

### Part 15
Rav Natan <b>raised an objection to</b> Rava’s opinion based on what was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement</b> that mourning applies for only one day <b>said?</b> In the case of <b>the</b> other <b>five close relatives,</b> over whose <b>death</b> it is <b>a mitzva</b> to mourn, i.e., son, daughter, brother, sister, and spouse. <b>But for one’s father or mother,</b> one is required to mourn for <b>seven and thirty</b> days, even when the report of the parent’s death is received some time after the event.

### Part 16
Rava <b>said to him:</b> This <b>is an individual</b> opinion, <b>and we do not hold in accordance with his</b> opinion, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident and the father of Rabbi Tzadok died in</b> the city of <b>Ginzak, and they informed him</b> of his father’s passing only <b>after three years. He came and asked Elisha ben Avuya and the Elders with him</b> what he should do. <b>And</b> Elisha ben Avuya <b>said</b> to him: <b>Observe</b> the rites of mourning for <b>seven and thirty</b> days. <b>And when the son of Rabbi Aḥiyya died in the Diaspora,</b> and Rabbi Aḥiyya was informed about his passing a long time afterward, he <b>sat</b> in mourning for <b>seven and thirty</b> days. Therefore, it is clear that this opinion was held only by a few individual Sages, but it was not generally accepted.

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so,</b> that this is Rabbi Aḥiyya’s opinion? <b>But Rav was the son of Rabbi Ḥiyya’s brother and</b> also <b>the son of Rabbi Ḥiyya’s sister,</b> for Rav’s father, Aivu, was Rabbi Ḥiyya’s paternal half brother, and Rav’s mother was Rabbi Ḥiyya’s maternal half sister. <b>When</b> Rav <b>went there,</b> Eretz Yisrael, his uncle Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>said to him: Is</b> your <b>father,</b> Aivu, still <b>alive?</b>
