### Part 1
<b>so too, the words of Torah,</b> which are “the work of the hands of an artist,” i.e., God, must remain <b>hidden</b> in the study hall.

### Part 2
Despite Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s decree, <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya went out and taught his two nephews, Rav and Rabba bar bar Ḥana, in the marketplace. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>heard</b> what he had done and <b>became angry</b> with him. When <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya came</b> at some later date <b>to visit him,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi mockingly <b>said to him: Iyya, who is calling you outside?</b> By asking this question Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi was intimating that Rabbi Ḥiyya should leave his house. Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>understood that</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>had taken the matter to heart</b> and was insulted, and so <b>he conducted</b> himself as if he had been <b>admonished,</b> as a self-imposed punishment, <b>for thirty days.</b>

### Part 3
<b>On the thirtieth day,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>sent him</b> a message, saying: <b>Come</b> and visit me. However, <b>he later</b> reversed his opinion and <b>sent him</b> another message, telling him <b>not to come.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>At the outset what did he hold, and ultimately what did he hold? Initially,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>held that</b> the legal status of <b>part of the day is like</b> that <b>of an entire</b> day, and since the thirtieth day already begun, Rabbi Ḥiyya’s time of admonition had ended. <b>But ultimately he held</b> that with regard to this issue <b>we do not say</b> that the legal status of <b>part of the day is like</b> that <b>of an entire</b> day.

### Part 5
<b>In the end</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>came</b> on that same day. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>asked him: Why have you come?</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>responded: Because</b> you, <b>Master, sent</b> me a message that <b>I should come.</b> He said to him: <b>But I sent</b> you a second message <b>that you should not come. He responded: This</b> messenger that you sent, i.e., the first one, <b>I saw</b> him and I did as he said, <b>but that</b> messenger, i.e., the second one, <b>I did not see.</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>read</b> the verse <b>about</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya: <b>“When a man’s ways please the Lord, He makes even his enemies to be at peace with him”</b> (Proverbs 16:7), as it was clear to him that Rabbi Ḥiyya had merited divine assistance.

### Part 6
§ Concerning the issue with which the entire incident had begun, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi asked Rabbi Ḥiyya: <b>What is the reason that</b> you, <b>the Master, acted as</b> you did, ignoring my instructions not to teach Torah in the marketplace? Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>said to him: As it is written: “Wisdom cries aloud in the streets”</b> (Proverbs 1:20), which implies that Torah should be publicized in the streets. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him: If you read</b> this verse once, <b>you</b> certainly <b>did not read</b> it <b>a second time</b> in greater depth; <b>and if you read</b> it <b>a second time, you</b> certainly <b>did not read</b> it <b>a third time;</b> and <b>if you read</b> it <b>a third time,</b> then <b>it was not</b> adequately <b>explained to you,</b> as it is clear that you do not understand it properly.

### Part 7
The words: <b>“Wisdom cries aloud in the streets,”</b> should be understood <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava. As Rava said:</b> With regard to <b>everyone who occupies himself with Torah</b> study <b>inside</b> the privacy of his home, <b>his Torah</b> knowledge <b>will proclaim his</b> greatness <b>outside,</b> as it will be revealed to the masses and they will see his greatness.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written: “From the beginning I have not spoken in secret”</b> (Isaiah 48:16), implying that the Torah should be taught and proclaimed in public? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse is referring to <b>the days of the <i>kalla</i>,</b> the gathering for Torah study held during Elul and Adar, when many people come to listen to Torah discourses. During this time, it is not only permitted but even recommended to teach Torah to the masses. In this way, the verse can be explained in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>And what did Rabbi Ḥiyya do with this</b> verse: <b>“Your rounded thighs are like jewels”?</b> How did he understand it? This verse implies that the Torah must be kept hidden in the study hall and not publicized in the marketplace. The Gemara explains: <b>He interprets it</b> not as a reference to Torah, but as referring <b>to</b> acts of <b>charity and loving-kindness,</b> which should certainly be performed in private.

### Part 10
This incident demonstrates <b>that, apparently, admonition of those</b> who live in Eretz Yisrael lasts for <b>thirty days</b> and not for seven days. The Gemara answers that this is not a conclusive proof, since Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi was the <i>Nasi</i>. <b>The admonition of the <i>Nasi</i></b> of the Sanhedrin <b>is different</b> i.e., more severe, than the admonition of anyone else.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>And how</b> long <b>is our admonition</b> in Babylonia? The Gemara answers: It is only <b>one day, as in</b> the case involving <b>Shmuel and</b> the Exilarch <b>Mar Ukva. When they would sit and study <i>halakha</i>, Mar Ukva would sit before Shmuel at a distance of four cubits</b> as a sign of respect. Mar Ukva would conduct himself as though Shmuel were his teacher because Shmuel was much greater than him in Torah matters. <b>And when they would sit</b> together <b>in judgment, Shmuel would sit before Mar Ukva at a distance of four cubits</b> because Mar Ukva was the Exilarch and the chief judge. <b>But they would lower a place for Mar Ukva in the matting</b> upon which he sat, <b>and he would sit on it so that he could hear</b> Shmuel’s <b>words</b> of Torah even when they were engaged in judgment.

### Part 12
<b>Every day, Mar Ukva would accompany Shmuel to his lodgings,</b> in the manner that a student would show honor toward his teacher. <b>One day,</b> Mar Ukva <b>was</b> so heavily <b>preoccupied with a case</b> that had been brought before him for judgment that he did not realize that <b>Shmuel was walking behind him</b> to show him respect due to his position as the Exilarch. <b>When</b> Mar Ukva <b>reached his home,</b> Shmuel <b>said to him: Is it not enough for you</b> that I accompanied you until here? <b>Release me, Master, from my obligation,</b> so that I may return home. Mar Ukva <b>understood that</b> Shmuel <b>had taken the matter to heart</b> and was insulted. Therefore, <b>he conducted</b> himself as if he had been <b>admonished, for one day</b> as a self-imposed punishment.

### Part 13
It was related that <b>a certain woman was sitting alongside a path</b> with <b>her leg extended</b> while <b>she was sifting barley. A Torah scholar passed</b> by her on this path, <b>but she did not yield to him</b> and move her leg to make room for him. <b>He said: How rude is that woman!</b> The woman <b>came before Rav Naḥman</b> to ask if this statement should be deemed as excommunication. <b>He said to her: Did you hear</b> the word <b>excommunication</b> explicitly issue <b>from his mouth? She said to him: No. He said to her:</b> If this is the case, then <b>go and observe an admonition for one day,</b> as it appears that the Torah scholar sought only to admonish you.

### Part 14
§ <b>Zutra bar Toviyya was</b> once <b>reading the portion</b> of the Bible <b>before Rav Yehuda. When he reached the verse: “Now these are the last words of David”</b> (II Samuel 23:1), Zutra bar Toviyya <b>said to</b> Rav Yehuda: If it is written that these are the <b>last</b> of David’s words, <b>by inference there are first</b> words as well. If this is the case, <b>what are these first</b> words of David? Prior to this, it mentions only David’s song, but not his words.

### Part 15
Rav Yehuda <b>remained silent and said nothing to him.</b> Zutra bar Toviyya thought that Rav Yehuda did not hear what he had said, so he <b>then said to him</b> a second time: If it is written that these are the <b>last</b> of David’s words, <b>by inference there are first</b> words as well. If this is the case, <b>what are these first</b> words of David? <b>He said to him: What do you think?</b> Do you think that anyone <b>who does not know the meaning of this verse is not a great man?</b> Why are you stressing the fact that I do not know the answer to your question? Zutra bar Toviyya <b>understood that</b> Rav Yehuda <b>had taken the matter to heart</b> and was insulted. Therefore, <b>he conducted</b> himself as if had been <b>admonished for one day</b> as a self-imposed punishment.

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> now <b>that we have come</b> to discuss this issue, since the verse mentions David’s <b>last</b> words, <b>by inference there are</b> also <b>first</b> words. <b>What</b> then <b>are these first</b> words of David? The Gemara answers: The first words are: <b>“And David spoke to the Lord the words of this song in the day that the Lord delivered him out of the hand of his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul”</b> (II Samuel 22:1), as that song is also referred to as words.

### Part 17
The Gemara elaborates: <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to David: David, do you recite a song over the fall of Saul? Had you been Saul and he were David,</b> then <b>I would have destroyed many Davids before him.</b> Although I decreed that Saul’s kingdom would not continue, as an individual he was far greater and more important than you.

### Part 18
The response to this admonishment <b>is</b> found in the verse, <b>as it is written: “Shiggaion of David, which he sang to the Lord, concerning the words of Cush the Benjaminite”</b> (Psalms 7:1). <b>Is Cush his name? Saul is his name. Rather,</b> this is a designation that indicates: <b>Just as a Cushite,</b> a native of the ancient kingdom of Cush in eastern Africa, <b>is distinguished by his</b> dark <b>skin, so too, Saul was distinguished by his actions,</b> as he was absolutely righteous and performed many good deeds. Therefore, David uses the word <i>shiggaion</i> as an allusion to the error [<i>shegia</i>] that he had made when he sang a song of praise over Saul’s downfall.

### Part 19
The Gemara notes: <b>Similarly, you can explain</b> the verse: “And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses <b>due to the Cushite woman whom he had married,</b> for he had taken a Cushite woman” (Numbers 12:1). <b>But is her name Cushite? Zipporah is her name. Rather, just as a Cushite is distinguished by his</b> dark <b>skin, so too, Zipporah was distinguished by her actions.</b> The Gemara continues: <b>Similarly, you can explain</b> the verse: <b>“Now when Ebed-Melech the Cushite heard”</b> (Jeremiah 38:7). <b>Is his name Cushite? Zedekiah is his name. Rather, just as a Cushite is distinguished by his</b> dark <b>skin, so too, Zedekiah was distinguished by his</b> righteous <b>actions.</b>

### Part 20
<b>Similarly, you can explain</b> the verse: <b>“Are you not as much Mine as the children of the Cushites, O children of Israel?”</b> (Amos 9:7). <b>Is their name Cushite? Israel is their name. Rather, just as a Cushite stands out</b> because of <b>his</b> dark <b>skin, so too, the Jewish people are distinguished by their actions,</b> and they are different <b>from all the</b> other <b>nations.</b>

### Part 21
§ Having mentioned the last words of David, the Gemara continues to explain other expressions in that passage. <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said in the name of Rabbi Yonatan: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “The saying of David, son of Yishai, and the saying of the man who was raised up on high [<i>al</i> ]”</b> (II Samuel 23:1)? It means as follows: <b>The saying of David, son of Yishai, who raised the yoke of [<i>ulla</i>] repentance,</b> as through his actions he taught the power of repentance. The word <i>al</i>, on high, and the word <i>ulla</i> are comprised of the same consonants in Hebrew.

### Part 22
The passage continues: <b>“The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spoke to me, He that rules over men must be righteous, ruling in the fear of God”</b> (II Samuel 23:3). The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> this verse <b>saying?</b> What does it mean? <b>Rabbi Abbahu said: This is what</b> the verse <b>is saying: The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spoke to me:</b> Although <b>I rule over man, who rules over Me?</b> It is <b>a righteous person.</b> How is it possible to say that a righteous person rules over God, as it were? <b>As I,</b> God, <b>issue a decree</b> and the righteous person <b>nullifies it.</b>

### Part 23
Similarly, the verse states there: <b>“These are the names of David’s warriors; Josheb-Basshebeth</b> a Tahchemonite, chief of the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite; he raised his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time” (II Samuel 23:8). The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> this verse <b>saying? Rabbi Abbahu said: This is what</b> the verse <b>is saying: These are the names of the mighty actions of David.</b> These expressions should not be read as names of people but instead as descriptions of David’s good deeds.

### Part 24
<b>Josheb-Basshebeth [<i>yoshev bashevet</i>]</b> indicates that <b>when</b> David <b>would sit [<i>yoshev</i>] in the study hall, he would not sit upon pillows and cushions,</b> as an important person ordinarily would. <b>Rather,</b> he would sit <b>on the ground</b> like one of the students. <b>For as long as</b> David’s <b>teacher, Ira the Jairite, was alive,</b> Ira <b>would teach the Sages</b> while sitting <b>on pillows and cushions. When</b> Ira <b>passed away, David would teach the Sages, and he</b> did this while <b>sitting on the ground. They said to him: Master,</b> you <b>should sit upon pillows and blankets. He did not accept</b> their suggestions, since in his humility he did not wish to appear as the teacher of the Jewish people.

### Part 25
In this verse, David is described as <b>“a Tahchemonite [<i>taḥkemoni</i>].” Rav said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to him: Since you have humbled yourself, be you</b> now <b>like Me [<i>tehe kamoni</i>].</b> How so? <b>As I issue a decree, and you,</b> owing to your righteousness, <b>may nullify it.</b>

### Part 26
David is also described here as <b>“chief of the captains [<i>rosh hashalishim</i>]”</b> because God said to him: <b>You will be the head [<i>rosh</i>] of the three [<i>sheloshet</i>] Patriarchs. “The same was Adino the Eznite”;</b> this alludes to the fact that <b>when</b> David <b>would sit and occupy himself with Torah, he would make himself soft [<i>me’aden</i>] as a worm, and when he would go out to war, he would make himself hard</b> and strong <b>as a tree [<i>etz</i>].</b>

### Part 27
The expression: <b>“Against eight hundred people, which he slew at one time,”</b> means <b>that he would throw an arrow</b> in the air <b>and</b> with it <b>kill eight hundred people at one time. And</b> David <b>would sigh over the two hundred</b> who were missing from fulfillment of the Torah’s promise, <b>as it is written: “How should one man chase a thousand”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:30).

### Part 28
<b>A Divine Voice issued forth and said</b> by way of explanation as to why the promise was not entirely fulfilled: “Because David did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, and turned not aside from anything that He commanded him all the days of his life, <b>save only the matter of Uriah the Hittite”</b> (I Kings 15:5). Had David not committed this sin, then all of the promises mentioned in the Torah would have been fulfilled in their entirety through him.

### Part 29
The Gemara returns to the <i>halakhot</i> of ostracism and mentions that <b>Rabbi Tanḥum, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, of the village of Akko, said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Aḥa said</b> that <b>Rabbi Simlai said, and</b> some <b>say</b> that this tradition was transmitted in the following manner: <b>Rabbi Tanḥum said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said, and</b> others <b>say</b> that <b>Rav Huna himself</b> made this statement without the chain of transmission:
