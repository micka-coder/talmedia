### Part 1
<b>However,</b> with regard to the hooves of <b>a donkey</b> that turns the <b>millstones, no,</b> they may not be trimmed. This is unnecessary on the intermediate days of a Festival, as one may only grind grain that one needs to use on the Festival itself, and the donkey can perform this task even if its hooves are not trimmed.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Yehuda permits</b> one <b>to trim the hooves of the donkey</b> that turns <b>a mill, to set</b> the stones of <b>a mill</b> in their place, <b>to build</b> the base of <b>a mill, to construct</b> a water <b>channel</b> to carry water that drives <b>a mill, and to build a stable</b> for horses on the intermediate days of a Festival. <b>Rava permitted</b> one <b>to groom a horse, to build a trough, and to build a bench</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival.

### Part 3
<b>Rava</b> also <b>permitted</b> one <b>to let the blood of an animal</b> for medical purposes <b>on the intermediate days of a Festival. Abaye said to him:</b> A <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught that supports you: One may let blood from an animal, and one</b> does <b>not withhold</b> any <b>medical treatment from an animal on the intermediate days of a Festival.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rava</b> further <b>permitted</b> one <b>to scrub garments</b> as part of the laundry process. <b>What is the reason? It is the work of a layman</b> and not the work of a craftsman, which is prohibited on the intermediate days of a Festival. <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Ami said that Rav Ḥisda said: Tying sleeves</b> to create pleats <b>is prohibited. What is the reason? It is the work of a craftsman</b> and is consequently prohibited on the intermediate days of a Festival.

### Part 5
§ <b>Rava said:</b> With regard to one <b>who clears the ground</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival, the following distinction applies: If <b>his intention</b> is to prepare <b>a threshing floor, it is permitted,</b> but if <b>his intention</b> is to prepare <b>the ground</b> for planting, <b>it is prohibited.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of each case? The Gemara explains: If he casts earth from one <b>mound [<i>mulya</i>] onto</b> another <b>mound, or</b> from <b>one furrow into</b> another <b>furrow [<i>natza</i>],</b> it is clear that he is doing this <b>with the intention of</b> preparing <b>a threshing floor,</b> as his sole interest is the level area in the middle and not the ground that surrounds it. However, if <b>he takes</b> earth <b>from a mound and casts it into a furrow,</b> he is presumably doing this <b>with the intention of</b> preparing <b>the ground</b> for planting, which is prohibited on the intermediate days of a Festival due to its similarity to the prohibited labor of plowing.

### Part 7
<b>And Rava said:</b> With regard to <b>one who clears</b> his field from <b>twigs</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival, the following distinction applies: If <b>his intention</b> is to use <b>the twigs it is permitted,</b> but if <b>his intention</b> is to prepare <b>the ground</b> for planting, <b>it is prohibited.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of each case? The Gemara explains: If <b>he takes the large</b> twigs <b>and leaves the small</b> ones, it is clear that he is doing this <b>with the intention of</b> using <b>the twigs.</b> But if <b>he takes</b> both <b>the large</b> twigs <b>and the small</b> ones, it appears as though that he is doing so <b>with the intention of</b> preparing <b>the ground,</b> and it is prohibited.

### Part 8
<b>And Rava</b> further <b>said:</b> With regard to <b>one who opens the</b> gates of <b>a water</b> channel running <b>through his land</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival,the following distinction applies: If <b>his intention</b> is to catch <b>the fish</b> that come along with the water, <b>it is permitted,</b> but if <b>his intention</b> is to water <b>the ground, it is prohibited.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of each case? The Gemara explains: If <b>he opens two gates</b> in the water channel, <b>one above</b> his field <b>and one below,</b> so the water that flows in also flows out, it is clear that he is doing this <b>with the intention of</b> catching <b>fish,</b> as the water will flow out and only the fish will remain in the indentations in his field. But if <b>he opens</b> only <b>one</b> gate, he is presumably doing this <b>with the intention of</b> watering <b>the ground,</b> as it is evident that he wants the channel to fill and the water to overflow into the field.

### Part 10
<b>And Rava</b> also <b>said:</b> With regard to <b>one who cuts</b> the branches of his <b>date palm</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival, the following distinction applies: If he does this <b>with the intention of</b> feeding <b>his animals, it is permitted,</b> but if he does it <b>with the intention of</b> enhancing the growth of his <b>date palm, it is prohibited.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of each case? The Gemara explains: If <b>he takes all</b> of the branches <b>from one side</b> of the tree, he is doing this <b>with the intention of</b> feeding the branches to <b>his animals,</b> as it is evident that he is not concerned with the damage to the date palm. However, if he takes the branches <b>from this side</b> of the tree <b>and</b> also <b>from the other side,</b> it appears as though he is doing so <b>with the intention of</b> enhancing the growth of <b>the date palm, and it is prohibited.</b>

### Part 11
<b>And Rava</b> further <b>said: With regard to these unripe dates, cutting them</b> into pieces in order to render them fit for eating <b>is permitted</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival, but <b>preserving them is prohibited,</b>as they will not be ready for use until after the Festival. <b>Rav Pappa said: Since they</b> are likely to <b>become infested with worms</b> if they are not properly attended to, <b>they are</b> treated <b>like merchandise that will be lost, and it is permitted</b> to preserve them on the intermediate days of a Festival.

### Part 12
§ <b>And Rava</b> also <b>said: Any commerce is prohibited</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival. <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Avin said: But</b> with regard to <b>a matter that,</b> if left unattended, will result in significant <b>loss, it is permitted.</b> The Gemara relates that <b>Ravina</b> once <b>had a</b> joint <b>business</b> venture <b>that could have been sold for six thousand</b> dinars, but <b>he delayed selling it</b> until <b>after the intermediate days of a Festival, and he sold it</b> then <b>for twelve thousand</b> dinars.

### Part 13
It is further related that <b>Ravina had lent money to the residents of the fortress of Shanvata. He came before Rav Ashi</b> and <b>said to him: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to going to them now,</b> on the intermediate days of the Festival, to collect my debt? Rav Ashi <b>said to him: Since it is now that you will find them,</b> whereas <b>on other days you will not find them,</b> as during the year these people would travel from place to place to earn their livelihood, <b>this is</b> treated <b>like merchandise that will be lost, and it is</b> therefore <b>permitted.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara adds: <b>So too, it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to idol worship like this case: One may go</b>
