### Part 1
<b>on a plain bier</b> made from poles that were strapped together, <b>and the poor were embarrassed.</b> The Sages <b>instituted that everyone should be taken out</b> for burial <b>on a plain bier, due to the honor of the poor.</b>

### Part 2
Similarly, <b>at first they would place incense under</b> the beds of <b>those who died with an intestinal disease,</b> because the body emitted an especially unpleasant odor. <b>And those who were alive with an intestinal disease were embarrassed</b> when they understood that they, too, would be treated in this manner after their death, and that everyone would know the cause of their death. The Sages <b>instituted that incense should be placed under everyone, due to the honor of those with an intestinal disease who were</b> still <b>living.</b>

### Part 3
Moreover, <b>at first they would</b> ritually <b>immerse</b> all <b>the utensils</b> that had been used <b>by</b> women who <b>died</b> while <b>menstruating,</b> which had thereby contracted ritual impurity. <b>And</b> due to this, <b>the living menstruating women were embarrassed.</b> The Sages <b>instituted that</b> the utensils that had been used <b>by all</b> dying <b>women must be immersed, due to the honor of living menstruating women.</b> And, <b>at first they would</b> ritually <b>immerse</b> all <b>the utensils</b> that had been used by <b><i>zavin</i>,</b> men suffering from gonorrhea, <b>who died,</b> as the utensils had thereby contracted ritual impurity. <b>And</b> due to this <b>the living <i>zavin</i> felt embarrassed.</b> The Sages <b>instituted that</b> the utensils that had been used <b>by all</b> men <b>must be immersed, due to the honor of the living <i>zavin</i>.</b>

### Part 4
Likewise, <b>at first taking the dead out</b> for burial <b>was more difficult for the relatives than the</b> actual <b>death,</b> because it was customary to bury the dead in expensive shrouds, which the poor could not afford. The problem grew <b>to the point that relatives would</b> sometimes <b>abandon</b> the corpse <b>and run away.</b> This lasted <b>until Rabban Gamliel came and acted</b> with <b>frivolity,</b> meaning that he waived his dignity, by leaving instructions that he be <b>taken out</b> for burial <b>in linen garments. And the people</b> adopted this <b>practice after him</b> and had themselves <b>taken out</b> for burial <b>in linen garments. Rav Pappa said: And nowadays, everyone follows the practice</b> of taking out the dead for burial <b>even in</b> plain <b>hemp garments [<i>tzerada</i>]</b> that cost only <b>a dinar.</b>

### Part 5
It is taught in the mishna: <b>The bier</b> of the deceased <b>is not set down in the street</b> during the intermediate days of a Festival, <b>so as not to encourage eulogies. Rav Pappa said:</b> There are <b>no</b> restrictions on eulogizing on the intermediate days of <b>a Festival in the presence</b> of a deceased <b>Torah scholar,</b> and therefore he may be eulogized in the ordinary manner during the Festival week. <b>And all the more so</b> a Torah scholar may be eulogized on the days of <b>Hanukkah and Purim,</b> which have less sanctity than the intermediate days of a Festival.

### Part 6
The Gemara comments: <b>But this</b> allowance to eulogize a Torah scholar during the intermediate days of a Festival <b>applies only</b> when the eulogy is <b>in</b> the <b>presence</b> of the deceased, before the bier. <b>However,</b> giving a eulogy that is <b>not in his presence</b> is <b>not</b> permitted. The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rav Kahana eulogize Rav Zevid from Neharde’a in</b> his city <b>Pum Nahara</b> during the intermediate days of a Festival? <b>Rav Pappa said: It was the day</b> on which Rav Kahana received the <b>news</b> of Rav Zevid’s death, <b>and</b> a eulogy in such a situation <b>is considered as</b> if it is <b>in his presence.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara continues its discussion of the <i>halakhot</i> of mourning: <b>Ulla said:</b> Although <i>hesped</i> usually refers to a eulogy, strictly speaking, <b><i>hesped</i></b> is referring to striking oneself <b>on the heart, as it is written: “Striking [<i>sofedim</i>] the breasts”</b> (Isaiah 32:12). The term <b><i>tipuaḥ</i></b> is referring to striking <b>with</b> one <b>hand</b> against the other hand, i.e., clapping. The term <b><i>killus</i></b> is referring to stomping <b>with</b> one’s <b>foot</b> on the ground.

### Part 8
<b>The Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who stomps his foot on the ground</b> as a sign of mourning <b>should not stomp with a sandal, but rather</b> he should do so wearing <b>a shoe, due to the danger</b> of being hurt. Because a sandal is easily torn, it is possible that something sharp on the ground will puncture his foot, or that he will suffer some other injury.

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Once a mourner nods his head</b> to show that his grief has slightly diminished, <b>the consolers may no longer sit next to him,</b> as with his action the mourner shows that he no longer desires their presence.

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan further said: All are obligated to stand</b> in the <b>presence of the <i>Nasi</i>, except for a mourner and one who is sick. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: To all</b> who stand before a great person <b>one says: Be seated,</b> and only then may they sit down, <b>except for a mourner and one who is sick.</b> If they stood up they do not need permission to sit down, but rather they may do so if they wish.

### Part 11
<b>Rav Yehuda said in the name of Rav: A mourner</b> on the <b>first day</b> of his mourning <b>is prohibited from eating of his own bread.</b> From where is this derived? <b>From</b> what <b>the Merciful One says to Ezekiel</b> when the latter is in mourning: <b>“Nor eat the bread of men”</b> (Ezekiel 24:17), which indicates that other mourners must eat bread made by others. It was related that when <b>Rabba and Rav Yosef</b> were in mourning they <b>would exchange their meals with each other.</b>

### Part 12
<b>And Rav Yehuda said in the name of Rav:</b> When a person <b>dies in a city, all of the residents of that city are prohibited from performing work</b> until he has been buried.

### Part 13
The Gemara relates that when <b>Rav Hamnuna</b> once <b>happened</b> to come to a place called <b>Darumata he heard the sound of a <i>shofar</i></b> announcing that a person <b>had died</b> in the town. When <b>he saw some people doing work he said to them: Let these people be under an excommunication. Is there not a dead</b> person <b>in town? They said to him: There are</b> separate <b>groups in the town,</b> each one responsible for its own dead. Knowing that the deceased was not from our group, we continued our work. <b>He said to them: If so, it is permitted</b> to you, and he revoked his excommunication.

### Part 14
<b>And Rav Yehuda said further in the name of Rav: Anyone who grieves excessively over his dead</b> and does not allow himself to be consoled <b>will</b> in the end <b>weep for another</b> person. The Gemara relates that <b>a certain woman</b> who lived <b>in the neighborhood of Rav Huna had seven sons. One of them died and she wept for him excessively. Rav Huna sent</b> a message <b>to her: Do not do this.</b> But <b>she took no heed of him. He</b> then <b>sent</b> another message <b>to her: If you listen to me, it is well, but if not, prepare shrouds for another death.</b> But she would not listen <b>and they all died. In the end,</b> when she continued with her excessive mourning, <b>he said to her:</b> Since you are acting in this way, <b>prepare shrouds for yourself, and</b> soon thereafter <b>she died.</b>

### Part 15
The Sages taught in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse that states: <b>“Weep not for the dead, neither bemoan him”</b> (Jeremiah 22:10): <b>“Weep not for the dead”</b> is referring to <b>excessive</b> mourning; <b>“neither bemoan him” more than the</b> appropriate <b>measure</b> of time. <b>How so?</b> What is the appropriate measure? <b>Three days for weeping, and seven for eulogizing, and thirty for</b> the prohibition against <b>ironing</b> clothing <b>and for</b> the prohibition against <b>cutting hair. From this</b> point <b>forward the Holy One, Blessed be He, says: Do not be more merciful with</b> the deceased <b>than I am.</b> If the Torah commands one to mourn for a certain period of time, then that suffices.

### Part 16
It is stated in the continuation of the verse: <b>“Weep sore for him that goes away.” Rav Yehuda said:</b> This is referring <b>to one who leaves</b> the world <b>without children</b> to survive him, since mourning for him is much more intense. It was related that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> would <b>go to a house of mourning only for one who passed away without children, as it is written: “Weep sore for him that goes away; for he shall return [<i>yashuv</i>] no more, nor see his native land”</b> (Jeremiah 22:10). <b>Rav Huna</b> disagreed with the interpretation of the verse and <b>said:</b> “Him that goes” <b>is</b> one <b>who committed a transgression and</b> then <b>repeated it,</b> i.e., one who sins constantly and does not repent [<i>yashav</i>], and therefore loses his portion in the World-to-Come, his “native land.”

### Part 17
The Gemara notes that <b>Rav Huna</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning,</b> as <b>Rav Huna said: Once a person commits a transgression and repeats it, it becomes permitted to him.</b> The Gemara questions the wording used here: <b>Does it enter your mind</b> that it is actually <b>permitted?</b> How could it possibly be permitted for him to sin? <b>Rather, say</b> instead: <b>It becomes as though it were permitted,</b> for after doing it twice he no longer relates to his action as the violation of a serious prohibition.

### Part 18
<b>Rabbi Levi said: A mourner</b> during <b>the first three days</b> of his mourning <b>should see himself as though a sword were lying between his two thighs,</b> meaning that he too may be facing imminent death. During this period he should live in dread. <b>From the third to the seventh</b> days he should conduct himself <b>as if</b> the sword <b>were lying opposite him in the corner,</b> but still threatening him. <b>From this</b> point <b>forward it is as if</b> the sword <b>was moving before him in the marketplace,</b> and the fear is not as great.

### Part 19
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> the biers <b>of women</b> are <b>never</b> set down, <b>due to</b> their <b>honor.</b> The Sages of <b>Neharde’a say: They only taught</b> this
