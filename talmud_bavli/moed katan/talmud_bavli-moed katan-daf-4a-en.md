### Part 1
<b>that entered into the Sabbatical Year,</b> i.e., plowing in the sixth year that will benefit crops growing in the seventh year, <b>and reaping</b> the crops <b>of the Sabbatical Year that continued into the conclusion of the Sabbatical Year,</b> i.e., reaping seventh-year produce that continued to grow into the eighth year.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Yishmael says</b> that this verse is to be understood as referring to Shabbat and not to the Sabbatical Year, in accordance with the straightforward meaning of the verse. It teaches as follows: <b>Just as</b> only <b>optional plowing</b> is prohibited on Shabbat, as there is no instance where plowing fulfills a biblical mitzva, <b>so too,</b> only <b>optional reaping</b> is prohibited, <b>to the exclusion of the reaping of the <i>omer</i></b> offering, <b>which is a mitzva,</b> and consequently permitted on Shabbat. Nonetheless, the first opinion cited in the <i>baraita</i>, that of Rabbi Akiva, holds that the prohibition against plowing on the eve of the Sabbatical Year is derived from an explicit verse.

### Part 3
<b>Rather, Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: When we learned</b> this as <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai, <b>it was to permit</b> plowing in the case of <b>young</b> saplings until Rosh HaShana. In contrast, <b>the verses</b> that were cited come <b>to prohibit</b> plowing in the case of <b>mature</b> and well-rooted trees thirty days before Rosh HaShana of the Sabbatical Year.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>But since the <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai comes <b>to permit</b> plowing in the case of <b>young</b> saplings until Rosh HaShana, <b>does it not automatically</b> follow that in the case of <b>mature</b> trees, plowing <b>is prohibited</b> before Rosh HaShana? Therefore, not only the allowance, but the prohibition as well was learned by tradition as a <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai, and not from the verses.

### Part 5
<b>Rather,</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai is the basis of the prohibition against plowing on the eve of the Sabbatical Year <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> who interprets the verse as referring to Shabbat, and not to the Sabbatical Year, whereas <b>the verses</b> are the basis of the prohibition <b>according to the</b> opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara previously cited Rabbi Yitzḥak, who explained how Rabban Gamliel’s court nullified the extension to the prohibition against plowing before the Sabbatical Year that had been enacted by Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel. The Gemara now cites another opinion, which holds that Rabban Gamliel’s court abolished the prohibition against plowing before the Sabbatical Year entirely. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that <b>Rabban Gamliel and his court nullified</b> the restrictions on working the land on the eve of the Sabbatical Year <b>based on</b> a source written <b>in the Torah.</b>

### Part 7
<b>What is the reason? He derives</b> it by means of a verbal analogy between the word <b>Shabbat</b> stated with regard to the Sabbatical Year in the verse: “But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land” (Leviticus 25:4), <b>and</b> the word <b>Shabbat</b> stated with regard to the weekly Shabbat, which commemorates <b>the Shabbat of Creation. Just as there,</b> on Shabbat <b>itself it is prohibited</b> to perform labor, but <b>before and after</b> Shabbat <b>it is permitted, so too here,</b> in the case of the Sabbatical Year, during the Sabbatical Year <b>itself it is prohibited</b> to perform labor, but <b>before and after</b> the Sabbatical Year <b>it is permitted.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rav Ashi strongly objects to this:</b> If Rabban Gamliel and his court nullified the restrictions based on a verbal analogy, then according to <b>the one who said</b> that the prohibition against plowing thirty days before Rosh HaShana of the Sabbatical Year is a <b><i>halakha</i></b> that was transmitted to Moses from Sinai, <b>can a verbal analogy come</b> and <b>uproot a <i>halakha</i></b> that was transmitted to Moses from Sinai? <b>And</b> similarly, according to <b>the one who said</b> that the prohibition against plowing is derived from <b>a verse, can a verbal analogy come</b> and <b>uproot a verse?</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rather, Rav Ashi said: Rabban Gamliel and his court held in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, who said</b> that <b>they learned this</b> prohibition as <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai. <b>But they learned this <i>halakha</i></b> only with regard to the time period <b>when the Temple is standing.</b> This is evidenced by the fact that it is <b>similar to</b> the other <i>halakha</i> stated along with it, that of the <b>water libation,</b> which was part of the service in the Temple. <b>But when the Temple is not standing</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>does not</b> apply, and therefore Rabban Gamliel and his court nullified the prohibition after the destruction of the Temple.

### Part 10
§ It was taught in the mishna: <b>However,</b> one <b>may not</b> irrigate a field on the intermediate days of a Festival <b>with rainwater</b> collected in a cistern <b>or with water drawn with a shadoof.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> irrigating a field with <b>water drawn with a shadoof involves excessive effort,</b> and so it is prohibited on the intermediate days of a Festival. <b>But what excessive effort is involved</b> in irrigating a field <b>with rainwater?</b> Rainwater collects on its own and one merely has to channel it to where it is needed.

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Ile’a said that</b> Rabbi <b>Yoḥanan said:</b> A rabbinic <b>decree</b> was enacted with regard to <b>rainwater due to</b> its similarity <b>to water drawn with a shadoof. Rav Ashi said: Rainwater itself will come to be</b> like <b>water drawn with a shadoof.</b> Once the level of the collected rainwater drops, it will become necessary to draw it with a bucket, a procedure involving excessive effort.

### Part 12
The Gemara comments: Rabbi Ile’a and Rav Ashi <b>disagree with regard to</b> the ruling issued by <b>Rabbi Zeira, as Rabbi Zeira said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Yirmeya said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> With regard to <b>streams that draw water from pools</b> of collected water, <b>one is permitted to irrigate</b> his field <b>from them on the intermediate days of a Festival,</b> because the flow of water is steady.

### Part 13
One <b>Sage,</b> Rav Ashi, <b>is of</b> the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Zeira,</b> as he prohibits only irrigating with rainwater, because the supply might come to an end, but he does not prohibit watering from a source whose flow is steady. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>is not of</b> the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Zeira,</b> as he prohibits irrigating with rainwater due to its similarity to water drawn with a shadoof. This applies regardless of whether the level of the rainwater will drop, and therefore Rabbi Yoḥanan would prohibit using collected water even if a stream flows through it and it will not dry up.

### Part 14
After mentioning the statement of Rabbi Zeira in the course of the previous discussion, the Gemara examines <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Rabbi Zeira said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Yirmeya said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> With regard to <b>streams that draw water from pools</b> of water, <b>one is permitted to irrigate</b> his field <b>from them on the intermediate days of a Festival.</b>

### Part 15
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raised an objection to Rabbi Zeira</b> from what is taught in the mishna: <b>However, one may not</b> irrigate a field on the intermediate days of a Festival <b>with rainwater</b> collected in cisterns <b>or with water drawn with a shadoof.</b> This indicates that whenever there is a concern that the water might run out, it is prohibited to irrigate from this water source. Consequently, Rabbi Yirmeya wanted to know why this concern did not exist in the case of the pools of water as well. Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: Yirmeya, my son, these pools in Babylonia are like water that does not stop</b> flowing. Therefore, there is no concern that the water level in these pools might go down to such an extent that it will become necessary to draw the water with buckets.

### Part 16
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>temporary pools and</b> regular <b>pools that were filled with water on the eve of a Festival, it is prohibited for one to irrigate</b> his field <b>from them on the intermediate days of the Festival,</b> lest they run out of water and he will come to exert himself and bring water from elsewhere. <b>But if a water channel passes between them</b> so that water flows from the one to the other, <b>it is permitted.</b>

### Part 17
<b>Rav Pappa said: And this</b> allowance applies only <b>when the majority of that field can be irrigated from that water channel,</b> such that most of the field can be irrigated at the same time. In this case, there is no concern that when the water runs out, he will come to exert himself and irrigate the rest of the field from another source of water. <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> It applies <b>even though the majority of that field cannot be irrigated</b> from that water channel at the same time. <b>Since</b> the channel <b>continuously draws</b> water, constantly replenishing its supply, even if it does so at a slow rate, one will <b>say</b> to himself that even <b>if</b> the entire field <b>cannot be irrigated</b> from that water channel <b>on a single day, it can be irrigated</b> from it <b>over</b> the course of <b>two or three days.</b> Accordingly, he will not find it necessary to exert himself to quickly irrigate that portion of the field that did not already receive its water.

### Part 18
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a pool</b> that receives <b>drips</b> of <b>water from this field that requires irrigation,</b> which itself receives water from a spring, <b>one is permitted to irrigate from</b> this pool <b>another field</b> situated below it <b>that requires irrigation.</b>

### Part 19
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t</b> the pool <b>likely to stop flowing,</b> which will force him to exert himself and draw water from somewhere else? <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said:</b> The case is where the upper field <b>is still trickling</b> water into the pool and does not stop. <b>Abaye said: And this</b> allowance applies only <b>when</b> the water from <b>the first spring</b> that irrigates the upper field <b>has not stopped</b> flowing. Only in that case can one rely on the water trickling from the upper field and consequently irrigating the lower field from the pool.

### Part 20
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya says:</b> With regard to <b>two garden beds</b> located <b>one above the other, one may not draw</b> water <b>from</b> the channel supplying <b>the lower</b> garden bed in order <b>to irrigate the upper</b> garden bed, due to the excessive exertion involved. <b>Furthermore, Rabbi Elazar bar Shimon said: Even</b> in the case of <b>a single garden bed, half of which is lower and half of which is higher, one may not draw</b> water <b>from the</b> channel supplying <b>the lower area to irrigate the upper area,</b> even though they are two parts of the same garden bed.

### Part 21
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may draw</b> water and irrigate <b>vegetables in order to eat them</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival. <b>But if</b> he does this <b>in order</b> to improve their growth and <b>to enhance their</b> appearance <b>it is prohibited,</b> as he is considered to be unnecessarily exerting himself on the Festival.

### Part 22
The Gemara relates that <b>Ravina and Rabba Tosefa’a were</b> once <b>walking along the road</b> when <b>they saw a certain man that was drawing</b> water <b>with a bucket on the intermediate days of a Festival. Rabba Tosefa’a said to Ravina: Let the Master come and excommunicate him</b> for transgressing the words of the Sages. Ravina <b>said to him: But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may draw for vegetables in order to eat them,</b> and so he has not committed a transgression. Rabba Tosefa’a <b>said to him: Do you maintain</b> that <b>what is</b> meant by <b>one may draw</b> [<b><i>madlin</i></b>] <b>is</b> that <b>one may draw water</b> in order to irrigate the vegetables? This is not so. Rather, <b>what is</b> meant by
