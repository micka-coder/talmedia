### Part 1
<b>And if you say</b> that with regard to <b>a baby there is a distinction</b> between being born before the Festival and being born on it, and in some cases it is prohibited to cut the hair of a baby, then <b>you find that mourning</b> is <b>practiced</b> even <b>with a minor.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One rends</b> the clothes of <b>a minor</b> whose relative has passed away, <b>due to</b> the desire to bring about feelings of <b>grief</b> among those who see him? However, there is no inherent requirement for the minor to observe any of the <i>halakhot</i> of mourning.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Ashi said: Is it taught</b> explicitly in the first <i>baraita</i> cited by Rav Pineḥas that if it is prohibited for one to have a haircut during the Festival, <b>it is</b> likewise <b>prohibited</b> to have a haircut during the week of mourning? That was merely an inference. <b>Perhaps there are</b> those <b>among them,</b> i.e., those listed in the mishna, for whom it is <b>prohibited,</b> while <b>there are</b> others <b>among them</b> for whom it is <b>permitted,</b> and the <i>halakhot</i> of mourning do not apply to a baby.

### Part 4
<b>Ameimar, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, taught</b> that statement <b>in this</b> manner. <b>Shmuel said:</b> With regard to <b>a baby, it is permitted to cut his</b> hair <b>during the Festival.</b> It <b>is no different</b> whether <b>he was born during the Festival, and it is no different</b> whether <b>he was born beforehand.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rav Pineḥas said: We, too, learn</b> in the <i>baraita</i> a support for this statement: <b>All of those</b> about <b>whom</b> the Sages <b>said: It is permitted to shave</b> and cut his hair <b>on</b> the intermediate days of the <b>Festival, it is</b> also <b>permitted to shave</b> and cut his hair <b>during the days of his mourning. But</b> from this it follows that <b>one who is prohibited from shaving</b> and cutting his hair <b>on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival is</b> also <b>prohibited from shaving</b> and cutting his hair <b>during the days of his mourning.</b>

### Part 6
<b>If you say</b> that with regard to <b>a baby it is prohibited</b> to cut his hair, then <b>you find that mourning</b> is <b>practiced</b> even <b>with a minor. And it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One rends</b> the clothes of <b>a minor</b> whose relative has passed away <b>due to</b> the desire to bring about feelings of <b>grief</b> among those who see him. However, there is no inherent requirement for the minor to observe any of the <i>halakhot</i> of mourning.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Ashi said: Is it taught</b> explicitly in the first <i>baraita</i> cited by Rav Pineḥas that if it is prohibited for one to shave during the Festival, it is likewise <b>prohibited</b> to shave during the week of mourning? That was merely an inference. <b>Perhaps there are</b> those <b>among them</b> for whom it is <b>prohibited,</b> while <b>there are</b> others <b>among them</b> for whom it is <b>permitted.</b> If so, there is no clear support from this <i>baraita</i> for Shmuel’s statement.

### Part 8
§ <b>A mourner does not practice</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>his mourning on a Festival, as it is stated: “And you shall rejoice in your Festival”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:14).

### Part 9
The Gemara explains: <b>If it is a mourning</b> period that had already begun <b>at the outset</b> of the Festival, <b>the positive mitzva of</b> rejoicing on the Festival, which is incumbent upon <b>the community, comes and overrides the positive mitzva of</b> the <b>individual,</b> i.e., the mourning. <b>And if the mourning</b> period began only <b>now,</b> i.e., the deceased died during the Festival, <b>the positive mitzva of the individual does not come and override the positive mitzva of the community.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>one who was ostracized, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Must he <b>observe the practices of ostracism,</b> or are they overridden by the mitzva to rejoice <b>on the Festival? Rav Yosef said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an answer from that which is taught: During the Festival <b>the court judges</b> cases of <b>capital law,</b> cases of <b>lashes,</b> and cases of <b>monetary law.</b> It is known that <b>if one does not listen to</b> and follow <b>the judgment,</b> among the possibilities of enforcement is that <b>we ostracize him</b> until he accepts the verdict.

### Part 11
<b>And if it enters your mind that one does not observe the practices of ostracism during the Festival,</b> the following <i>a fortiori</i> argument can be made: If, for <b>one who has already been ostracized at the outset</b> of the Festival, <b>the Festival comes and overrides his</b> observance of that status, is it reasonable that <b>now we,</b> the court, should <b>ostracize he</b> who does not listen to the judgment of the court during the Festival itself? Rather, it must be that one does observe the practices of ostracism, even during the Festival.

### Part 12
<b>Abaye said to him:</b> There is no proof from here, <b>as perhaps</b> when the <i>baraita</i> states that the court judges cases, what it meant is that it <b>deliberates in judgment</b> on the Festival, but it does not actually reach a verdict. Therefore, the court never ostracizes someone during the Festival. Accordingly, there is no <i>a fortiori</i> argument proving that one observes the practices of ostracism during the Festival. <b>Because if you do not say so,</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to deliberation, then in the cases of <b>capital law that are taught, here too, would we put someone to death</b> on the Festival?

### Part 13
<b>But</b> if so, the judges <b>would be prevented from rejoicing on the Festival, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Akiva says: From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to the Sanhedrin who put someone to death that they may not taste</b> any food or drink <b>for the entire</b> rest <b>of the day? The verse states: “You shall not eat with the blood”</b> (Leviticus 19:26). It is not appropriate to eat during the same day that they caused bloodshed.

### Part 14
<b>Rather,</b> the statement of the <i>baraita</i>, that the court judges cases of capital law, must be referring <b>to deliberating in judgment</b> and not actually reaching a verdict. <b>Here too,</b> in cases of monetary law and of lashes, it is referring <b>to deliberating in judgment,</b> without the possibility of ostracizing anyone during the Festival. Rav Yosef said <b>to him: If so,</b> if only deliberations are conducted during the Festival, <b>you find a perversion of justice</b> by delaying <b>his</b> verdict.

### Part 15
Rather, the judges <b>come in the morning</b> as usual <b>and deliberate in judgment.</b> They then <b>enter</b> their homes <b>and eat and drink all day,</b> i.e., as much as they desire, in order to rejoice fully on the Festival. <b>Then they come</b> back to the courthouse close to <b>sunset and complete his judgment,</b> i.e., they dispense the verdict, and if necessary, <b>they kill him.</b> In this manner, they are not prevented from enjoying the Festival properly.

### Part 16
<b>Abaye said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another support from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> it is the case with regard to <b>one who is ostracized, that the Sages permitted him</b> to get a haircut during the intermediate days of the Festival. This indicates that one who is ostracized need not observe the practices of ostracism during the Festival.

### Part 17
<b>Rava said: Is it taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>That they permitted it,</b> which would indicate that <b>the Sages</b> permitted all those who were ostracized to cut their hair on the intermediate days of the Festival? Rather, <b>it is taught: They permitted him.</b> This indicates that it is referring to an individual case, <b>where one went and appeased his</b> opposing <b>litigant and the Sages came and released him</b> from his decree of ostracism.

### Part 18
§ The Gemara asks a similar question: With regard to <b>a leper, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Must he <b>observe the practices of his leper status,</b> or are they overridden by the mitzva to rejoice <b>during the Festival? Abaye said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> both <b>the nazirite and the leper</b> who transfers <b>from his</b> state of <b>ritual impurity to his</b> new state of <b>purity</b> may shave on the intermediate days of the Festival. <b>This</b> implies that if <b>during the days of his impurity</b> he must <b>observe</b> all of the ordinary practices, even during the Festival.

### Part 19
The Gemara rejects this proof: The <i>baraita</i> <b>is speaking</b> employing the didactic style of: <b>Needless to say. Needless to say, during the days of his impurity</b> on the Festival, <b>he does not observe</b> the practices of ostracism. <b>However,</b> with regard to one who regains <b>his</b> state of <b>purity</b> during the intermediate days of the Festival, one might think that <b>we should issue a decree</b> that he not be permitted to shave, <b>lest he delay</b> sacrificing <b>his offerings</b> until the last day of the Festival, when it is prohibited to sacrifice offerings of an individual. Perhaps prohibiting him from shaving will prevent this possibility. Therefore, because one might have thought that shaving should be prohibited, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that it is, in fact, permitted for him to shave during the intermediate days of the Festival.

### Part 20
<b>Rava said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another source. The verse states: <b>“And the leper</b> in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent” (Leviticus 13:45). The extra emphasis of the phrase: “And the leper” comes <b>to include the High Priest,</b> teaching that all the <i>halakhot</i> of the leper apply to him. <b>And</b> the status of <b>the High Priest</b> during <b>the entire year is like</b> that of <b>everyone on a Festival, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Horayot</i> 12b): The <b>High Priest sacrifices</b> animals when he has the status of <b>an acute mourner,</b> i.e., before the burial of a close relative who died, <b>but he may not eat</b> of the offering. <b>Learn from it</b> that a leper <b>practices the customs of his leprosy during the Festival.</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from it</b> that this is so.

### Part 21
§ The source for the <i>halakha</i> that <b>it is prohibited for a mourner to</b> receive <b>a haircut is</b> derived <b>from</b> the fact that <b>the Merciful One states to the sons of Aaron: “Let not the hair of your heads go loose”</b> (Leviticus 10:6). It was prohibited for them to let their hair grow long during their period of mourning over the death of their brothers, Nadav and Avihu. <b>By inference,</b> it is teaching <b>that for everyone</b> else, i.e., non-priests, <b>it is prohibited</b> to cut their hair during the period of mourning.
