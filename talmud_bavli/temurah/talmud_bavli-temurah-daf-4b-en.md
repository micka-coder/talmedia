### Part 1
he was <b>referring</b> not to liability for lashes, but <b>to the exemption</b> from lashes stated in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan (3a). <b>And this</b> is what he <b>is saying: One is not flogged for</b> transgressing <b>a prohibition that does not involve an action</b>…<b>They said in the name of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina,</b> that <b>also one who</b> separates <b><i>teruma</i> prior to</b> the separation of <b>the first fruits</b> is not flogged, since he performs no action.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is different</b> about <b>one who effects substitution, that he is flogged</b> despite not having performed an action? Is it <b>because he has performed an action with his speech,</b> by consecrating the animal? If so, one who separates <b><i>teruma</i> prior to</b> the separation of <b>the first fruits should be flogged as well, because he has performed an action with his speech,</b> by consecrating the produce.

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Avin said: It is different there,</b> in the case of one who tithes produce in the wrong order, <b>as it is a prohibition</b> whose violation <b>can be rectified by</b> fulfilling <b>a positive mitzva.</b> As a rule, if the Torah specifies a positive mitzva to be performed after transgressing a prohibition to rectify it, that prohibition does not carry a punishment of lashes. This is the case here, <b>as it is written: “Out of all of your tithes you shall set apart</b> all of that which is due to the Lord” (Numbers 18:29), which teaches that one who separated tithes in the incorrect order or who separated <i>teruma</i> before separating the first fruits, must still separate the earlier tithes even after the later tithes, or the first fruits even after the <i>teruma</i>.

### Part 4
§ <b>Rav Dimi was sitting and saying this <i>halakha</i>,</b> that one who separates <i>teruma</i> prior to separating the first fruits is not flogged because it is a prohibition whose violation can be rectified. <b>Abaye said to him: And</b> is it correct that <b>one is not flogged</b> for transgressing <b>any prohibition</b> whose violation <b>can be rectified by</b> fulfilling <b>a positive mitzva?</b>

### Part 5
<b>But</b> there is the case of <b>one who effects substitution, which is a prohibition</b> whose violation <b>can be rectified by</b> fulfilling <b>a positive mitzva,</b> as the verse states: “He shall not exchange it, nor substitute it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good; and if he shall at all change animal for animal, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy” (Leviticus 27:10). <b>And</b> even so, one who effects substitution <b>is flogged, as we learned</b> in the mishna (2a): That is <b>not</b> to say <b>that it is permitted for a person to effect substitution; rather,</b> it means <b>that if one substituted</b> a non-sacred animal for a consecrated animal, the <b>substitution takes effect and</b> the one who substituted the non-sacred animal <b>incurs</b> the punishment of <b>the forty</b> lashes.

### Part 6
Rav Dimi answered: <b>There are two prohibitions</b> specified in the verse as transgressed by one who effects substitution: “He shall not exchange it,” and: “Nor substitute it.” <b>But</b> there is only <b>one positive mitzva:</b> “Both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy.” <b>And one positive mitzva does not come and uproot two prohibitions.</b> Therefore, although generally, one who transgresses a prohibition that can be rectified is not flogged, one who effects substitution is flogged.

### Part 7
The Gemara counters: <b>But there is</b> the case of the <b>rapist</b> who forces himself upon a virgin, who is obligated to marry the victim if she wishes and is then prohibited from divorcing her. <b>As</b> here the verse states <b>one prohibition:</b> “He may not send her away all his days,” <b>and one positive mitzva:</b> “And she shall be his wife” (Deuteronomy 22:29). This teaches that he can rectify the transgression of divorcing her by remarrying her. <b>And</b> yet, the <b>one positive mitzva does not come and uproot</b> the <b>prohibition, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a rapist who</b> married and then <b>divorced</b> his victim, <b>if he is an Israelite,</b> who is permitted to marry a divorcée, <b>he remarries</b> her <b>and he is not flogged. But if he is a priest,</b> who is prohibited from marrying a divorcée, <b>he is flogged and he does not remarry</b> her.

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: <b>You say</b> that a case that concerns <b>priests</b> challenges the principle that a rectifiable transgression does not make one liable for flogging. But in the case of <b>priests</b> there <b>is another reason</b> why they are flogged, <b>as the Merciful One increased</b> the severity of their transgressions, for they have <b>greater holiness.</b> By contrast, one who transgresses a prohibition unrelated to the priesthood will not be flogged if its violation can be rectified by fulfilling a positive mitzva.

### Part 9
§ Which prohibitions carry the punishment of lashes is <b>subject to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states concerning the Paschal offering: “And <b>you shall let nothing of it remain until the morning,</b> but that which remains of it until the morning you shall burn with fire” (Exodus 12:10). <b>The verse comes to place a positive mitzva after</b> the <b>prohibition</b> in order <b>to say that one is not flogged for</b> transgressing <b>it.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Ya’akov says:</b> He <b>is not</b> exempt from lashes <b>for</b> that <b>reason,</b> but <b>rather because it is a prohibition that does not involve an action, and one is not flogged for</b> transgressing <b>any prohibition that does not involve an action.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>By inference,</b> it may be concluded <b>that Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that one <b>is flogged for</b> transgressing a prohibition that does not involve an action.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rabbi Ya’akov,</b> who holds that the exemption from lashes stems from the prohibition’s not involving an action, <b>for what</b> purpose does the clause <b>“but that which remains of it until the morning you shall burn with fire” come?</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara answers: <b>He requires it for that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 83a): <b>The bones</b> of the Paschal offering that contain edible marrow but cannot be eaten because it is prohibited to break the bones of the Paschal offering, <b>and the sinews, and the leftover</b> meat must all <b>be burned on the sixteenth</b> of Nisan, immediately after the first day of the Festival. If the <b>sixteenth occurs on Shabbat, they</b> must <b>be burned on the seventeenth, because</b> the mitzva to burn <b>them does not override Shabbat or</b> the <b>Festival.</b> Therefore, they are burned on the first weekday.

### Part 13
<b>And Ḥizkiyya says, and so it is taught in the school of Ḥizkiyya: What is the reason</b> for this? <b>The verse states:</b> “And you shall let nothing of it remain until the morning, <b>but that which remains of it until the morning you shall burn with fire.”</b> By using the word “morning” twice, <b>the verse comes to provide a second morning for</b> the offering’s <b>burning</b> if the first morning falls on Shabbat or a Festival.

### Part 14
§ <b>Abaye said:</b> With regard to <b>any matter that the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah <b>not to perform, if one performed</b> it, his action <b>is effective,</b> but the violator is flogged. <b>As, if it enters your mind</b> that <b>it is not effective, why</b> would he be <b>flogged</b> for accomplishing nothing? <b>Rava said:</b> If one performed it, <b>it is not effective at all. And this</b> is the reason <b>that he is flogged: Because he transgressed the statement of the Merciful One.</b>
