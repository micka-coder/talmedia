### Part 1
<b>But with regard to the offspring of the substitute of a guilt offering, where there is no burnt offering status for its mother,</b> as the animal for which it was substituted was a guilt offering, <b>Rabbi Elazar concedes that</b> an animal purchased <b>with its money,</b> received from selling the offspring, <b>yes,</b> it is sacrificed as a burnt offering, but the offspring <b>itself is not sacrificed</b> as a burnt offering.

### Part 2
<b>Abaye raised an objection</b> to Rava: <b>And does Rabbi Elazar require that there be burnt offering status for its mother,</b> in order for the offspring to be sacrificed as a burnt offering? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who designates a female</b> animal <b>for his Paschal offering,</b> which must be a male, the animal is left to <b>graze until it becomes unfit, and it is</b> then <b>sold and he brings a Paschal offering with</b> the <b>money</b> received for <b>its</b> sale. If the female animal <b>gave birth</b> to a male,the offspring may not be sacrificed as a Paschal offering despite the fact that it is a male. Rather, <b>it</b> is left to <b>graze until it becomes unfit, and</b> then <b>it is sold and he brings a Paschal offering with</b> the <b>money</b> received from <b>its</b> sale.

### Part 3
If the animal <b>remained</b> without a blemish until <b>after Passover, it</b> is left to <b>graze until it becomes unfit, and he brings a peace offering with</b> the <b>money</b> received for <b>its</b> sale. If <b>it gave birth</b> to a male after Passover, the offspring too is left to <b>graze until it becomes unfit, and</b> then <b>it is sold, and he brings a peace offering with</b> the <b>money</b> received for <b>its</b> sale. <b>Rabbi Elazar</b> disagrees in the latter case and <b>says:</b> The offspring <b>itself is sacrificed as a peace offering.</b>

### Part 4
Abaye explains his objection: <b>But here,</b> it is a case <b>where there is no peace offering status for its mother,</b> as the mother was consecrated as a Paschal offering, <b>and</b> yet <b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> that the offspring <b>is sacrificed</b> as <b>a peace offering.</b> Rava <b>said to</b> Abaye in response: <b>Do you say</b> that this statement of <b>Rabbi Elazar</b> with regard to a Paschal offering <b>after Passover</b> contradicts my explanation? Not so; the status of a Paschal offering <b>after Passover is different, as a leftover Paschal offering itself is sacrificed as a peace offering.</b> Therefore, a female animal designated as a Paschal offering has the status of a peace offering after Passover.

### Part 5
Abaye asked Rava: <b>If so,</b> that the reason Rabbi Elazar permits the offspring to be sacrificed is that the mother also has the status of a peace offering, <b>let</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>also disagree</b> with the Rabbis <b>in the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>, where the female animal designated as a Paschal offering gave birth before Passover. Rabbi Elazar should state that this offspring itself may be brought as a peace offering, as here too the mother has the status of a peace offering, since a Paschal offering slaughtered before Passover as a peace offering is valid. Rava <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>Yes,</b> it <b>is indeed so, and they disagree</b> in this case as well.

### Part 6
<b>Abaye</b> suggested another explanation of the opinion of Rabbi Elazar and <b>said:</b> In a case where the female animal designated as a Paschal offering gave birth before Passover, there is <b>nobody</b> who <b>disagrees;</b> rather, they all agree that the offspring may not be sacrificed. <b>As</b> it <b>is learned</b> as a tradition that <b>to the place that the leftover</b> offering <b>goes, the offspring goes</b> as well. Therefore, <b>after Passover, when the leftover</b> Paschal offering <b>is sacrificed</b> as <b>a peace offering, the offspring is also sacrificed as a peace offering.</b>

### Part 7
<b>But before Passover,</b> when the Paschal offering is not yet considered leftover, the offspring is endowed with the same sanctity as the mother. In <b>what</b> way <b>is the mother consecrated?</b> It is consecrated <b>for the value of a Paschal offering,</b> that is, so that it should be sold and a Paschal offering should be purchased with the proceeds, as the female animal itself may not be sacrificed as a Paschal offering. If so, <b>the offspring as well</b> is consecrated only <b>for the value of a Paschal offering.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rav Ukva bar Ḥama raises an objection</b> to this explanation of Abaye: <b>And do we say</b> that Rabbi Elazar maintains <b>that as its mother</b> is consecrated only <b>for the value of</b> a Paschal offering, <b>the offspring as well</b> is consecrated only <b>for the value of</b> a Paschal offering? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who designates a female</b> animal <b>as a Paschal offering, it and its offspring</b> are left to <b>graze until they become unfit, and</b> then <b>they are sold, and he brings a Paschal offering with</b> the <b>money</b> received for <b>their</b> sale. <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The offspring <b>itself is sacrificed</b> as <b>a Paschal offering.</b>

### Part 9
<b>But here</b> it is a case <b>where its mother</b> was consecrated <b>for the value of</b> a Paschal offering, <b>and</b> nevertheless <b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> that the offspring <b>itself is sacrificed as a Paschal offering, and we do not establish</b> the status of the offspring based upon the sanctity <b>of the mother.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Ravina says:</b> One can answer that here <b>we are dealing with</b> a case of one <b>who designates a pregnant animal,</b> and <b>Rabbi Elazar holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, who said</b> with regard to one who consecrates a pregnant animal for a specific purpose, that <b>if he left it out,</b> i.e., designated the fetus as having a different sanctity, it is <b>left out</b> from the sanctity of the mother and consecrated in accordance with the designated sanctity. The reason is <b>that a fetus is not</b> considered <b>the thigh of its mother,</b> but rather the mother and its offspring are considered two separate animals. Here too, it is only <b>its mother that is not sanctified with the inherent sanctity</b> of a Paschal offering, but only for the value of a Paschal offering, as it is female. <b>But</b> the offspring <b>is consecrated</b> as a Paschal offering.

### Part 11
<b>Mar Zutra, son of Rav Mari, said to Ravina: This, too, stands to reason, that we are dealing with</b> a case where he designated <b>a pregnant animal, from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches: It and its offspring.</b> This indicates that both the mother and its offspring were in existence at the time of the consecration. The Gemara comments: <b>Conclude from here</b> that this explanation is correct.
