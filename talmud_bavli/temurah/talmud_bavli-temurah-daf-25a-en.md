### Part 1
The Gemara asks: <b>Why aren’t they imbued with the sanctity</b> of the mother? The Gemara answers: <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds</b> that <b>the offspring of sacrificial</b> animals <b>are imbued with sanctity</b> only <b>as they come into being,</b> i.e., from the moment they are born. <b>As, if it enters your mind</b> that <b>they are sanctified</b> already <b>in the womb of their mother, why are they not imbued with the sanctity</b> of the mother? After all, <b>the sanctity of their mother has taken hold of them. Rather, learn from it</b> that the <b>offspring of sacrificial</b> animals <b>are sanctified</b> only <b>as they come into being.</b>

### Part 2
<b>And this <i>tanna</i></b> disagrees with Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and <b>holds</b> that the <b>offspring of sacrificial</b> animals <b>are sanctified in the womb of their mother. As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is written with regard to a firstborn: “But the firstborn among animals, which is born as a firstling to the Lord, man shall not consecrate it” (Leviticus 27:26). <b>If</b> that verse were <b>not</b> complete but merely <b>stated: The firstborn shall not consecrate, I would have said</b> that the verse is teaching that <b>a firstborn</b> man <b>shall not consecrate</b> non-sacred <b>items.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Man</b> shall not consecrate <b>it,”</b> i.e., <b>you may not consecrate it,</b> a firstborn animal, <b>but a firstborn man may consecrate</b> non-sacred <b>items.</b>

### Part 3
<b>But still, I</b> would <b>say</b> that specifically a firstborn man <b>may not consecrate</b> a firstborn animal with a different sanctity, <b>but others</b> who are not firstborns <b>may consecrate</b> a firstborn animal. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Among animals,”</b> indicating that <b>I am dealing with</b> firstborn <b>animals,</b> not firstborn men, i.e., the verse is teaching that all people are prohibited to consecrate a firstborn animal with a different sanctity that that of a firstborn.

### Part 4
The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that one also <b>cannot consecrate</b> the fetus of an animal pregnant with its firstborn while the fetus is still <b>in the womb</b> of its mother. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Which is born as a firstling to the Lord,”</b> indicating that <b>from</b> the time the animal <b>is born and consecrated to the Lord as a firstborn you cannot consecrate</b> it with a different sanctity, <b>but you may consecrate</b> it with a different sanctity while it is still <b>in the womb.</b>

### Part 5
One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> with regard to <b>the offspring of all</b> other <b>consecrated</b> animals it is <b>so,</b> that one may consecrate them with a different sanctity when they are still in the womb. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “But [<i>akh</i>],”</b> which <b>distinguished</b> between a firstborn animal, which one may consecrate with a different sanctity while it is still in the womb, and the offspring of other consecrated animals, which one may not consecrate with a different sanctity even when they are in the womb. <b>Evidently,</b> this <i>tanna</i> <b>holds</b> that the <b>offspring of sacrificial</b> animals <b>are sanctified in the womb of their mother.</b>

### Part 6
§ The mishna teaches that one may employ artifice to circumvent the obligation to give the firstborn to the priest by consecrating the fetus as a burnt offering before the time of birth, which is the point at which the animal becomes sanctified as a firstborn. <b>Rav Amram said to Rav Sheshet:</b> If an owner <b>said with regard to</b> the fetus of an animal pregnant with its <b>firstborn:</b> This fetus will be consecrated as <b>a burnt offering</b> at the same time that the sanctity of the firstborn takes effect, which is <b>when the majority</b> of the animal <b>leaves</b> the womb, what is the status of the offspring? <b>Is</b> the offspring <b>a burnt offering or is it a firstborn?</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara explains the dilemma: <b>Is it a burnt offering, as</b> the sanctity of a burnt offering is more stringent than the sanctity of a firstborn and therefore <b>each and every bit that exits</b> the womb becomes a burnt offering, which is <b>entirely consumed</b> upon the altar? <b>Or</b> perhaps <b>it is a firstborn,</b> because normally the sanctity of the firstborn takes effect at the moment of birth, and therefore <b>with regard to each and every bit</b> of the animal <b>that exits</b> the womb, <b>its status is</b> that of a firstborn.

### Part 8
The Gemara cites <b>another version</b> of the explanation of the dilemma: Is it a burnt offering <b>because it is imbued with</b> the more stringent <b>sanctity</b> of a burnt offering? <b>Or perhaps it is a firstborn because</b> God declared <b>its sanctity</b> as a firstborn upon exiting <b>from the womb.</b>

### Part 9
Rav Sheshet <b>said to</b> Rav Amram: <b>What is your dilemma?</b> Your dilemma <b>is</b> the same as that dilemma <b>which Ilfa raised:</b> With regard to the <b>gleanings</b> left for the poor, which the wealthy may not take, if the owner of a field at the harvest time <b>said:</b> This grain that is now on the stalk <b>will become ownerless</b> property, meaning that even the wealthy can acquire it, at precisely the same time as the <i>halakha</i> of gleanings left for the poor takes effect, which is <b>when the majority</b> of the grain <b>falls</b> off the stalk, what is the status of the grain after it falls off the stalk? <b>Is it gleanings</b> left for the poor <b>or is it ownerless</b> property that even the wealthy may take?

### Part 10
The Gemara explains the dilemma: <b>Is it gleanings, as its sanctity</b> is dictated <b>by the hand of Heaven</b> at the moment that the grain falls off the stalk? <b>Or perhaps it is ownerless</b> property, because that status is more inclusive, <b>as</b> both the <b>poor and</b> the <b>wealthy may acquire</b> the grain.

### Part 11
<b>And Abaye said</b> in response to Ilfa’s dilemma: <b>What is your dilemma?</b> When there is a conflict between <b>the statement of the Master,</b> i.e., God, who commanded that the grain become gleanings for the poor, <b>and the statement of the student,</b> the one who declared the grain to be ownerless property that may be acquired even by the wealthy, <b>to whose statement should one listen? So too,</b> with regard to Rav Amram’s dilemma, when there is a conflict between the statement of God and the statement of the student, <b>to whose statement should one listen?</b> Accordingly, the fetus is consecrated with the sanctity of a firstborn, not that of a burnt offering.

### Part 12
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who says: The offspring of this</b> non-sacred animal <b>is a burnt offering and</b> the animal <b>itself is a peace offering, his statement stands,</b> i.e., is effective. If he says: The animal <b>itself is a peace offering and its offspring is a burnt offering,</b> then since consecration of the mother preceded consecration of the offspring, it is <b>the offspring of a peace offering,</b> whose halakhic status is that of a peace offering; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>

### Part 13
<b>Rabbi Yosei said: If that was his intent from the outset,</b> to designate the offspring as a burnt offering when he designated the mother as a peace offering, then <b>since it is impossible to call</b> it by <b>two designations simultaneously, his statement stands,</b> and the mother is a peace offering and the offspring a burnt offering. <b>And if</b> it was only <b>after he said: This</b> animal <b>is hereby a peace offering,</b> that <b>he reconsidered and said: Its offspring is a burnt offering, that offspring is a peace offering,</b> as before he reconsidered, the offspring had already assumed the status of the offspring of a peace offering.

### Part 14
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In the case of <b>one who separated a pregnant</b> animal as <b>a sin offering and</b> that animal later <b>gave birth</b> to a female, both animals are consecrated as sin offerings. If <b>he wishes he may achieve atonement</b> by sacrificing the mother <b>itself,</b> and if <b>he wishes he may achieve atonement</b> by sacrificing <b>the offspring.</b> Since he consecrated the animal when it was already pregnant, his act of consecration took effect with regard to both the mother and the offspring.

### Part 15
<b>What is the reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan holds</b> that in the case of one who consecrated a pregnant animal, <b>if he reserved</b> the fetus and designated it as non-sacred, e.g., he said: The fetus is non-sacred and the animal itself is designated as a sin offering, then the offspring is considered <b>reserved</b> and is non-sacred, despite the fact that the mother is consecrated.

### Part 16
The reason is that Rabbi Yoḥanan holds that <b>a fetus is not</b> considered <b>the thigh,</b> i.e., a part, <b>of its mother.</b> Therefore, just as one can reserve the fetus from being consecrated with its mother, so too, one can consecrate the fetus with a separate sanctity than that of the mother. Consequently, <b>this</b> case <b>is like</b> that of one who <b>separates two sin offerings as a guarantee;</b> if <b>he wishes he may gain atonement with one</b> of them, and if <b>he wishes he may gain atonement with the other.</b>

### Part 17
<b>Rabbi Elazar raises an objection</b> from the mishna: If one says: The animal <b>itself is a peace offering and its offspring is a burnt offering,</b> then <b>it is the offspring of a peace offering. And if it enters your mind</b> that if <b>one reserved</b> the fetus from the consecration of the mother it is considered <b>reserved,</b> and its sanctity is independent from that of the mother, why does the mishna state with regard to the offspring that <b>it is the offspring of a peace offering,</b> which indicates that it receives its sanctity from that of the mother? The mishna <b>should teach</b> that the offspring <b>is a peace offering</b> with an independent sanctity.

### Part 18
<b>Rav Tavla said:</b> The discussion of this topic should be held <b>apart from this</b> version of the mishna, as it is incorrect. <b>Didn’t Rav say to the <i>tanna</i></b> who was reciting <i>mishnayot</i> that he should not recite the mishna with the phrase: It is the offspring of a peace offering, but rather, he should <b>teach: It is a peace offering.</b>

### Part 19
The Gemara <b>raises</b> another <b>objection</b> to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who says to his</b> Canaanite <b>maidservant: You are hereby</b> still <b>a maidservant but your</b> unborn <b>child is a freeman,</b> and he writes a bill of manumission for the child and places it in her hand, <b>if she was pregnant</b> at that time, then <b>she acquired</b> freedom <b>for</b> the unborn child.

### Part 20
The Gemara explains the objection: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that <b>if one reserved</b> a certain consecration it is <b>not</b> considered <b>reserved,</b> and therefore the sanctity of the mother takes effect on her offspring, and likewise that <b>a fetus is</b> considered <b>the thigh of its mother,</b> it is <b>due to that</b> reason that <b>she acquired</b> freedom <b>for</b> the unborn child. <b>And</b> the explanation is that <b>this</b> case <b>is like</b> that of <b>one who emancipates half of his slave,</b> as that half is thereby emancipated. <b>And whose</b> opinion is this? <b>It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>:
