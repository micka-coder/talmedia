### Part 1
<b>And he derives</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>the end of a consecrated</b> animal <b>from the initial consecration</b> of the animal, as follows: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>the initial</b> state of <b>consecration</b> of the animal, <b>an inheritor</b> can <b>effect substitution, so too,</b> with regard to <b>the end of the consecrated</b> animal, <b>an inheritor places</b> his <b>hands</b> on its head.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: According to <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who holds that an inheritor is not able to effect substitution, <b>what does he do with this</b> repetitive language in the verse: <b>“And if he shall at all substitute”?</b> How does he interpret it? The Gemara answers: It serves <b>to include a woman</b> as able to effect substitution and to incur the penalty of forty lashes for doing so. <b>And</b> this is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Since</b> the verses concerning <b>the entire matter</b> of substitution <b>speak only in the masculine, as it is stated: “He shall not exchange it, nor substitute it”</b> (Leviticus 27:10), <b>from where</b> is it derived that <b>a woman</b> is included? <b>The verse states: “And if he shall at all substitute,” to include a woman.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Rabbi Meir,</b> who derives a different <i>halakha</i> from that verse, <b>from where</b> does <b>he</b> derive that <b>a woman</b> is included? The Gemara answers: <b>He derives it from</b> the addition of the conjunction “and” in the verse: <b>“And if</b> he shall at all substitute.” <b>And Rabbi Yehuda does not interpret</b> the term <b>“and if”</b> as having any special significance.

### Part 4
The Gemara analyzes this dispute. <b>And</b> according to <b>both</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir and</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, the reason</b> why a woman is included is <b>that the verse</b> explicitly <b>includes a woman,</b> either by adding a conjunction or by repetition of the verb. The Gemara asks: Should one infer that if <b>the verse did not include</b> a woman, <b>I would say</b> that <b>when</b> a woman <b>performs</b> an act of <b>substitution she is not flogged? But didn’t Rav Yehuda say</b> that <b>Rav says, and so too the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught,</b> that when the verse states: <b>“When a man or woman shall commit any sin that people commit”</b> (Numbers 5:6), <b>the verse equates a woman with a man with regard to all punishments of the Torah?</b> Why, then, is there a need for the verse to include women in the prohibition against substitution?

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: It <b>was necessary</b> for the verse to include women specifically, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>this statement</b> that equates women with men in general refers only to <b>a punishment that</b> applies <b>equally to an individual and to the public. But here, since it is a punishment that does not</b> apply <b>equally to all, as we learned</b> in a mishna (13a): <b>The public and partners do not render</b> an animal <b>a substitute,</b> one could claim that <b>a woman as well, when she performs</b> an act of substitution, <b>is not flogged.</b> The verse therefore <b>teaches us</b> that she is in fact liable.

### Part 6
§ <b>Rami bar Ḥama raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>a minor, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is he able <b>to effect substitution</b> or not? The Gemara clarifies: <b>What are the circumstances</b> where this question arises? <b>If we say</b> that it is referring <b>to a minor who has yet to reach the age of</b> responsibility for his <b>vows,</b> i.e., twelve years and one day, <b>you should not raise the dilemma, as since he cannot consecrate</b> an animal by means of a vow, <b>can he effect substitution? Rather, when he raises this dilemma,</b> it is <b>with regard to a minor who has reached the age of</b> responsibility for his <b>vows.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara explains the dilemma: <b>Do we say</b> that a minor can effect substitution, <b>since the Master said</b> with regard to consecration: The verse states: “When <b>a man</b> shall clearly utter a vow” (Numbers 30:3). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> the unusual formulation: <b>Shall clearly utter [<i>yafli</i>] a vow,</b> instead of the more conventional term: Shall take a vow [<i>yiddor</i>]? This serves <b>to include a discriminating</b> minor <b>[<i>mufla</i>] on the brink of adulthood,</b> teaching <b>that his consecration takes effect.</b> Perhaps, from the fact <b>that he can consecrate</b> an animal, <b>he can also effect substitution. Or perhaps, since no</b> minor <b>is subject to punishments, he cannot apply</b> sanctity to an animal <b>by</b> an act of <b>substitution,</b> which would incur a punishment.

### Part 8
And even <b>if you say</b> that <b>a minor can perform substitution, as he will come to</b> an age when he is <b>subject to punishments, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> as to whether <b>a gentile</b> can <b>effect substitution? Do you say</b> that he can do so from the fact <b>that his consecration takes effect, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“Any man [<i>ish ish</i>]…</b>that brings his offering.” <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> repetitively <b>“<i>ish ish</i>”?</b> This serves <b>to include gentiles,</b> teaching <b>that they</b> can <b>take vows</b> to bring <b>vow offerings and gift offerings as a Jew</b> can. Since the consecration of a gentile takes effect, perhaps <b>he can effect substitution as well. Or perhaps, since he will not come to</b> a time when he is <b>subject to punishments,</b> therefore <b>when he performs</b> an act of <b>substitution,</b> the animal is <b>not consecrated.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rava says: Come</b> and <b>hear, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Zevaḥim</i> 5:6): With regard to animals <b>consecrated by gentiles,</b> one <b>may not derive benefit</b> from them <i>ab initio</i>, <b>but</b> if one derived benefit from them, he is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property after the fact. <b>And</b> if one consumes <b>them one is not liable for</b> committing a transgression <b>with regard to</b> the prohibitions of <b><i>piggul</i></b> if they were sacrificed with the intent to consume them beyond their designated time, of <b><i>notar</i></b> if he consumed them beyond their designated time, <b>and</b> of consuming <b>ritually impure</b> offerings if he was impure. Gentiles <b>cannot render</b> a non-sacred animal <b>a substitute</b> for one they consecrate. <b>And one does not bring libations for</b> the offerings of a gentile as independent offerings, <b>but his offering requires libations.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Shimon.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Yosei said: With regard to all of them I see</b> fit <b>to be stringent. In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that Rabbi Shimon exempts animals consecrated by gentiles from liability for misuse, <b>said?</b> It is said <b>with regard to</b> animals <b>consecrated for the altar,</b> i.e., offerings; <b>but with regard to</b> animals <b>consecrated for Temple maintenance,</b> one who derives benefit from <b>them</b> is liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property. Rava notes: <b>In any event,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that gentiles <b>cannot render</b> an animal <b>a substitute</b> for his offering.

### Part 11
The Gemara responds: <b>And Rami bar Ḥama</b> can say: <b>I do not raise a dilemma</b> in a case <b>where a gentile consecrated</b> an animal as an offering <b>for a gentile</b> such as himself <b>to achieve atonement.</b> In this case the <i>baraita</i> rules explicitly that he cannot effect substitution. <b>When I raise the dilemma,</b> it is in a case <b>where a gentile consecrated</b> an animal as an offering <b>and a Jew achieves atonement</b> with it. In this situation, <b>do we follow</b> the <b>one who consecrated</b> it, in which case the gentile cannot effect substitution, <b>or do we follow the one achieving atonement,</b> in which case he can?

### Part 12
The Gemara suggests: <b>Solve this</b> dilemma <b>by</b> invoking a statement <b>of Rabbi Abbahu, as Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If <b>one consecrates</b> an animal as an offering to be brought by another, and the animal develops a blemish disqualifying it for sacrifice, if the one who consecrated it desires to redeem it, he <b>adds one-fifth</b> to its value, just as he would were it his own offering. By contrast, if the one achieving atonement with the offering desires to redeem it, he does not need to add one-fifth. <b>But the one achieving atonement</b> with the offering <b>can render</b> another animal <b>a substitute</b> for it as if he had consecrated it. <b>And</b> if <b>one separates <i>teruma</i>,</b> the portion of produce designated for a priest, <b>from his own</b> produce
