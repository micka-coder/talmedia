### Part 1
that <b>blemished</b> animals <b>can be redeemed; and we established</b> that according to Reish Lakish, the <i>baraita</i> is dealing <b>with</b> animals <b>whose consecrations preceded their blemishes,</b> which means that although the animal has inherent sanctity because it was consecrated when unblemished, nevertheless it can be redeemed; let us <b>conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that <b>one may redeem sacrificial</b> animals in order <b>to feed them to dogs.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: One cannot arrive at this conclusion from the <i>baraita</i>, since when the <i>baraita</i> states that the animals died it is not referring to deaths due to natural causes. Rather, <b>what are we dealing with here? With</b> a case <b>where</b> one <b>transgressed</b> the prohibition against slaughtering the blemished animals <b>and slaughtered them</b> before they were redeemed, an act that nevertheless renders them permitted for human consumption after redemption.

### Part 3
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>all sacrificial</b> animals <b>that developed a blemish and</b> one <b>slaughtered them, Rabbi Meir says</b> that <b>they shall be buried,</b> as he holds in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon that animals consecrated for the altar were included in the <i>halakha</i> of standing and valuation and must be buried if they died. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> Since an animal consecrated for the altar is not included in the <i>halakha</i> of standing and valuation, even if one slaughtered it, <b>it can be redeemed.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya</b> further <b>said to Rabbi Zeira: According to Rabbi Shimon, who said</b> that animals <b>consecrated for Temple maintenance were not included in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>standing and valuation</b> and are redeemed if they died, <b>why</b> does he state, in the last <i>baraita</i> cited earlier, that <b>unblemished</b> animals consecrated for Temple maintenance <b>shall be buried</b> and not redeemed? Rabbi Zeira responds: It is <b>because they are fit for sacrifice</b> upon the altar.

### Part 5
The Gemara explains the significance of the fact that these animals, which were consecrated for Temple maintenance, are fit for the altar. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who associates unblemished</b> animals, i.e., consecrates them by means of associating their sanctity with sanctified items, <b>for Temple maintenance,</b> when they are redeemed by the treasurer <b>they are redeemed only for the altar,</b> i.e., they are sold to those who must bring an offering, and the animals are sacrificed upon the altar. They may be redeemed only for the altar, not for any non-sacred use, <b>as any</b> consecrated item <b>that is fit</b> to be sacrificed <b>on the altar may never leave</b> the custody of the <b>altar.</b>

### Part 6
§ The Gemara continues to analyze the opinions of Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish. <b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye, and some say</b> that <b>Rava</b> said to Abaye: <b>According to Rabbi Yoḥanan, who interprets</b> the above <i>baraita</i> as referring <b>to</b> an animal <b>blemished from the outset, and</b> who further claims that <b>everyone,</b> i.e., Rabbi Shimon and the Rabbis, <b>holds that</b> an animal <b>blemished from the outset was not included in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>standing and valuation,</b> one may ask: <b>And</b> do they both agree that an animal blemished from the outset was <b>not</b> included in that <i>halakha</i>?

### Part 7
<b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Bekhorot</i> 14a): <b>All the sacrificial</b> animals in <b>which a permanent blemish preceded their consecration</b> are not sanctified as offerings; rather, they are sold and the money received is used to purchase valid offerings. <b>And</b> once <b>they are redeemed,</b> they <b>are obligated in,</b> i.e., subject to accounting their offspring, <b>a firstborn; and in the</b> priestly <b>gifts</b> of the foreleg, jaw, and maw; <b>and they emerge</b> from their sacred status and assume complete <b>non-sacred</b> status in order <b>to be shorn and to be utilized for labor.</b>

### Part 8
And <b>their offspring and their milk are permitted after their redemption. And one who slaughters them outside</b> the Temple courtyard is <b>exempt</b> from <i>karet</i>, even if the animal was not yet redeemed, <b>and</b> those animals <b>do not render</b> an animal exchanged for them <b>a substitute. And if</b> these animals <b>died</b> before they were redeemed, <b>they may be redeemed.</b>

### Part 9
<b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says,</b> with regard to this mishna: <b>This</b> statement, that one who consecrates a blemished animal for the altar may redeem it if it dies, is in accordance with <b>the statement of Rabbi Shimon, who says</b> that animals <b>consecrated for the altar were included in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>standing and valuation,</b> but animals <b>consecrated for Temple maintenance were not</b> included. <b>As we learned</b> in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: If</b> animals <b>consecrated for Temple maintenance died, they can be redeemed,</b> since they were not included in the <i>halakha</i> of standing and valuation. But animals consecrated for the altar that died are buried, as they were included in this <i>halakha</i>.

### Part 10
<b>And Rabbi Shimon concedes with regard to</b> an animal that was <b>blemished from the outset,</b> which was consecrated for the altar and died, <b>that it is redeemed. What is the reason? As the verse states:</b> “Then he shall set the animal before the priest. And the priest shall value <b>it”</b> (Leviticus 27:11–12). The emphasis of <b>“it”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> an animal that was <b>blemished from the outset</b> from the <i>halakha</i> of standing and valuation. <b>But the Rabbis say:</b> Every animal consecrated for the altar, <b>even</b> one that was <b>blemished from the outset, was included in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>standing and valuation,</b> and must be buried if it dies. This apparently contradicts the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, who says that according to the Rabbis an animal that was blemished from the outset was not included in the <i>halakha</i> of standing and valuation.

### Part 11
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Pappa, or Rava: The statement of Rav Yehuda in the name of Rav does not pose a difficulty for Rabbi Yoḥanan, as Rav was not referring to the Rabbis of the mishna, who disagree with Rabbi Shimon. Rather, <b>who is</b> the <i>tanna</i> referred to here as <b>the Rabbis?</b> It is <b>a <i>tanna</i> of the school of Levi.</b> The other rabbi questioned Abaye’s answer: <b>If so,</b> that even the Rabbis of the mishna hold that an animal that was blemished from the outset is redeemed, why did Rav Yehuda say that Rav said that <b>this</b> mishna in tractate <i>Bekhorot</i> is in accordance with <b>the statement of Rabbi Shimon, and nothing more?</b> This statement indicates that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon alone. <b>He should have</b> said that <b>this</b> mishna is in accordance with the <b>statement of Rabbi Shimon and</b> those who <b>disagree</b> with <b>him,</b> i.e., the Rabbis.

### Part 12
Abaye <b>said to him:</b> The reason <b>that</b> Rav Yehuda <b>does not teach</b> in <b>this</b> manner, i.e., he does not say that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis, is <b>because Rav holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish, who said</b> that <b>according to the Rabbis</b> of the mishna, only animals <b>consecrated for Temple maintenance were included in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>standing and valuation;</b> animals <b>consecrated for the altar were not</b> included, and are therefore redeemed.

### Part 13
<b>And</b> admittedly <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna can be explained in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis, as it <b>teaches</b> that <b>if they died they can be redeemed.</b> This ruling is in accordance with the Rabbis, as an animal that was blemished from the outset is considered as one consecrated for the altar, since as it was consecrated in order to be sold to purchase a valid offering. But <b>the latter clause</b> of the mishna, which discusses a case where the consecration of the animal preceded the development of a blemish, is not in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis, as it <b>teaches</b> that <b>if they died they shall be buried.</b> According to Reish Lakish and Rav, the Rabbis hold that in such a case the animal is redeemed. Consequently, the mishna cannot be in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis.

### Part 14
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>Rav holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> that the Rabbis maintain that all consecrations were included in the <i>halakha</i> of standing and valuation and are buried if they died, and the mishna is in fact in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis. <b>And</b> as for <b>that</b> which posed <b>a difficulty for you,</b> that Rav Yehuda <b>should have</b> said that <b>this</b> mishna is in accordance with <b>the statement of Rabbi Shimon and</b> those who <b>disagree</b> with <b>him, say: Indeed</b> he said so, that the mishna is in accordance with <b>the opinion of</b> Rabbi Shimon and those who disagree with him.

### Part 15
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>And these are the</b> items <b>that are buried</b> from which deriving benefit is forbidden: In the case of <b>a sacrificial</b> animal <b>that miscarried,</b> the fetus <b>shall be buried.</b> If the animal <b>miscarried a placenta,</b> the placenta <b>shall be buried. And</b> the same <i>halakha</i> applies to <b>an ox that is stoned</b> for killing a person; <b>and a heifer whose neck is broken</b> when a corpse is found between two cities and the killer is unknown; <b>and the birds</b> brought <b>by a leper</b> for purification; <b>and the hair of a nazirite</b> who became ritually impure, who shaves his head before beginning a new term of naziriteship.

### Part 16
<b>And</b> the same <i>halakha</i> applies to <b>the firstborn of a donkey</b> that, if it is not redeemed with a sheep, has its neck broken; <b>and</b> a forbidden mixture <b>of meat</b> cooked <b>in milk; and non-sacred</b> animals <b>that were slaughtered in the Temple courtyard. Rabbi Shimon says: Non-sacred</b> animals <b>that were slaughtered in the Temple courtyard shall be burned,</b> like sacrificial animals that were disqualified in the courtyard. <b>And likewise, an undomesticated animal that was slaughtered in the Temple courtyard,</b> although it is not similar to the animals sacrificed in the Temple, shall be burned by rabbinic decree.

### Part 17
<b>And these are the</b> items <b>that are burned: Leavened bread on Passover shall be burned. And</b> the same <i>halakha</i> applies to <b>ritually impure <i>teruma</i>. And</b> with regard to <b>the fruit that grows on a tree during the three years after it was planted [<i>orla</i>], and diverse kinds</b> of food crops sown <b>in a vineyard, those</b> items <b>whose</b> appropriate <b>manner</b> of destruction <b>is to be burned,</b> e.g., foods, <b>shall be burned; and those</b> items <b>whose</b> appropriate <b>manner</b> of destruction <b>is to be buried,</b> e.g., liquids, <b>shall be buried. And one</b> may <b>ignite</b> a fire <b>with bread and with oil of</b> impure <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> even though the priest derives benefit from that fire. And with regard to <b>all sacrificial</b> animals <b>that were slaughtered</b> with the intent to sacrifice or consume them <b>beyond their</b> designated <b>time or outside their</b> designated <b>place, those</b> animals <b>shall be burned.</b>
