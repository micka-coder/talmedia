### Part 1
<b>and</b> in this manner all forty <i>se’a</i> <b>are ritually pure.</b> The reason is <b>that drawn</b> water <b>is purified by a majority</b> of fit water that was already present in the ritual bath <b>and by</b> the drawn water <b>flowing</b> into the ritual bath. This is the meaning of the mishna’s statement that drawn water invalidates the ritual bath only according to calculation: One calculates the amount of drawn water that flowed into the ritual bath, as the ritual bath is invalid only if most of the forty <i>se’a</i> is of that drawn water.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: If this is the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov alone, one must conclude <b>by inference that the Rabbis hold that</b> the ritual bath is <b>not</b> fit even <b>by</b> a <b>majority</b> of fit water <b>and by</b> the <b>flowing</b> of the drawn water. <b>But</b> if so, consider <b>that</b> which <b>Ravin</b> said <b>when</b> he <b>came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, namely, that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> A ritual bath that consists <b>in its entirety</b> of <b>drawn</b> water <b>that one made flow</b> into it <b>is pure.</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is this? It is <b>not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who maintain that drawn water invalidates the ritual bath even if it flowed into it, <b>and</b> it is <b>not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> ben Ya’akov, who holds that drawn water invalidates the ritual bath if it constitutes a majority of the forty <i>se’a</i>.

### Part 3
<b>Rather, Rabba says:</b> The mishna’s ruling, that drawn water invalidates the ritual bath only according to calculation, is not referring to drawn water that flowed. Instead, it means <b>according to</b> the <b>calculation of</b> the number of <b>vessels</b> from which the drawn water was directly poured into the ritual bath, <b>and</b> this <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Yosef ben Ḥoni.</b>

### Part 4
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>three <i>log</i> of drawn water fell into the water</b> of a ritual bath that lacked the requisite measure, <b>from two or three vessels,</b> with each containing at least one <i>log</i> of drawn water, <b>or even from four or five vessels,</b> where no whole <i>log</i> fell in at once, it <b>invalidates the ritual bath. Yosef ben Ḥoni says:</b> It is only if the drawn water was <b>in two or three vessels</b> that the water <b>invalidates the ritual bath.</b> But if the drawn water was <b>in four or five</b> vessels, the water <b>does not invalidate the ritual bath.</b> This is what the mishna means.

### Part 5
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And the water of purification</b> of the red heifer <b>becomes water of purification only</b> with the placement of the ashes into the water, but not by the placement of water onto the ashes. The Gemara asks: <b>Who is the <i>tanna</i></b> whose opinion is reflected in this ruling? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said that</b> it is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b>

### Part 6
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A <i>sota</i>, a woman suspected of unfaithfulness by her husband, must drink bitter waters prepared in the Temple. The verse states: “And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is on the floor of the Tabernacle the priest shall take and put it into the water” (Numbers 5:17). This verse teaches that the water must be placed in the vessel first, and the dust is placed on top of it. If one places the <b>dust</b> in the vessel <b>before the water,</b> the mixture is <b>unfit, but Rabbi Shimon deems</b> it <b>fit.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Shimon? As it is written</b> with regard to the red heifer: <b>“And for the impure they shall take of the dust of the burning of the purification from sin, and place on it flowing water</b> in a vessel” (Numbers 19:17). <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon said: But is it dust [<i>afar</i>]</b> that is taken? <b>Isn’t it</b> really <b>ashes [<i>efer</i>]?</b>

### Part 8
Evidently <b>the verse altered its</b> standard <b>usage</b> and referred to ashes as dust in order <b>to derive a verbal analogy from it: “Dust” is stated</b> in the verse <b>here, and “dust” is stated there,</b> with regard to the <i>sota</i>. <b>Just as there,</b> in the case of the <i>sota</i>, the verse teaches that the <b>dust</b> must be placed <b>on top of the water, so too here,</b> with regard to the red heifer, the <b>dust,</b> i.e., ashes, must be placed <b>on top of the water. And</b> likewise, <b>just as here,</b> with regard to the red heifer, if one places the <b>dust</b> in the vessel <b>before the water,</b> it is <b>fit</b> after the fact, <b>so too there,</b> in the case of the <i>sota</i>, if one places the <b>dust</b> in the vessel <b>before the water,</b> it is <b>fit</b> after the fact.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>And here,</b> with regard to the red heifer, <b>from where do we</b> derive that the mixture is fit even if the dust is placed first? <b>Two phrases are written.</b> First it is written: “They shall take of the dust of the burning of the purification from sin <b>and place on it.” Apparently,</b> the <b>ashes</b> should be placed in the vessel <b>first</b> and the water afterward. <b>And then it is written: “Running water in a vessel,”</b> indicating that the water should be placed in the vessel first, while it is still empty. <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? They can be reconciled by concluding that if <b>he desires</b> to place the <b>dust,</b> i.e., the ashes of the red heifer, <b>below,</b> and put water on top, he may do so; and if <b>he desires</b> he may place the water first and then place the <b>dust above</b> the water.

### Part 10
<b>And the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna, who deems the mixture unfit if the ashes are placed first, <b>what is</b> his <b>reasoning?</b> He could <b>say to you</b> that <b>the last clause of the verse:</b> “Running water in a vessel,” is meant <b>specifically,</b> i.e., the water must be placed first. And when the verse states beforehand: “They shall take of the dust of the burning of the purification from sin <b>and place on it,”</b> this teaches only that after placing the ashes upon the water one is required <b>to mix</b> the ashes with the water, so that the water covers the ashes.

### Part 11
The Gemara objects: But one could just as easily say the opposite. <b>What did you see that</b> led <b>you</b> to <b>say</b> that <b>the last clause of the verse</b> is meant <b>specifically? Perhaps the first clause</b> of the verse is meant <b>specifically.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>You cannot say</b> so, as <b>just as we find in every instance</b> that the <b>facilitating item</b> goes <b>above,</b> e.g., in the case of a <i>sota</i> the dust, which enables the water to be used, goes on top of the water, <b>so too here,</b> in the case of the red heifer, the <b>facilitating item</b> must go <b>above.</b> The water must be placed first, and only then the ashes.

### Part 12
§ The mishna further teaches: <b>And</b> one <b><i>beit haperas</i> does not create</b> another <b><i>beit haperas</i>.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>The mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 17:2) that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> One <b><i>beit haperas</i> creates</b> another <b><i>beit haperas</i>.</b> If one plowed from a <i>beit haperas</i> into another field, that field is also ritually impure.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Eliezer, <b>how far</b> does a <i>beit haperas</i> extend? <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <b>Reish Lakish said</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon bar Abba said:</b>
