<b>the fetus itself. But here, where he consecrated its</b> pregnant <b>mother,</b> not the fetus itself, one might think that <b>this</b> fetus <b>is not consecrated along with its mother.</b>

### Part 2
<b>And if</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan had <b>taught us</b> only <b>this last</b> case, of one who consecrates a pregnant animal, I might have said that <b>it is</b> only <b>there</b> that its fetus is sacred, <b>as he consecrated</b> the animal <b>and all that is inside it,</b> including the fetus. <b>But here, where he consecrated</b> the fetus <b>itself, since</b> the object of the consecration <b>is not outside</b> its mother, as it has yet to be born, one might say that it is <b>not consecrated.</b> Therefore, it was <b>necessary</b> for Rabbi Yoḥanan to state both <i>halakhot</i>.

### Part 3
§ The Gemara cites <b>another version</b> of the discussion: <b>What is</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>teaching us</b> when he says above that one may atone with either the mother or the offspring? He is evidently saying that <b>if he</b> explicitly <b>excluded</b> the fetus from his consecration, it is <b>excluded,</b> and only the mother is consecrated. <b>And</b> the reason is that <b>a fetus is not</b> considered <b>the thigh of its mother</b> but a separate entity that can possess a different status. <b>But</b> if so, <b>why do I</b> need <b>two</b> <i>halakhot</i> to teach me this, both with regard to one who consecrates a pregnant animal and with regard to one who consecrates the fetus alone?

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: Both <i>halakhot</i> are <b>necessary, as, if it was stated</b> only <b>with regard to that</b> case of one who consecrates a pregnant animal, I would say that the fetus is consecrated <b>because its mother is fit to</b> be consecrated <b>itself,</b> and <b>since sanctity applies to her, it likewise applies to the offspring. But</b> in <b>the other</b> case of one who consecrates a fetus alone, perhaps it is <b>not</b> consecrated. Therefore, Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>teaches us this</b> case as well.

### Part 5
<b>And if it was stated</b> only <b>with regard to this</b> case of one who consecrates a fetus, one might say that the fetus is sanctified <b>because he expressly</b> states that <b>sanctity</b> should apply <b>to the offspring. But</b> with regard to <b>that</b> case of one who consecrates a pregnant animal, where he does not explicitly mention the fetus, perhaps is it <b>not</b> consecrated. Therefore, both statements are <b>necessary.</b>

### Part 6
§ <b>Rabbi Zeira sat and stated this <i>halakha</i></b> of the dispute between bar Padda and Rabbi Yoḥanan with regard to the consecration of fetuses. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya raised an objection to Rabbi Zeira</b> from a mishna (24b): <b>How</b> may <b>one employ artifice to</b> circumvent the obligation to give <b>the firstborn</b> to the priest and use the animal instead to fulfill a different obligation? He may approach <b>an animal</b> that is going to <b>give birth to its firstborn</b> but <b>which is</b> still <b>pregnant,</b> and <b>say: That which is in the womb of this</b> animal, if it is male, is designated as <b>a burnt offering.</b> If he did so, and the animal <b>gave birth to a male, it</b> will be sacrificed as <b>a burnt offering,</b> and it is not consecrated as a firstborn. <b>Evidently, a fetus</b> can be <b>consecrated,</b> contrary to the opinion of bar Padda.

### Part 7
Rabbi Zeira <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yirmeya: Bar Padda can answer that <b>when that</b> mishna <b>is taught,</b> it is referring <b>to</b> one who consecrates the fetus for <b>sanctity</b> that inheres in its <b>value,</b> i.e., that the offspring should be sold and a burnt offering brought with the proceeds. This form of sanctity does apply to a fetus, but inherent sanctity rendering it obligated to be sacrificed itself does not. Rabbi Yirmeya again asked Rabbi Zeira: <b>Is sanctity</b> that inheres in the animal’s <b>value</b> so <b>strong that it removes the firstborn</b> status <b>from</b> an animal?

### Part 8
Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: Yes, and</b> so <b>we learned</b> in a mishna in tractate <i>Bekhorot</i> (14a): <b>All sacrificial</b> animals in <b>which a permanent blemish preceded their consecration</b> assume not inherent sanctity but sanctity of value, <b>and</b> once <b>they are redeemed</b> they <b>are obligated,</b> i.e., subject <b>to,</b> accounting their offspring <b>a firstborn, and</b> one is obligated <b>to</b> give the <b>gifts</b> of the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw to a priest as for any non-sacred slaughtered animal. One can infer from the mishna that the <b>reason that</b> these animals <b>are obligated</b> is <b>that they have already been redeemed. But before they are redeemed,</b> they are <b>exempt</b> from the obligation of the firstborn and the gifts, despite the fact that only their value is sacred. <b>Evidently, sanctity</b> that inheres in the animal’s <b>value is strong</b> enough <b>to remove firstborn status from</b> an animal.

### Part 9
Rabbi Yirmeya <b>raised</b> another <b>objection to</b> bar Padda’s opinion from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one says: That which is in the womb of this</b> animal is <b>a burnt offering,</b> it is <b>permitted</b> for the mother <b>to be shorn but</b> it <b>is prohibited</b> to use it <b>for labor, due to</b> the inevitable <b>weakening</b> and consequent reduction in value <b>of</b> the <b>fetus that is inside it.</b> This indicates that fetuses are imbued with sanctity, contrary to the opinion of bar Padda. Rabbi Zeira <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yirmeya: <b>This</b> <i>baraita</i> is <b>also</b> referring to one who consecrates the fetus for <b>sanctity</b> that inheres in its <b>value,</b> and bar Padda concedes that this sanctity applies to the fetus.

### Part 10
Rabbi Yirmeya objected: <b>But is sanctity</b> that inheres in the animal’s <b>value</b> so <b>strong that it renders</b> the mother <b>prohibited for labor?</b> Rabbi Zeira <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yirmeya: <b>Yes, and</b> so <b>we learned</b> in the mishna cited previously, that blemished animals that were consecrated for their value and redeemed <b>emerge</b> from their sacred status and assume complete <b>non-sacred</b> status and may <b>be shorn and used for labor.</b> Apparently, the <b>reason</b> they may be used for labor is <b>that they were redeemed.</b> One may infer that <b>before they are redeemed, they are prohibited for labor. Evidently, sanctity</b> that inheres in the animal’s <b>value renders</b> the mother of the fetus <b>prohibited for labor.</b>

### Part 11
Rabbi Yirmeya <b>raised</b> another <b>objection to</b> bar Padda’s opinion from the mishna: <b>One does not substitute</b> non-sacred <b>limbs for</b> consecrated <b>fetuses, and</b> likewise one does <b>not</b> substitute non-sacred <b>fetuses for</b> consecrated <b>limbs,</b> or non-sacred limbs or fetuses for whole consecrated animals, or non-sacred whole animals for consecrated limbs or fetuses. One may infer from the mishna that <b>it is a substitution</b> of fetuses <b>that one cannot effect,</b> as the Torah states with regard to substitution: “And if he substitutes an animal for an animal” (Leviticus 27:10), and a fetus is not classified as an animal. But if one <b>consecrates</b> fetuses directly, not in the manner of substitution, they are <b>consecrated,</b> contrary to the opinion of bar Padda.

### Part 12
Rabbi Zeira <b>said to</b> him: The mishna <b>is</b> referring <b>to the offspring of sacrificial</b> animals that became pregnant after they were consecrated. That case is different, <b>as they are already consecrated</b> through their mothers. It does not indicate that one can consecrate a fetus directly.

### Part 13
Rabbi Yirmeya objected: <b>If</b> the mishna is referring to <b>the offspring of sacrificial</b> animals, and it is teaching that one does not substitute them because fetuses are not considered animals, one can infer that <b>it is</b> only when they are <b>in their mother’s womb that one cannot effect</b> substitution with them. But once they are <b>outside</b> their mother’s womb, i.e., once they are born, one can <b>effect</b> substitution with them. <b>But</b> this is not the case, as <b>isn’t it taught</b> in the next mishna (12a) that <b>the offspring</b> born of a consecrated animal that was not itself consecrated <b>does not render</b> a non-sacred animal exchanged for it <b>a substitute?</b>

### Part 14
Rabbi Zeira answered: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> first mishna? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who</b> disagreed with that ruling in the next mishna and <b>said</b> that <b>the offspring renders</b> a non-sacred animal exchanged for it <b>a substitute.</b>

### Part 15
Rabbi Yirmeya objected: <b>If</b> this mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> one encounters another difficulty. The mishna indicates that <b>it is substitution that one cannot perform</b> with consecrated limbs, as the sanctity of substitution does not extend to the entire animal. Consequently, if one <b>consecrates</b> limbs directly, they are <b>consecrated</b> and the sanctity extends to the whole animal. But <b>doesn’t Rabbi Yehuda say</b> that <b>limbs are not consecrated</b> in this manner, that the sanctity extends to the whole animal? Rabbi Zeira <b>said</b> him: <b>What are we dealing with here? With a limb upon which</b> the animal’s <b>life depends.</b> Rabbi Yehuda’s ruling that limbs cannot be consecrated applies only to non-vital organs, e.g., legs. He concedes that vital organs are consecrated and the consecration extends to the entire animal.

### Part 16
Rabbi Yirmeya <b>raised</b> another <b>objection to</b> bar Padda’s opinion: A later mishna (16b) lists stringencies that apply to sacrificial animals but not to substitutes: <b>One consecrates</b> an animal’s <b>limbs and fetuses</b> in utero, <b>but one does not substitute</b> non-sacred animals for them. This contradicts bar Padda’s opinion that one cannot consecrate fetuses. Rabbi Zeira answered: <b>Here too,</b> the mishna is referring <b>to the offspring of sacrificial</b> animals that became pregnant after they were consecrated.

### Part 17
Rabbi Yirmeya objected: <b>If</b> the mishna is referring <b>to the offspring of sacrificial</b> animals, <b>what</b> is the meaning of the term: <b>One consecrates?</b> After all, these offspring <b>are already consecrated</b> through their mothers.
