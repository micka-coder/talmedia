### Part 1
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a rapist who</b> married and then <b>divorced</b> his victim, <b>if he is an Israelite,</b> who is permitted to marry a divorcée, <b>he remarries</b> her <b>and he is not flogged. And if you say,</b> like Rava, that <b>since one violates the statement of the Merciful One, he is flogged, this one should be flogged as well</b> for divorcing his victim. But according to the opinion of Abaye, it stands to reason that he should not be flogged, since his remarriage nullifies the effects of the divorce. This should be <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rava.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara answers that Rava could <b>say to you:</b> It <b>is different there, as the verse states:</b> “He may not send her away <b>all his days”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:29). This teaches that for <b>all his days,</b> he remains <b>under</b> the obligation to <b>arise and remarry</b> her. Once he remarries her, it turns out that he did not divorce her for all of his days and therefore did not violate the prohibition. This is why he is not flogged.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Abaye,</b> what is derived from the phrase “all his days”? The Gemara answers: <b>If the Merciful One did not state “all his days,” I would say</b> that <b>he has violated a prohibition</b> by divorcing her, and that <b>if he desires</b> he may choose <b>to remarry</b> her, <b>and if he</b> so <b>desires</b> he may choose <b>not to remarry</b> her. The phrase “all his days” <b>teaches us</b> that he is obligated to remarry her.

### Part 4
The Gemara records <b>another version</b> of the discussion, in which it <b>raises an objection</b> from the <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a rapist who</b> married and then <b>divorced</b> his victim, <b>if he is an Israelite, he remarries</b> her <b>and he is not flogged. But if he is a priest, he is flogged and he does not remarry</b> her. The <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that <b>if he is an Israelite he remarries</b> her and he is not flogged, indicating that he must take her back because his divorce was not effective. This is apparently <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Abaye,</b> who holds that transgressions are legally effective.

### Part 5
The Gemara answers that it <b>is different there, as the Merciful One states:</b> “He may not send her away <b>all his days”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:29), which teaches that for <b>all his days,</b> he remains <b>under</b> the obligation to <b>arise and remarry</b> her. Therefore, it is only in this specific case that the divorce is not effective.

### Part 6
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rava,</b> he could <b>say to you</b> that <b>if the Merciful One had not stated “all his days,” I would say</b> that the Israelite <b>should be flogged and should</b> still <b>remarry</b> her, <b>for it is solely a prohibition</b> that he has violated, <b>as it is written: He may not send her away. Therefore, the verse writes “all his days,” to render</b> the case of <b>a rapist a prohibition</b> whose violation can be <b>rectified by</b> fulfilling <b>a positive mitzva, for which one is not flogged.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara objects: <b>But there is</b> the case of one who <b>separates <i>teruma</i> from poor-quality</b> produce <b>for superior-quality</b> produce, i.e., he separated <i>teruma</i> from the inferior produce in order to fulfill the obligation of separating <i>teruma</i> from other produce that is high-quality. This is prohibited, <b>as the Merciful One states:</b> “Out of all that is given you, you shall set apart all of that which is due to the Lord, <b>of all the best thereof”</b> (Numbers 18:29).

### Part 8
And the Sages interpret this verse as follows: “Of all <b>the best thereof,” yes,</b> but one should <b>not</b> separate <b>poor-quality</b> produce. <b>And</b> yet <b>we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 2:4): <b>One may not separate <i>teruma</i> from poor-quality</b> produce <b>for superior-quality</b> produce, <b>and if one did separate <i>teruma</i></b> in that manner, <b>his <i>teruma</i> is</b> valid <b><i>teruma</i>. Apparently,</b> his action <b>is effective,</b> which is apparently <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rava.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara explains that <b>Rava</b> could <b>say to you: It is different there, in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Ile’a. As Rabbi Ile’a said: From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to one who separates <i>teruma</i> from poor-quality</b> produce <b>for superior-quality</b> produce <b>that his <i>teruma</i> is</b> valid <b><i>teruma</i>? As it is stated</b> with regard to <i>teruma</i>: <b>“And you shall bear no sin by reason of it, seeing that you have set apart from it the best thereof”</b> (Numbers 18:32). The verse defines separation from inferior produce as a transgression but teaches that it is nevertheless effective, because <b>if it is not consecrated</b> as <i>teruma</i>, <b>why</b> would one <b>bear a sin</b> for accomplishing nothing? <b>From here</b> it is derived <b>with regard to one who separates <i>teruma</i> from poor-quality</b> produce <b>for superior-quality</b> produce <b>that his <i>teruma</i> is</b> valid <b><i>teruma</i>.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Abaye,</b> that all transgressions are legally effective, what does the phrase “And you shall bear no sin by reason of it” teach? The Gemara answers: <b>If the Merciful One had not stated: “And you shall bear no sin by reason of it,” I would say</b> that <b>this is what the Merciful One said: Perform the mitzva in the optimal</b> manner by separating <i>teruma</i> from superior-quality produce, <b>but if one did not perform</b> the mitzva in that manner, <b>he is not called a sinner.</b> The verse <b>teaches us</b> that one who fails to perform this mitzva in the optimal manner sins.

### Part 11
The Gemara objects: <b>But isn’t there</b> the case of one who separates <i>teruma</i> <b>from</b> one <b>type</b> of produce <b>to</b> exempt <b>another type</b> of produce, <b>as the Merciful One states: “All the best of the oil,</b> and all the best of the wine, and of the grain, the first part of them which they give to the Lord” (Numbers 18:12)? This teaches that one is obligated <b>to give the best of one</b> type of produce <b>and the best of another</b> type of produce, each individually. <b>And we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 2:4): <b>One may not separate <i>teruma</i> from</b> one <b>type</b> of produce <b>for another type, and if one did separate <i>teruma</i></b> in that manner, <b>his <i>teruma</i> is not</b> valid <b><i>teruma</i>. Apparently,</b> the transgression <b>is not effective.</b> This is apparently <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Abaye.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara answers that <b>Abaye</b> could <b>say to you:</b> It <b>is different there, as the verse</b> repeats this prohibition and <b>states: “The first part of them,”</b> indicating that one must give <b>a first part for this</b> type of produce <b>and a first part for that</b> type of produce. If the verse had not taught so explicitly in this case, one would have assumed that the transgression is effective. <b>And Rabbi Ile’a likewise says</b> that the phrase in the verse <b>“the first part</b> of them” is the exception that proves the rule.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rava,</b> that transgressions are not effective, what does the term “the first part of them” teach? The Gemara answers: <b>If the Merciful One had not stated: “The first part</b> of them,” <b>I would say</b> that the prohibition applies only to <b>wine and</b> olive <b>oil, with regard to which it is written: “Best…best,”</b> teaching <b>that one may not separate <i>teruma</i> from this</b> type <b>for that</b> type.

### Part 14
<b>But</b> as for <b>wine and grain,</b> or one type of <b>grain and</b> another type of <b>grain, with regard to which</b> the term <b>“best” is written</b> only <b>once, when one separates <i>teruma</i> from this</b> grain or wine <b>for that</b> grain or wine, he is not held liable for transgressing Torah law, and <b>he is not flogged.</b> Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes: “The first part</b> of them,” to teach that one must <b>give the best of this and the best of that.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara records <b>another version</b> of the last point: But as for <b>wine and grain, with regard to which</b> the term <b>“best” is written</b> only <b>once, one may separate <i>teruma</i> from this for that</b> <i>ab initio</i>. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes: “The first part</b> of them,” to teach that even in the case of wine and grain, one may not separate <i>teruma</i> from one for the other.

### Part 16
The Gemara objects: <b>But there is</b> the case of <b>dedications</b> of property to the priests, with regard to <b>which the Merciful One states: “No</b> devoted item, that a man may devote unto the Lord of all that he has, whether of man or animal, or of the field of his possession, <b>shall be sold or redeemed;</b> every devoted item is most holy unto the Lord” (Leviticus 27:28). <b>And we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Arakhin</i> 28b): <b>Items dedicated to priests are not redeemed; rather, one gives them to the priest. Apparently,</b> if one transgresses the prohibition and redeems a dedicated item, his action <b>is not effective.</b> This seems to be <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Abaye.</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara explains that Abaye could <b>say to you: It is different there, as the Merciful One states: “Is most holy,”</b> to teach that <b>it shall be as it is.</b> Once it is dedicated, its status cannot be changed by means of redemption. But in other matters the transgression is effective.
