### Part 1
“Either a bull or a lamb that has anything too long or too short, <b>that may you offer for a gift;</b> but for a vow it shall not be accepted” (Leviticus 22:23). <b>This</b> verse teaches that only blemished animals may be <b>consecrated</b> for <b>Temple maintenance. And we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who consecrates unblemished</b> animals for <b>Temple maintenance, even though he has</b> transgressed <b>a prohibition, what he did is done.</b> This is apparently <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rava.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara explains that <b>Rava</b> could <b>say to you: From the</b> same <b>place</b> that it was derived earlier <b>that blemished</b> animals <b>are included,</b> i.e., that their consecration <b>for</b> sacrifice <b>on the altar</b> is effective after the fact, it is likewise derived that <b>unblemished</b> animals <b>are included,</b> that their consecration <b>for Temple maintenance</b> is effective. But in general, transgressions are not effective.

### Part 3
The Gemara objects: <b>But there is</b> the case of <b>robbery,</b> with regard to <b>which the Merciful One states:</b> “You shall not oppress you neighbor, and <b>you shall not rob</b> him” (Leviticus 19:13), <b>and we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Kamma</i> 93b): <b>One who robs</b> another of <b>wood and fashions it</b> into <b>vessels,</b> or one who robs another of <b>wool and fashions it</b> into <b>garments, pays</b> the victim <b>according to</b> the value of the goods at <b>the time of the robbery,</b> but he need not return the vessels or garments, since by changing the stolen items he acquired them. If he can acquire the stolen item, this is apparently <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rava.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara explains that <b>Rava</b> could <b>say to you: It is different there, as the verse states:</b> “He shall restore the stolen item <b>that he took by robbery”</b> (Leviticus 5:23). This teaches that he must return the original item only if it is still <b>like</b> that <b>which he took by robbery</b> and has not been altered. But in general, transgressions are not effective.

### Part 5
<b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Abaye, this</b> phrase: <b>“That he took by robbery,” is necessary</b> to teach that one who takes a false oath denying he robbed another, who must then pay an additional fifth of the value of the stolen item when he returns it, need <b>add a fifth</b> only <b>for</b> denying <b>his</b> own act of <b>robbery,</b> but <b>for</b> denying <b>his</b> deceased <b>father’s</b> act of <b>robbery</b> when sued by the victim as the robber’s heir, he need <b>not add</b> an additional <b>fifth.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara objects: <b>But there is</b> the case of <b>collateral,</b> with regard to <b>which the Merciful One states:</b> “When you lend your neighbor any manner of loan, <b>you shall not go into his house to fetch his pledge”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:10), teaching that a creditor may not seize collateral if the debtor delays payment. <b>And we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 113a): If the creditor nevertheless seized two items as collateral, <b>he returns a mattress by night,</b> as the debtor requires it for sleeping, <b>and a plow,</b> which is needed for his daytime work, <b>by day.</b> The creditor may keep possession of seized collateral when it is not being used, which is apparently <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rava.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara explains that <b>Rava</b> could <b>say to you: It is different there, as the verse states:</b> “And if he be a poor man, you shall not sleep with his pledge; <b>you shall restore [<i>hashev tashiv</i>]</b> to him the pledge” (Deuteronomy 24:12–13). The repetition of the verb teaches that the creditor must return the collateral many times, e.g., he must return a plow each morning and take it back each night, and return a mattress each night and take it back each morning, but he does not have to return the collateral permanently. But in general, transgressions are not effective.

### Part 8
The Gemara notes: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Abaye,</b> that transgressions are generally effective, the repetition of the verb may be explained as follows: <b>If the Merciful One had not stated: “<i>Hashev tashiv</i>,” I would say</b> that a creditor who seizes collateral from the home of the debtor has <b>performed a prohibition,</b> but having done so, <b>if he desires, he may return</b> the collateral, <b>and if he desires, he may not return</b> it. The verse therefore <b>teaches us</b> that he must return the items the debtor needs.

### Part 9
The Gemara objects: <b>But there is</b> the case of <b>produce in the corner of the field, which is given to the poor [<i>pe’a</i>],</b> with regard to <b>which the Merciful One stated:</b> And when you reap the harvest of your land, <b>you shall not wholly reap the corner of your field”</b> (Leviticus 23:22), but one must leave a corner of the field for the poor. <b>And we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Pe’a</i> 1:5): The optimal way to fulfill <b>the mitzva of <i>pe’a</i></b> is for the owner <b>to separate</b> it <b>from the standing</b> grain, i.e., grain that has not been harvested. If <b>he did not separate</b> it <b>from the standing</b> grain, <b>he separates</b> it <b>from the sheaves</b> of grain that have already been harvested. If <b>he did not separate</b> it <b>from the sheaves, he separates</b> it <b>from the pile</b> of grain, <b>as long as he has not</b> yet <b>smoothed</b> the pile.

### Part 10
The <i>baraita</i> continues: Once <b>he smooths</b> the pile of grain, it becomes obligated in tithes. Therefore, <b>he</b> must first <b>tithe</b> the grain <b>and</b> then <b>give</b> a portion of the produce <b>to</b> the poor as <i>pe’a</i>, so that the poor need not tithe what they receive. Additionally, the Sages <b>said in the name of Rabbi Yishmael:</b> If he did not separate <i>pe’a</i> during any of these stages, and he milled the grain and kneaded it into dough, <b>he separates</b> <i>pe’a</i> <b>even from the dough</b> and gives it to the poor. Even if the owner harvested the grain, the <i>pe’a</i> is still not considered his, which is apparently <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Abaye.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara explains that <b>Abaye</b> could <b>say to you: It is different there, as the verse states: “You shall leave</b> them for the poor and for the stranger” (Leviticus 19:10), and subsequently, it again states: <b>“You shall leave</b> them for the poor and for the stranger” (Leviticus 23:22). The <b>superfluous</b> phrase teaches that the owner must give <i>pe’a</i> in any event, even if he harvests the grain and kneads it into dough. But in general, transgressions are effective.

### Part 12
<b>And Rava,</b> who maintains that in general transgressions are not effective, could <b>say to you</b> that the extra verse teaches that <b>there is another</b> type of <b>leaving</b> over one’s grain <b>that is like this. And what is that? It is</b> the case of <b>one who renounces ownership of his vineyard.</b>

### Part 13
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one renounced ownership of his vineyard,</b> thereby exempting it from tithes and gifts to the poor, <b>and he rose early in the morning,</b> retook possession of it, <b>and harvested it, he is</b> still <b>obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>individual fallen</b> grapes left for the poor <b>[<i>peret</i>], and</b> in the mitzva of <b>incompletely formed clusters</b> of grapes left for the poor <b>[<i>olelot</i>],</b> and <b>in</b> the mitzva of <b>forgotten</b> clusters of grapes left for the poor, <b>and in</b> the mitzva of <b><i>pe’a</i>, but he</b> remains <b>exempt from the</b> mitzva to <b>tithe</b> his produce. His obligation to give the gifts to the poor even though the vineyard was at some point ownerless is derived from the repeated phrase: “You shall leave them for the poor.”

### Part 14
§ <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: And now that we have given all of these answers,</b> explaining that Abaye and Rava concede to one another in all the above cases, <b>with regard to what</b> cases do <b>Abaye and Rava disagree?</b>

### Part 15
Rav Ashi answered: <b>They disagree with regard to fixed [<i>ketzutza</i>] interest, and</b> their dispute is <b>like</b> that <b>of Rabbi Elazar</b> and Rabbi Yoḥanan. <b>As Rabbi Elazar said:</b> If a debtor paid <b>fixed interest</b> and petitions the court to have it returned to him, since the Torah prohibits the charging of interest, it <b>is repossessed</b> from the creditor <b>by</b> the <b>judges</b> of the court.
