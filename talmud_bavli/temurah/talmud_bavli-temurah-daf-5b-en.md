### Part 1
<b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rava, this</b> term: <b>“Is</b> most holy,” serves <b>to exclude</b> the case of <b>a firstborn</b> offering from the prohibition of sale. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>It is stated with regard to a firstborn</b> offering: “But the firstling of an ox, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, <b>you shall not redeem;</b> they are holy” (Numbers 18:17). <b>But</b> if it develops a blemish <b>it</b> may still be <b>sold.</b> By contrast, <b>it is stated with regard to</b> the animal <b>tithe</b> offering: <b>“It shall not be redeemed”</b> (Leviticus 27:33), <b>and</b> the animal tithe may <b>not be sold, not</b> when <b>alive and not</b> when <b>slaughtered, not</b> when <b>unblemished and not</b> when <b>blemished.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara objects: <b>But isn’t there</b> the case of <b>substitution,</b> with regard to <b>which the Merciful One states: “He shall not exchange it, nor substitute it”</b> (Leviticus 27:10), <b>and it is taught</b> in the mishna (2a): That is <b>not</b> to say <b>that it is permitted for a person to effect substitution; rather,</b> it means <b>that if one substituted</b> a non-sacred animal for a consecrated animal, <b>the substitution takes effect, and</b> the one who substituted the non-sacred animal <b>incurs the forty</b> lashes. <b>Apparently,</b> his action <b>is effective,</b> and this seems to be <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rava.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara explains that Rava could <b>say to you: It is different there, as</b> that same <b>verse states:</b> “And if he shall at all substitute animal for animal, then <b>both it and that for which it is substituted shall be holy,”</b> which teaches that his action is effective in this context specifically.

### Part 4
<b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Abaye,</b> that transgressions are effective in general, that clause is still necessary, because <b>if the Merciful One had not stated: “Both it and that for which it is substituted</b> shall be holy,” <b>I would say</b> that <b>this</b> initially consecrated animal <b>will leave</b> its consecrated state, <b>and that</b> non-sacred animal <b>will enter</b> into sanctity instead. Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that the first animal retains its sanctity as well.

### Part 5
The Gemara objects: <b>But isn’t there</b> the case of <b>a firstborn</b> offering, with regard to <b>which the Merciful One states:</b> “But the firstling of an ox, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, <b>you shall not redeem;</b> they are holy” (Numbers 18:17)? <b>And we learned</b> in a mishna (21a): All sacrificial animals that became blemished <b>are subject to redemption</b> through sale, <b>and their substitutes</b> are also subject <b>to redemption</b> through sale, <b>except for the firstborn and the</b> animal <b>tithe</b> offerings. <b>Apparently,</b> if one attempts to redeem a firstborn offering, his action <b>is not effective,</b> and this seems to be <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Abaye.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara explains that Abaye could <b>say to you: It is different there, as</b> that same <b>verse states: “They are</b> holy,” thereby teaching that <b>they shall</b> always <b>be as they are,</b> even if one attempts to redeem them.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Rava,</b> who maintains that transgressions are not effective, <b>why does he</b> need the term <b>“They are</b> holy”? The Gemara answers: This term teaches that if one substituted another animal for a firstborn offering or for an animal tithe offering, <b>they,</b> the originally consecrated animals, <b>are sacrificed, but their substitutes,</b> although they have sanctity, <b>are not sacrificed.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Abaye, from where does he</b> derive <b>this conclusion</b> that the substitutes are not sacrificed? The Gemara answers: The verse states concerning firstborn offerings: <b>“Whether it be ox or sheep, it is the Lord’s”</b> (Leviticus 27:26). One can infer from this wording that it <b>is sacrificed to the Lord but its substitute is not sacrificed.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what does <b>Rava</b> derive from that verse? The Gemara responds: <b>Yes,</b> it <b>is indeed so that</b> he, like Abaye, derives <b>from that verse,</b> not from Numbers 18:17 as originally suggested, the <i>halakha</i> <b>that</b> the substitute of a firstborn is not sacrificed. <b>Rather, why do I</b> need the term <b>“They are</b> holy” which appears in that verse? It <b>teaches with regard to a firstborn</b> offering <b>or</b> an animal <b>tithe</b> offering <b>whose blood was mixed with</b> the blood of <b>any</b> other offering <b>brought upon</b> the altar <b>that</b> the blood <b>is</b> nevertheless <b>sacrificed on the altar</b> as it would have been individually.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>And Abaye, from where does he</b> derive <b>this conclusion,</b> that such blood is sacrificed? The Gemara answers: He derives it <b>from</b> the verse concerning the High Priest’s service on Yom Kippur: <b>“And he shall take of the blood of the bull, and of the blood of the goat,</b> and put it upon the corners of the altar” (Leviticus 16:18). One might ask: <b>But isn’t there more blood of the bull than of the goat?</b> Why is the blood of the goat not nullified? <b>From here</b> it is derived <b>that</b> offerings <b>brought upon</b> the altar <b>do not nullify one another, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the phrase in the verse <b>“And he shall take of the blood of the bull, and of the blood of the goat”</b> serves to teach <b>that they must be mixed.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yoshiya.</b> Accordingly, Abaye derives that mixtures of blood may be sacrificed.

### Part 11
<b>And</b> as for <b>Rava,</b> he holds that <b>there,</b> the High Priest would take <b>from this</b> blood of the bull <b>by itself and from that</b> blood of the goat <b>by itself,</b> rather than mixing them together. <b>And</b> in this matter, <b>he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yonatan,</b> who disagrees with Rabbi Yoshiya.

### Part 12
The Gemara continues its analysis of the dispute between Abaye and Rava. <b>But isn’t there</b> the case of <b>an animal tithe</b> offering, with regard to <b>which the Merciful One states: “It shall not be redeemed”</b> (Leviticus 27:33)? <b>And we learned</b> in a mishna (21a): All sacrificial animals that became blemished <b>are subject to redemption</b> through sale, <b>and their substitutes</b> are also subject to redemption through sale, <b>except for the firstborn and the</b> animal <b>tithe</b> offering. <b>Apparently,</b> if one attempts to redeem an animal tithe offering, his act <b>is not effective,</b> and this seems to be <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Abaye.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara explains that Abaye could <b>say to you: It is different there, as one derives</b> that <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of a firstborn offering, by verbal analogy between the term <b>“<i>avara</i>”</b> that is stated with regard to an animal tithe offering: “Whatsoever passes [<i>ya’avor</i>] under the rod” (Leviticus 27:32), and the term <b>“<i>avara</i>”</b> that is stated with regard to <b>a firstborn</b> offering: “You shall set apart [<i>veha’avarta</i>] to the Lord all that opens the womb” (Exodus 13:12). It was already derived above that a firstborn offering cannot be redeemed. But in general, transgressions are effective.

### Part 14
The Gemara objects: But <b>isn’t there</b> the case of one who separated <b><i>teruma</i> prior to the</b> separation of the <b>first fruits,</b> with regard to <b>which the Merciful One states: “You shall not delay to offer of the fullness of your harvest and the outflow of your presses”</b> (Exodus 22:28)? The verse was expounded earlier (4b) as teaching that one must separate first fruits before separating <i>teruma</i>. <b>And we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 3:6): If <b>one</b> separates <i>teruma</i> <b>prior</b> to the separation of the first fruits, <b>although he has</b> transgressed <b>a prohibition, what he did is done,</b> and produce has the status of <i>teruma</i>. This appears to refute the opinion of Rava.

### Part 15
The Gemara explains that <b>Rava</b> could <b>say to you: It is different there, as the verse states: “From all that is given you, you shall set apart</b> that which is the Lord’s <b><i>teruma</i>”</b> (Numbers 18:29), thereby teaching that the separation of <i>teruma</i> is effective in any case. But in general, transgressions are not effective.

### Part 16
<b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Abaye</b> that transgressions are generally effective, that verse <b>is required</b> to teach another <i>halakha</i>, <b>as Rav Pappa said to Abaye</b> (<i>Beitza</i> 13b): Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish stated that if the first tithe was separated while the grain was still on the stalks, that amount is exempt from <i>teruma</i>, even though the amount of <i>teruma</i> the priest receives is thereby reduced. <b>If that is so,</b> then <b>even</b> if the Levite <b>preceded</b> the priest by taking the first tithe after the grain had been threshed and arranged <b>in a pile, we should exempt</b> that grain from the obligation of <i>teruma</i> <b>as well.</b>

### Part 17
Abaye <b>said to</b> Rav Pappa: <b>With regard to your</b> claim, <b>the verse states: “From all that is given you, you shall set apart.”</b> This verse teaches that the Levites must designate a portion of all the gifts they receive and give it to the priests, even if they received them before <i>teruma</i> had been separated.

### Part 18
Rav Pappa asked: <b>What did you see</b> that leads you <b>to include</b> the first tithe taken from <b>the pile</b> in the category: “All that is given,” <b>and to exclude</b> that which is taken from <b>the stalks?</b> Abaye answered: <b>I include</b> a tithe taken from <b>the pile, as</b> it has been processed to the point where <b>it is included in the category of grain,</b> since it is written: “The first fruits of your grain…you shall give him” (Deuteronomy 18:4); <b>and I exclude</b> a tithe taken from <b>the stalks, as</b> it <b>is not included in the category of grain</b> and is not yet obligated in <i>teruma</i>.

### Part 19
The Gemara objects: <b>But isn’t there</b> the case of <b>a widow</b> betrothed <b>to a High Priest,</b> with regard to <b>which the Merciful One stated: “A widow, or one divorced,</b> or a profaned woman, or a harlot, these <b>shall he not take;</b> but a virgin of his own people shall he take to wife. And he shall not profane his seed among his people” (Leviticus 21:14–15)? <b>And we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kiddushin</i> 66b): <b>Any case where there is</b> a valid <b>betrothal and</b> yet <b>there is a transgression, the offspring follows the flawed</b> lineage. For example, if a widow, who may not marry a High Priest, nevertheless did so, the offspring may not marry a priest. Still, the marriage is in force, contrary to the opinion of Rava.

### Part 20
The Gemara explains that Rava could say: <b>It is different there, as the verse states:</b> “And <b>he shall not profane [<i>lo yeḥallel</i>] his seed.”</b> The verse states only that the offspring is profaned, not that he has the status of a <i>mamzer</i>, which would hold for one born of a union between two people with regard to whom marriage cannot take effect. Rava infers from the verse that the betrothal of a High Priest and a widow specifically does take effect. But in general, transgressions are not effective.

### Part 21
<b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Abaye,</b> that transgressions are generally effective, what is derived from that phrase? Abaye can say: If it merely means to teach that the betrothal takes effect, <b>let the verse state</b> simply: <b><i>Lo yaḥel</i>,</b> which would have the same meaning. <b>What</b> is indicated by the use of the longer form: <b><i>Lo yeḥallel</i>?</b> This teaches that there are two profanations: <b>One for him,</b> i.e., that the offspring is profaned, <b>and one for her,</b> i.e., that the mother is disqualified from marrying even a common priest.

### Part 22
The Gemara objects: <b>But isn’t there</b> the case of one who <b>consecrated blemished</b> animals <b>for</b> sacrifice on <b>the altar,</b> with regard to <b>which the Merciful One states:</b> “But <b>whatsoever has a blemish, that you shall not bring;</b> for it shall not be acceptable for you” (Leviticus 22:20)? <b>And we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one consecrates blemished</b> animals <b>for</b> sacrifice <b>on the altar, even though he has</b> transgressed <b>a prohibition, what he did is done,</b> and the consecration takes effect. This is apparently <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rava.</b>

### Part 23
The Gemara explains that <b>Rava</b> could <b>say to you: It is different there, as the verse states</b> with regard to blemished animals: <b>“But for a vow it shall not be accepted”</b> (Leviticus 22:23). Since the verse specifies only <b>that it is</b> its sacrifice <b>which does not effect acceptance,</b> one may <b>consequently</b> infer that if one <b>consecrates</b> them, <b>they are</b> still <b>consecrated.</b> But in general, transgressions are not effective.

### Part 24
<b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Abaye,</b> that transgressions are generally effective, what does this phrase teach? Abaye can say that <b>if the Merciful One had not stated: “But for a vow it shall not be accepted,” I would say</b> that one who consecrated it is considered <b>like</b> one who <b>transgressed a mitzva but</b> the offering is still <b>fit</b> to be sacrificed. The verse therefore <b>teaches us</b> that it may not be sacrificed as an offering.

### Part 25
The Gemara objects: <b>But there is</b> the case of one who <b>consecrates unblemished</b> animals <b>for Temple maintenance,</b> with regard to <b>which the Merciful One states:</b>
