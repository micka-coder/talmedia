### Part 1
<b>Or perhaps</b> we say that if one redeems <b>any</b> animal that possesses the <b>same sanctity</b> as the original <b>he does not add</b> an additional <b>one-fifth.</b>

### Part 2
<b>And if you say</b> that with regard to <b>this other body, since it maintains the same</b> type of <b>sanctity</b> as the initial animal, one <b>does not add one-fifth</b> when redeeming it, <b>but</b> what of a case where the first animal was lost and the owner <b>achieved atonement by</b> bringing <b>another, and this</b> first animal was found and <b>was consigned to</b> be sacrificed as <b>a burnt offering? What is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Do we say that <b>when</b> one <b>does not add</b> an additional <b>one-fifth,</b> that is only <b>with regard to the same body with the same</b> type of <b>sanctity, but</b> in the case <b>of another</b> type of <b>sanctity</b> the exemption does <b>not</b> apply? <b>Or perhaps</b> we say that <b>since it is the same body,</b> one <b>does not add one-fifth.</b> The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 3
<b>Rami bar Ḥama raises a dilemma:</b> If one person consecrates his animal to be used as an offering by another, does the <b>one who consecrates</b> it <b>add one-fifth</b> when he redeems it, <b>or</b> does the <b>one atoning</b> by means of the offering <b>add one-fifth?</b> Who is considered the owner of the offering? <b>Rava said</b> that <b>the verse states: “And if he that consecrated it will redeem his house,</b> then he shall add the fifth part of the money” (Leviticus 27:15). It may be inferred from here that only the <b>one who consecrates</b> the item adds one-fifth, <b>but not</b> the <b>one for whom</b> the offering <b>atones.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rami bar Ḥama raises a dilemma:</b> If one person consecrates an animal to be used as an offering by another, can the <b>one who consecrates</b> it <b>render</b> another animal <b>a substitute</b> for it, <b>or</b> can the <b>one achieving atonement</b> through it <b>render a substitute</b> for it? <b>Rava said: If</b> it were <b>so,</b> that the one who consecrates it can render a substitute for it, <b>we</b> would <b>find</b> a case where the <b>community or partners can render a substitute</b> for their consecrated animal, <b>for example where they appointed an agent to consecrate</b> an animal for them. The mishna (13a) states that one cannot substitute for consecrated animals belonging to the community or to partners. By contrast, in this case, since only one person consecrated it, he would be able to substitute for it, contrary to the mishna.

### Part 5
<b>And furthermore, Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rav Huna says:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “This is the law of the nazirite who vows, <b>and of his offering unto the Lord for his naziriteship, besides that for which his means suffice;</b> according to his vow which he vows” (Numbers 6:21). <b>But is</b> the offering of <b>a nazirite judged according to his means?</b> The offerings of a nazirite are fixed by the Torah. <b>How</b> is it possible to understand <b>this</b> clause: “Besides that for which his means suffice”? Rather, the clause <b>“his offering unto the Lord for his naziriteship”</b> is referring to a case <b>where he separated</b> an offering <b>from his own</b> animals, whereas the clause <b>“besides that for which his means suffice”</b> is referring to a case <b>where others separated</b> the offering <b>for him.</b> This teaches that designation by others is effective.

### Part 6
<b>With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> is this <i>baraita</i> stated? <b>If we say</b> that it is <b>with regard to the matter of atonement,</b> and it is teaching that a nazirite can atone even by means of an offering designated for him by others, isn’t it <b>obvious that</b> such an offering can <b>atone for him?</b> Once it is his offering, he can certainly use it. <b>Rather,</b> the ruling of this <i>baraita</i> must be stated <b>with regard to substitution, and this</b> is what it <b>is saying: Even</b> in a case <b>where others separated</b> the offering <b>for him,</b> he alone can <b>render a substitute</b> for it. <b>Conclude from</b> this verse that <b>we follow</b> the <b>one for whom</b> the offering <b>atones,</b> and only he can effect substitution for the offering.

### Part 7
The Gemara responds: The <i>baraita</i> is <b>not</b> referring <b>to substitution,</b> but to the matter of atonement. <b>And that which is difficult for you,</b> that it is obvious that the nazirite can atone by bringing an offering consecrated by another, as <b>they have given it to him as a gift,</b> this is in fact not obvious. <b>Had the Merciful One not included</b> an offering received from another by writing the clause <b>“besides that for which his means suffice,” I would say</b> that <b>it is a Torah edict</b> expressed in the term <b>“his offering,”</b> that a nazirite can <b>atone</b> only with an offering consecrated <b>from his own</b> animals, <b>but not</b> through one received <b>from</b> the animals <b>of others.</b> Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that he can atone even with an offering received from others.

### Part 8
Having failed to resolve Rami bar Ḥama’s dilemma, the Gemara asks: <b>What</b> halakhic conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about this</b> matter? The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from that <b>which Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> If <b>one consecrates</b> his animal as an offering for someone else’s atonement, and he subsequently redeems the animal, <b>he adds one-fifth</b> to its value as the owner. <b>But</b> only the <b>one for whom</b> the offering <b>atones</b> can <b>render a substitute</b> for it. This resolves the dilemma of Rami bar Ḥama.

### Part 9
Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement continues: And if one <b>separates <i>teruma</i> from his</b> produce <b>to</b> exempt the produce <b>of others,</b> so that the other’s produce will be permitted in consumption, the <b>benefit of discretion is his.</b> He is entitled to determine which priest receives the <i>teruma</i>. The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>The verse states:</b> “When you have made an end of tithing <b>all the tithe of your produce</b> in the third year, which is the year of tithing, <b>and have given</b> it to the Levite, to the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow” (Deuteronomy 26:12). This indicates that the one actually giving the produce chooses to whom to give it.

### Part 10
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One does not substitute</b> non-sacred <b>limbs for</b> consecrated <b>fetuses,</b> i.e., if one says that a certain limb of a non-sacred animal is substituted for a fetus in the womb of a consecrated animal, it is not consecrated. <b>And</b> likewise, one does <b>not</b> substitute non-sacred <b>fetuses for</b> consecrated <b>limbs. And</b> one substitutes <b>neither</b> non-sacred <b>limbs nor fetuses for whole</b> consecrated animals <b>nor</b> non-sacred <b>whole</b> animals <b>for</b> consecrated limbs or fetuses.

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Yosei says: One substitutes</b> non-sacred <b>limbs for whole</b> consecrated animals, <b>but not whole</b> animals <b>for</b> consecrated limbs. <b>Rabbi Yosei said: But isn’t</b> it so <b>with regard to sacrificial</b> animals, that if <b>one says: The</b> hind <b>leg of this</b> animal is <b>a burnt offering, the entire</b> animal is <b>a burnt offering? So too, when he says: The</b> non-sacred hind <b>leg of this</b> animal is <b>in exchange for that</b> animal, <b>the entire</b> animal is <b>a substitute in exchange for it.</b>

### Part 12
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It was stated</b> that <b>Bar Padda says: Fetuses are not imbued with sanctity</b> if one attempts to consecrate them for sacrifice, and <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Fetuses are imbued with sanctity.</b> The Gemara notes: <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan follows his</b> line of <b>reasoning</b> in this regard, <b>as Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> In the case of <b>one who consecrated a pregnant animal</b> as <b>a sin offering, and it</b> later <b>gave birth,</b> if <b>he wishes he may achieve atonement by</b> sacrificing the mother, and the offspring will be left to graze until it develops a blemish that renders it unfit, whereupon it will be sold and the money is used to purchase a gift burnt offering; and if <b>he wishes he may achieve atonement through</b> the animal’s <b>offspring,</b> and the mother will be left to graze until it develops a blemish.

### Part 13
The Gemara adds: <b>And</b> both statements of Rabbi Yoḥanan are <b>necessary,</b> despite the fact that both affirm that fetuses may be consecrated. <b>As, if</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan had <b>taught us</b> only <b>this first</b> case, of one who consecrates a fetus by itself, I might say that only <b>there</b> is the fetus imbued with sanctity, <b>as he consecrated</b>
