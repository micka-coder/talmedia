### Part 1
<b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: And Rabbi Elazar concedes</b> to the opinion of the Rabbis with regard to a case <b>where</b> one <b>designates a female</b> animal <b>for a guilt offering,</b> which is only brought from a male animal, <b>that its offspring is not sacrificed</b> as <b>a guilt offering.</b> The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious?</b> As <b>Rabbi Elazar states</b> that the offspring may be sacrificed <b>only if</b> one <b>designates a female</b> animal <b>for a burnt offering</b> and it gives birth, due to the fact <b>that there is burnt offering status</b> for a bird that is the same sex as <b>its mother. But with regard to</b> one who <b>designates a female</b> animal <b>as a guilt offering, where there is no guilt offering status for its mother, even Rabbi Elazar concedes that</b> its offspring <b>is not sacrificed</b> as <b>a guilt offering.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara answers that this statement is nevertheless necessary, for <b>if</b> Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, had <b>not informed us</b> of this <i>halakha</i>, <b>I would say</b> that <b>the reason</b> for the ruling <b>of Rabbi Elazar,</b> that one who designates a female animal for a burnt offering may sacrifice the offspring as a burnt offering, <b>is not due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> there is <b>burnt offering status</b> for a bird with the same sex <b>as its mother; rather</b> it is <b>because the offspring is fit as an offering,</b> as it is a male, <b>and this too,</b> the offspring of the female that was designated as a guilt offering, <b>is</b> likewise <b>fit as an offering,</b> as it is a male. Therefore, he <b>teaches us</b> that this offspring is not sacrificed even according to the opinion of Rabbi Elazar.

### Part 3
The Gemara objects: <b>If so,</b> that Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina’s ruling is necessary to exclude the possibility that Rabbi Elazar’s reason is that the offspring is suitable as an offering, then say the following: <b>Rather than teach us that the offspring</b> of a female designated as a guilt offering <b>is not sacrificed</b> as <b>a guilt offering, let him teach us</b> a more expansive ruling, <b>that its offspring is not sacrificed</b> as <b>a burnt offering,</b> despite the fact that the mother is left to graze until it becomes unfit, at which point it is sold, and the proceeds are used for the purchase of a burnt offering. <b>And</b> from that ruling one would know that <b>the same is true</b> that the offspring is not sacrificed <b>as a guilt offering.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara explains: <b>If he would teach us</b> that according to Rabbi Elazar the offspring is not sacrificed as <b>a burnt offering, I would say</b> that it is only as <b>a burnt offering that</b> the offspring <b>is not sacrificed, because he did not consecrate the mother</b> with the same type of <b>sanctity</b> for the sake of which <b>the fetus</b> would be sacrificed. This is because the mother was consecrated as a guilt offering whereas the offspring would have been sacrificed as a burnt offering. <b>But</b> with regard to the option of sacrificing the offspring as <b>a guilt offering,</b> when the offspring has the same type of sanctity as that with which the mother was consecrated, I might <b>say</b> that <b>the offspring is sacrificed as a guilt offering.</b> Therefore, he <b>teaches us</b> that it is not sacrificed as a guilt offering, even according to the opinion of Rabbi Elazar.

### Part 5
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who designates a female</b> animal <b>for a guilt offering,</b> which may be brought only from males, <b>it</b> is left to <b>graze until it becomes blemished and</b> then <b>it is sold, and he brings a guilt offering with</b> the <b>money</b> received for <b>its</b> sale. <b>And if</b> in the interim, he designated a male animal and <b>his guilt offering was</b> already <b>sacrificed,</b> so that a guilt offering is no longer needed, the <b>money</b> received for the sale of the blemished female <b>is allocated for</b> communal <b>gift offerings.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> Since a female is unfit to be sacrificed as a guilt offering, its halakhic status is like that of a blemished animal in the sense that it does not become inherently sacred; rather, its value alone becomes sacred. Therefore, <b>it may be sold without a blemish,</b> and a guilt offering is purchased with the money received for its sale.

### Part 7
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>And why do I</b> need to wait until the female animal that was designated as a guilt offering <b>becomes blemished</b> before it can be sold? <b>Let it be sold</b> immediately even without a blemish: <b>Since it is</b> a female and therefore <b>unfit for the matter</b> for which it was designated, <b>this is</b> the same thing as <b>a blemish.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: This is the reason</b> that the female animal may not be sold before it becomes blemished, <b>for we say</b> that <b>as sanctity</b> that inheres in its <b>value has descended on it,</b> therefore <b>inherent sanctity has descended on it as well.</b> Although it may not be sacrificed in any event, its inherent sanctity still mandates that it may not be sold until it becomes blemished. <b>Rava says: That is to say</b> that even if one <b>consecrated a male</b> animal with the intention of selling it and bringing a burnt offering or guilt offering with <b>the money</b> received for <b>its</b> sale, as it becomes sanctified with sanctity that inheres in its value, it also becomes <b>sanctified</b> with <b>inherent sanctity.</b> And as the animal is fit to be brought as a burnt offering or as a guilt offering, it is sacrificed.

### Part 9
It <b>was stated</b> that this issue is subject to a dispute of <i>amora’im</i>: If one <b>consecrated a male</b> animal with the intention of selling it and bringing a burnt offering or guilt offering with the <b>money</b> received for <b>its</b> sale, <b>Rav Kahana says</b> that it is <b>sanctified</b> with <b>inherent sanctity,</b> whereas <b>Rava says</b> that it <b>is not sanctified</b> with <b>inherent sanctity. But Rava</b> later <b>retracted</b> his statement and agreed with the opinion <b>of Rav Kahana, due to</b> the aforementioned statement of <b>Rav Yehuda</b> citing that which <b>Rav said,</b> that as the animal becomes sanctified with sanctity that inheres in its value, inherent sanctity also takes effect.

### Part 10
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> disagrees with the opinion of the Rabbis and <b>says</b> that a female animal that was designated as a guilt offering <b>may be sold without a blemish,</b> as it is unfit to be sacrificed as the offering for which it was designated, and this itself is considered a blemish. <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin said to Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> Why doesn’t Rabbi Shimon say that <b>as sanctity</b> that inheres in its <b>value has descended on it, inherent sanctity should descend on it as well,</b> and therefore it may not be sold until it becomes blemished?

### Part 11
Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to</b> Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin: <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as he says</b> with regard to <b>anything that is not fit itself</b> to be sacrificed upon the altar, that <b>inherent sanctity does not descend upon it. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a guilt offering</b> that should be sacrificed when it is <b>in its</b> first <b>year,</b> such as a guilt offering of a nazirite or of a leper, <b>but</b> the owner <b>brought it</b> when it was <b>in its second</b> year, or a guilt offering that should be sacrificed when it is <b>in its second</b> year, such as a guilt offering for robbery, for misuse of consecrated property, or for a designated maidservant, <b>and</b> the owner <b>brought it</b> when it was <b>in its</b> first <b>year,</b> the offering <b>is fit, but it does not satisfy the obligation of the owner</b> to bring a guilt offering, and he must bring another one.

### Part 12
<b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> that the offering is disqualified, as these offerings <b>themselves are not consecrated,</b> due to the fact that the proper time of their offering has either not yet arrived or has already passed. This indicates that Rabbi Shimon maintains that in such a case there is no inherent sanctity.

### Part 13
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> consider the case of one who consecrates an animal <b>whose time has not yet</b> arrived, e.g., an animal that is less than eight days old, <b>which is unfit</b> to be sacrificed, <b>and</b> yet <b>Rabbi Shimon said that it is sanctified</b> with regard to the prohibition against the slaughter of sacrificial animals outside the Temple courtyard. This proves that according to Rabbi Shimon, even an offering that is not fit to be sacrificed has inherent sanctity. The Gemara explains that an animal <b>whose time has not yet</b> arrived <b>is different, as it is fit</b> to be offered <b>tomorrow,</b> i.e., automatically at a later stage, and is therefore considered to be fit for an offering.

### Part 14
The Gemara objects: <b>If so,</b> that any animal which will be fit to be sacrificed when its time arrives is sanctified with inherent sanctity, the same should also apply to <b>a guilt offering</b> that should be offered when it is <b>in its second</b> year <b>but</b> the owner <b>brought it</b> to be sacrificed when it was <b>in its</b> first <b>year,</b> as it will be <b>fit</b> for sacrifice <b>in</b> another <b>year.</b> Why, then, doesn’t it have inherent sanctity according to Rabbi Shimon? <b>Rather, this is the reason of Rabbi Shimon in</b> the case of an animal <b>whose time has not yet</b> arrived, <b>as he derives it from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a firstborn.</b>

### Part 15
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon:</b> An animal <b>whose time has not yet</b> arrived <b>enters the pen to be tithed</b> together with the other animals. <b>And it is</b> considered in this regard to be <b>like a firstborn: Just as a firstborn is sanctified before the time</b> when <b>it</b> is fit to be sacrificed has arrived, i.e., immediately after birth, <b>and it is sacrificed after its time,</b> following the eighth day, <b>so too,</b> an animal <b>whose time has not yet</b> arrived <b>is sanctified before its time</b> has arrived <b>and is sacrificed after its time.</b>

### Part 16
§ The Gemara continues to discuss this dispute between Rabbi Shimon and the Rabbis: <b>The Sages taught</b> that <b>one who consecrates a female</b> animal <b>for his burnt offering</b>
