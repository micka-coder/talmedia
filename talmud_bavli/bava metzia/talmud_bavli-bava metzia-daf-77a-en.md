### Part 1
this is <b>the laborers’ loss,</b> as it is a consequence of their misfortune. But if <b>he did not survey his land the night before,</b> it is <b>the employer’s loss, and he gives them</b> the wages <b>of an idle laborer.</b>

### Part 2
<b>And Rava</b> further <b>said:</b> With regard to <b>this one who hires laborers to draw water</b> from a river or a trench to irrigate his field, <b>and rain fell,</b> so that he no longer needs laborers, this is <b>the laborers’ loss.</b> The employer does not need to pay them, as he could not have known ahead of time that this would happen. But if <b>the river comes</b> up and irrigates the field, this is <b>the employer’s loss,</b> as he should have taken this possibility into consideration. <b>And</b> therefore <b>he gives them</b> the wages <b>of an idle laborer.</b>

### Part 3
<b>And Rava says:</b> With regard to <b>this one who hires laborers to draw water</b> from a river or a trench to irrigate his field, <b>and</b> the flow of the part of <b>the river</b> used to irrigate the field <b>stopped midday,</b> the <i>halakha</i> depends on the circumstance. <b>If it is not prone to stopping,</b> this is <b>the laborers’ loss,</b> a consequence of their misfortune. If <b>it is prone to stopping,</b> then one acts in accordance with this consideration: <b>If</b> the workers are residents <b>of that city</b> and know that this might happen, it is <b>the laborers’ loss;</b> if the laborers are <b>not</b> residents <b>of that city</b> and are not aware that this is a likely occurrence, it is <b>the employer’s loss.</b>

### Part 4
<b>And Rava says:</b> With regard to <b>this one who hires laborers to</b> perform a specific <b>task and the task is completed by midday, if he has</b> another <b>task that is easier than</b> the first one, <b>he</b> may <b>give it to them. Alternatively,</b> if he has other work that is <b>similar to</b> the first one in difficulty, <b>he</b> may <b>assign it to them.</b> But if he has other work that is <b>more difficult than it, he may not assign</b> it <b>to them, and he gives them their full wages.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> must he pay them their full wages? <b>Let him pay them</b> for the additional time at most <b>as an idle laborer.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>When Rava said</b> his ruling in this case, he was referring <b>to workers [<i>be’akhlushei</i>] of Meḥoza, who become weak if they do not work.</b> These laborers were accustomed to steady, strenuous work, and therefore sitting idle was difficult, not enjoyable, for them.

### Part 6
§ <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: The court <b>appraises for them that which they have done. How so? If</b> the current wage for the part of the task they have done <b>was</b> now <b>worth six dinars,</b> a <i>sela</i> and a half, as the price for this assignment increased, there are two possibilities: One is that <b>he gives them a <i>sela</i>,</b> as originally agreed upon, since they do not forfeit their stipulated wages. The Gemara explains: <b>The Rabbis hold</b> that <b>the laborer is at an advantage,</b> and therefore even if the laborer reneges on the assignment, he does not lose everything.

### Part 7
The <i>baraita</i> states the second possibility: <b>Or they finish their work and take two <i>sela</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that this is the case? That is the sum they agreed on at the outset. The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to state this <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where the price of labor increased</b> during the day <b>and the laborers rebelled</b> and did not want to work anymore, <b>and the employer went and appeased them</b> and they agreed to finish their task. <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>they can say to him: When we were appeased,</b> it was <b>with the intent that you would increase our wage,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us that</b> the employer can <b>say to them:</b> I appeased you <b>with the intent that I would trouble myself for you</b> by providing you <b>with</b> superior <b>food and drink,</b> not that I would increase your wages.

### Part 8
The <i>baraita</i> further teaches that if they performed work worth <b>a <i>sela</i>, he gives them a <i>sela</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where</b> the price of <b>labor was inexpensive at the outset and he hired them for one dinar more</b> than accepted, <b>and ultimately the price of labor increased and</b> the going wage now <b>stands at</b> that rate of <b>one more dinar.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara elaborates: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>they</b> can <b>say to him:</b> You <b>offered us a dinar above</b> the going rate, so now too, <b>give us one more dinar</b> than the current rate, to counter this, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us that he</b> can <b>say to them: When I said to you</b> that I would add <b>one more dinar,</b> the reason was <b>that it was not clear with regard to you</b> that you would be willing to work for the lower wage, so I increased it. <b>Now it is clear with regard to you,</b> i.e., you agreed to a wage that was acceptable to you, and I do not intend to increase it further.

### Part 10
The <i>baraita</i> further teaches that <b>Rabbi Dosa says:</b> The court <b>appraises for them that which must</b> still <b>be done.</b> If the current wage for the part of the task they had not done <b>was worth six dinars,</b> i.e., he can find laborers who will complete it only for six dinars, which is equivalent to one and a half <i>sela</i>, there are two possibilities: One is that <b>he gives</b> the first laborers <b>a shekel,</b> which is equivalent to half a <i>sela</i>. The Gemara explains that Rabbi Dosa <b>holds</b> that the <b>laborer is at a disadvantage,</b> in accordance with the principle that whoever reneges is at a disadvantage.

### Part 11
§ The <i>baraita</i> states the second possibility: <b>Or they finish their work and take two <i>sela</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: Isn’t this <b>obvious?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where</b> the price of <b>labor decreased</b> midday <b>and the employer rebelled,</b> seeking to cancel the agreement, <b>and</b> the <b>laborers went and appeased him</b> so that he would let them continue their work. <b>Lest you say</b> that the employer <b>can say to them:</b> When I was appeased, that was <b>with the intent that you would decrease your wages for me,</b> therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us that</b> the laborers can <b>say to him:</b> When we spoke it was <b>with the intent that we will do improved work for you.</b>

### Part 12
The <i>baraita</i> further teaches that Rabbi Dosa said: And if the current wage for the part of the task they had not done was worth <b>a <i>sela</i>, he gives them a <i>sela</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious? Rav Huna, son of Rav Natan, said: No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where they reduced for him</b> the accepted price <b>by a dinar at the outset, and ultimately</b> the price of <b>labor decreased,</b> so that the standard wage became equal to the price they had agreed on.

### Part 13
Rav Huna, son of Rav Natan, elaborates: <b>Lest you say</b> that the employer can say to them: <b>You said to me</b> that you would accept wages of <b>a dinar less</b> than the market value, and therefore <b>a dinar less</b> that the standard wage is what <b>I will give you.</b> Consequently, Rabbi Dosa <b>teaches us that</b> the laborers can <b>say to him: When we said to you</b> that we would agree to <b>a dinar less,</b> that was when <b>it was not clear that you</b> would be willing to pay the higher wage, but <b>now it is clear that you</b> will agree, and therefore you cannot reduce our wages.

### Part 14
With regard to that same dispute in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>Rav said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Dosa.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rav</b> really <b>say that? But doesn’t Rav say</b> that <b>a laborer can renege from</b> his commitment <b>even at midday? And if you would say</b> that <b>there is a difference for Rabbi Dosa between hired</b> work <b>and contracted</b> work, as a hired laborer can renege but a contracted laborer cannot, <b>is there</b> really <b>a difference for him? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who hires a laborer, and at midday</b> the laborer <b>heard that</b> a relative <b>of his died</b> and he has to tend to the burial, <b>or if</b> the laborer <b>was gripped with fever</b> and could not continue to work, <b>if he is a hired laborer,</b>
