### Part 1
<b>And we also learned a case like this</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Orla</i> 1:4), <b>with regard to</b> the prohibition against eating <b>the fruit of a tree during the first three years after its planting [<i>orla</i>]:</b> In the case of <b>a tree that sprouts from the trunk and from the roots</b> of an old tree, its owner is <b>obligated in <i>orla</i>,</b> since it is considered like a new tree, and the <i>orla</i> years must be counted anew. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If it sprouts <b>from the trunk,</b> the owner is <b>exempt,</b> since it is considered like a branch of the old tree, but if it grows <b>from the roots,</b> the owner is <b>obligated.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> both cases <b>are necessary</b> to be stated although they are both based on the same principle. <b>As had</b> it <b>taught us</b> only the <b>first</b> <i>halakha</i>, that of ownership, one could say that it is only <b>with regard to this</b> case that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said</b> his ruling, <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> it pertains to <b>monetary matters, but with regard to <i>orla</i>, which is</b> a matter of <b>a prohibition,</b> one could <b>say</b> that <b>he concedes to Rabbi Meir. And if it was stated</b> only <b>with regard to this</b> case of <i>orla</i>, one could say that it is only <b>with regard to this</b> case that <b>Rabbi Meir said</b> his stringent ruling, <b>but with regard to that</b> case, one could <b>say</b> that <b>he concedes to Rabbi Yehuda.</b> It is therefore <b>necessary</b> to state both disputes.

### Part 3
ยง The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Shimon said: Any</b> vegetables <b>that the</b> owner of the <b>upper</b> garden <b>can stretch out</b> his hand and take, those vegetables are his, and the rest belong to the owner of the lower garden. In <b>the school of Rabbi Yannai they say: And</b> this is only so <b>provided that he does not force</b> himself, but simply stretches out his hand in the usual manner.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Anan, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Yirmeya, raised a dilemma:</b> If the owner of the upper garden can <b>reach its leaves, but</b> he <b>cannot reach its roots,</b> or if he can <b>reach its roots but</b> he <b>cannot reach its leaves, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Is the plant considered to be within his reach or not? No answer was found for this question, and the Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 5
<b>Efrayim the scribe, a student of Reish Lakish, says in the name of Reish Lakish:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon. They stated</b> this case <b>before</b> the Persian <b>King Shapur,</b> who expressed an interest in this legal issue, and <b>he said to them: Let us offer praise [<i>apiryon</i>] to Rabbi Shimon.</b> He too felt that this was the best resolution.
