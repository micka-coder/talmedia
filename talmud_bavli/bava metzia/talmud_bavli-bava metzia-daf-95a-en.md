### Part 1
<b>unless the verse specifies</b> that one is liable only where he curses both <b>together,</b> which it does not do in this case.

### Part 2
The Gemara answers: <b>You</b> can <b>even say</b> that Rabbi Natan’s derivation from the word “or” is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoshiya,</b> as <b>here,</b> in the verse concerning a borrower’s liability, there is <b>no need</b> for the word “or” <b>to divide</b> the cases. <b>What is the reason?</b> The fact that injury and death are alone sufficient to engender liability <b>is</b> based on <b>logical reasoning,</b> as follows: <b>What</b> difference does it make <b>to me</b> if <b>it is entirely killed,</b> and <b>what</b> difference does it make <b>to me</b> if <b>it is partially killed,</b> i.e., injured? Either way, the animal is not in the state in which it was borrowed, so the borrower is liable to compensate the owner.

### Part 3
§ The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive the liability <b>of a borrower</b> in a case of <b>theft or loss?</b>

### Part 4
<b>And if you would say: Let us derive it from</b> the fact that a borrower is liable if the animal entrusted to him was <b>injured or died,</b> because theft and loss are similar to injury and death in that they are cases of accidents, this derivation can be refuted. <b>What</b> is notable <b>about</b> a case where the animal was <b>injured or died?</b> It is notable in <b>that it is no</b> longer <b>possible to make an effort and bring</b> the animal back to its undamaged state, and so it is reasonable that the borrower is liable for such occurrences. <b>Shall you</b> also <b>say</b> this ruling <b>about</b> a case of <b>theft or loss, where it is</b> still <b>possible to make an effort</b> to locate <b>and bring</b> back the animal? Since the animal is still extant, perhaps the borrower should not be liable.

### Part 5
<b>Rather,</b> a borrower’s liability for theft and loss is derived <b>like that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: From the verse: <b>“And it is injured or dies”</b> (Exodus 22:13), <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that a borrower is liable if the animal is <b>injured or dies. From where</b> do I derive that he is liable in a case of <b>theft or loss? You can say</b> it is <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If a paid bailee, who is exempt from</b> liability in a case in which the animal is <b>injured or dies,</b> is nevertheless <b>liable in</b> a case of <b>theft or loss,</b> then with regard to <b>a borrower, who is liable</b> in a case in which the animal is <b>injured or dies, isn’t it logical that he should</b> also <b>be liable in</b> a case of <b>theft or loss? And this is an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>that has no refutation.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is added by the conclusion of the <i>baraita</i> that this is an <i>a fortiori</i> inference that <b>has no refutation?</b> The Gemara explains that the <i>baraita</i> anticipated the following rebuttal: <b>And if you would say</b> that the <i>a fortiori</i> inference <b>can be refuted</b> as follows: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about</b> the case of <b>a paid bailee?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> he <b>pays</b> the <b>double payment when</b> he takes a false oath <b>stating the claim</b> that the deposit was taken by <b>an armed bandit.</b> If so, can you derive a <i>halakha</i> from the case of a paid bailee to that of a borrower, who pays only the principal in such a case? It would appear that a borrower does not always bear a more severe level of liability, and the <i>a fortiori</i> inference is thereby undermined.

### Part 7
Anticipating this refutation, the <i>baraita</i> states that it is invalid because <b>even so,</b> the fact that <b>a borrower</b> is liable to pay <b>the principal</b> when he claims the deposit was taken by an armed bandit, without the ability to exempt himself by taking an oath, <b>is a greater</b> stringency than the fact that a paid bailee is liable for the double payment, but only if he takes a false oath to that effect. Consequently, a borrower has a more severe level of liability, and the <i>a fortiori</i> inference is valid.

### Part 8
Alternatively, <b>if you wish, say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> <b>holds</b> that <b>an armed bandit is</b> classified as <b>a robber.</b> The paid bailee is not liable for the double payment if he claims that the deposit was taken by an armed bandit, as the double payment is paid only for a false claim of theft, not robbery. Consequently, the basis of the refutation is flawed.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>We have found</b> sources <b>for</b> the <b>liability</b> of a borrower in a case of theft or loss; <b>from where do we</b> derive a source <b>for</b> the <i>halakha</i> that in a case of theft or loss he is <b>exempt</b> if he had also borrowed the services of the owner at the same time as borrowing the animal? The verse describing his exemption from liability is stated only with regard to a case in which the animal entrusted to him is injured or dies (see Exodus 22:13).

### Part 10
<b>And if you would say: Let us derive</b> it <b>from</b> the fact that a borrower who also borrowed the services of the owner is exempt if the animal is <b>injured or dies,</b> as the type of occurrence should not make any difference, then one can counter: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about</b> a case in which it is <b>injured or dies?</b> It is notable <b>in that it is an unavoidable accident,</b> and so it is reasonable that one’s liability be limited. Can you say the same in a case of theft or loss, which theoretically he could have prevented?

### Part 11
<b>Rather, derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> that a borrower who also borrowed the services of the owner is exempt if the animal is injured or dies <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a paid bailee,</b> who is exempt for theft and loss if he had borrowed the services of the owner at the same time as the animal. The Gemara asks: <b>But from where do we</b> derive that the exemption from liability also applies to <b>a paid bailee himself? We derive the</b> limitation of <b>liability of a paid bailee from the</b> limitation of <b>liability of a borrower: Just as below,</b> with regard to a borrower, for those cases in which the verse states that he is liable, it states that if he borrowed the animal together <b>with</b> the services of the <b>owner</b> that he is <b>exempt, so too, here,</b> with regard to a paid bailee, for those cases in which he is liable, if he undertook to safeguard the animal together <b>with</b> borrowing the services of the <b>owner,</b> then he is <b>exempt.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>Through what</b> method is this <b>derived? If</b> it is derived <b>through</b> an interpretive principle known as: <b>What do we find,</b> i.e., a comparison between cases with similar details, this <b>can be refuted, just as we refuted</b> the possibility of deriving a limitation on one’s liability in a case of theft or loss from a case in which the animal was injured or died. <b>Because</b> a case in which it is injured or dies <b>is an unavoidable accident,</b> it is reasonable that one’s liability be limited specifically to such circumstances.

### Part 13
<b>Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> that a bailee who also borrowed the services of the owner is exempt if the animal is stolen or lost is derived as follows: <b>The verse states: “And if he borrows”</b> (Exodus 22:13). The conjunctive <b>“and”</b> indicates that the passage detailing the liability of a borrower <b>is adding to the first matter,</b> i.e., it should be seen as a continuation of the previous passage detailing the liability of a paid bailee. <b>And</b> therefore, <b>let the</b> case of a paid bailee <b>above be derived from</b> the case <b>below</b> of the borrower, including the exemption from liability in a case in which the services of the owner were borrowed at the same time as the animal.

### Part 14
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But still,</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a borrower cannot be derived from</b> those of <b>a paid bailee</b> though an <i>a fortiori</i> inference, <b>as</b> an attempt to do so <b>can be refuted</b> as follows: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about</b> the case of <b>a paid bailee?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> he <b>is exempt in</b> a case in which the animal is <b>injures or died. Shall you</b> also <b>say</b> the same <b>for a borrower, who is liable in</b> a case in which the animal is <b>injured or dies?</b> Since a borrower has a more severe level of liability, perhaps the exemption from liability that exists in a case of theft or loss for a paid bailee is not in effect with regard to a borrower.

### Part 15
<b>Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> that a borrower who also borrowed the services of the owner is exempt if the animal is injured or dies is derived as follows: <b>From where did we</b> originally derive <b>the liability of a borrower in</b> a case of <b>theft or loss? It was derived</b> though an <i>a fortiori</i> inference <b>from</b> the fact that <b>a paid bailee</b> is liable. One of the principles of an <i>a fortiori</i> inference is that <b>it is sufficient for the</b> conclusion that <b>emerges from</b> an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference to be like</b> its <b>source.</b> In other words, a <i>halakha</i> derived by means of an <i>a fortiori</i> inference is no more stringent than the source from which it is derived. Accordingly, <b>just as</b> in a case of <b>theft or loss of</b> a deposit entrusted with <b>a paid bailee</b> who undertook to look after it together <b>with</b> borrowing the services of its <b>owner,</b> the bailee is <b>exempt, so too,</b> in a case of <b>theft or loss of</b> a deposit entrusted with <b>a borrower</b> who had borrowed it together <b>with</b> the services of its <b>owner,</b> the borrower is <b>exempt.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who accepts</b> the principle of: <b>It is sufficient. But according to the one who does not accept</b> the principle of: <b>It is sufficient, what can be said;</b> how does he derive a borrower’s exemption from liability in a case in which he borrowed an item together with its owner’s services and the item was lost or stolen?

### Part 17
<b>Rather,</b> it is derived as follows: <b>The verse states: “And if he borrows”</b> (Exodus 22:13). The conjunctive <b>“and”</b> indicates that the passage detailing the liability of a borrower <b>is adding to the first matter,</b> i.e., the <i>halakhot</i> of a paid bailee. <b>And</b> therefore <b>let the</b> case of a paid bailee <b>above be derived from</b> the case <b>below</b> of the borrower, <b>and</b> <i>halakhot</i> applying to the case <b>below,</b> of a borrower, can be derived <b>from the</b> case <b>above,</b> of a paid bailee.

### Part 18
§ An amoraic dispute <b>was stated:</b> With regard to a mishap that occurred due to a borrower’s <b>negligence</b> in safeguarding the deposit he borrowed together <b>with</b> the services of its <b>owner, Rav Aḥa and Ravina disagree. One</b> Sage <b>says</b> he is <b>liable, and one</b> Sage <b>says</b> he is <b>exempt.</b>

### Part 19
<b>The one who says</b> he is <b>liable holds</b> that <b>the verse</b> beginning: “And if he borrows,” which details the exemption from liability when one borrows an item together with its owner, <b>is expounded</b> in connection with the passage <b>preceding it,</b> i.e., that of a paid bailee, <b>but not</b> in connection with the passage <b>preceding the one preceding it,</b> i.e., that of a unpaid bailee.

### Part 20
<b>Accordingly,</b> the verse: <b>“If its owner is with him,</b> he does not pay” (Exodus 22:14), which appears in the passage of a borrower, <b>is not written in reference to an unpaid bailee,</b> and so that exemption from liability does not apply to him. <b>And in addition,</b> the liability for <b>negligence,</b> which appears in the passage of an unpaid bailee, <b>is not written in reference to a paid bailee or a borrower. Accordingly,</b> the <b>liability of a paid bailee and of a borrower</b> in a case of negligence <b>is derived</b> only <b>via an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference from the liability of an unpaid bailee, not from an explicit verse.

### Part 21
<b>But</b> it is <b>not</b> possible to derive that <b>even a paid bailee and a borrower are exempt</b> in cases where they took hold of an item together <b>with</b> borrowing the services of its <b>owner</b> and a mishap occurred due to their negligence. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>When it is written: “If its owner is with him, he does not pay,”</b> that is <b>in reference</b> only <b>to a borrower and to a paid bailee.</b> Even then, <b>it is written in reference to</b> only <b>those liabilities that are written explicitly with regard to them.</b> It is not written with regard to their liability for negligence, which is derived only through an <i>a fortiori</i> inference. Consequently, the borrower and the paid bailee are liable for negligence even in a case where they also borrowed the services of its owner.

### Part 22
Conversely, <b>the one who says</b> that a borrower is <b>exempt holds</b> that <b>the verse:</b> “And if he borrows,” which details the exemption from liability in a case where one borrows an item together with the services of its owner, <b>is expounded</b> in connection with the passage <b>preceding it,</b> i.e., that of a paid bailee, <b>and</b> also in connection with the passage <b>preceding the one preceding it,</b> i.e., that of a unpaid bailee. <b>And</b> accordingly, <b>when it is written: “If its owner is with him,</b> he does not pay,” this exemption <b>is written also in reference to an unpaid bailee,</b> limiting his liability even in a case of negligence.

### Part 23
The Gemara suggests proofs for each opinion: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna that in the case of <b>one who borrowed a cow and he borrowed</b> the services of <b>its owner</b> together <b>with it;</b> or <b>one who borrowed a cow and he hired its owner with it;</b> or if <b>one borrowed</b> the services of <b>the owner or hired him and afterward borrowed the cow;</b> in all such cases, if the cow <b>died,</b> the borrower is <b>exempt.</b> The Gemara explains the proof: The mishna mentions the exemption from liability with regard to a borrower, <b>whereas it does not teach</b> it with regard to <b>an unpaid bailee,</b> who is liable only for a mishap that was the result of his negligence. Presumably, this is because exemption from liability does not apply to a mishap that is the result of the bailee’s negligence.

### Part 24
The Gemara rejects the proof: <b>But</b> even <b>according to your reasoning, does it teach</b> exemption from liability with regard to <b>a paid bailee?</b> It does not, although it certainly applies to at least cases of theft and loss.

### Part 25
<b>Rather,</b> with regard to the <b><i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna, <b>the matter</b>
