### Part 1
<b>which gentiles steal and castrate.</b> Since it is prohibited for Jews to castrate animals, they would sometimes arrange for a gentile to pretend to steal the animal and subsequently return it after castrating it, as it is easier to handle a castrated animal. <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a case of this kind? Shmuel’s father <b>sent to him: They used artifice;</b> therefore, you should use <b>artifice with them and make them sell it</b> as a punishment. This shows that it is prohibited to instruct a gentile to perform a prohibition on one’s behalf.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> This provides no conclusive proof, as <b>the inhabitants of the West,</b> i.e., Eretz Yisrael, who are the ones who raised this question, <b>hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥideka, who says: The descendants of Noah are commanded with regard to castration.</b> They too are prohibited from performing this practice. <b>And</b> consequently, those Jews who cause them to do it <b>transgress</b> the prohibition <b>of: “Nor put a stumbling block before the blind”</b> (Leviticus 19:14).

### Part 3
<b>Rava thought to say</b> that it is not enough that the owners may not use these animals castrated for them by gentiles, but <b>they</b> must even <b>sell</b> the animals <b>for slaughter,</b> but not for plowing, so that they would derive no benefit at all from the increase in the value of their property that resulted from a transgression. A castrated animal is worth more if it is sold for plowing, but not if it is sold for slaughter. <b>Abaye said to him:</b> It is <b>enough for them that you penalized them</b> by requiring them to <b>sell</b> the animals.

### Part 4
With regard to the same issue, the Gemara comments: It is <b>obvious</b> that if one sold the castrated animal <b>to his adult son,</b> the son <b>is considered like another</b> person, i.e., there is no need to sell to a complete stranger. If the buyer was <b>his minor son, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rav Aḥai prohibited</b> this, <b>and Rav Ashi permitted</b> it. <b>Mareimar and Mar Zutra, and some say</b> it was <b>a certain pair of</b> unknown <b>pious men, would exchange</b> such oxen <b>with each other.</b>

### Part 5
§ <b>Rami bar Ḥama raises a dilemma:</b> If one <b>placed a thorn in the mouth</b> of a threshing animal, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara is puzzled by this question: If <b>he placed</b> the thorn <b>in its</b> mouth, this <b>is</b> certainly considered <b>proper muzzling. Rather,</b> the dilemma should be formulated as follows: If <b>a thorn settled in its mouth</b> and one did not remove it, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?

### Part 6
The Gemara poses a similar question: If <b>one made a lion crouch over it from outside,</b> to frighten the animal and stop it from eating, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara responds as it did before: If <b>he made</b> the lion <b>crouch over it,</b> this <b>is</b> considered <b>proper muzzling. Rather,</b> if <b>a lion was crouching over it</b> and he did not get rid of it, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Similarly, <b>if he placed its young on the outside,</b> so that the animal looks toward its young and does not eat, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Or, if it <b>was thirsty for water, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If <b>he spread a leather blanket [<i>katavliya</i>] for it over</b> the produce it was <b>threshing,</b> so that the animal cannot see the food, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?

### Part 7
The Gemara comments: <b>Resolve at least one</b> of the abovementioned dilemmas, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The owner of a cow</b> who lent his animal to thresh the field of another <b>is permitted to starve his cow so that it will eat plenty of the</b> crop it is <b>threshing, and a homeowner is permitted to untie a bundle of straw before an animal so that it will not eat plenty of the</b> produce it is <b>threshing.</b> This is similar to spreading a blanket over the produce.

### Part 8
The Gemara refutes this comparison: No proof can be brought from here, because <b>there it is different, as it</b> at least gets to <b>eat</b> the produce. <b>If you wish, say</b> instead that the <i>baraita</i> should be explained as follows: <b>A homeowner is permitted to untie a bundle of straw before an animal at the outset,</b> before the threshing begins, <b>so that it will</b> fill itself with straw beforehand and will <b>not eat plenty of the</b> crop it is <b>threshing.</b>

### Part 9
§ <b>Rabbi Yonatan raised a dilemma before Rabbi Simai:</b> If <b>one muzzled</b> the animal <b>from the outside,</b> i.e., before it began to thresh, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara clarifies the sides of the dilemma: One can argue that <b>the Merciful One states: “An ox in its threshing”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:4), <b>and this</b> animal <b>is not in its threshing,</b> as it was muzzled before it was taken to thresh. <b>Or perhaps the Merciful One states</b> that one <b>may not</b> have the animal <b>thresh while</b> it is <b>muzzled.</b>

### Part 10
Rabbi Simai <b>said to him: You</b> can <b>learn from your father’s house,</b> i.e., you can derive this <i>halakha</i> from the case of priests, being a priest yourself. As the Torah states: <b>“Drink no wine nor strong drink, you nor your sons with you, when you come into</b> the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 10:9). Doesn’t a straightforward reading of this verse lead to the conclusion that <b>it is</b> only <b>when you come into</b> the Sanctuary <b>that it is prohibited,</b> whereas <b>to drink</b> wine <b>and</b> then <b>enter is permitted?</b>

### Part 11
This interpretation is not tenable, as with regard to the same matter <b>the Merciful One states: “That you may make a difference between the sacred and the non-sacred”</b> (Leviticus 10:10), which indicates that the priest must be capable of making these distinctions when he enters the Temple. <b>Rather, just as there,</b> with regard to the prohibition against drinking wine in the Sanctuary, the Torah means that <b>at the time of entry there must be no drunkenness,</b> whether the wine was drunk inside or outside the Sanctuary, <b>here too</b> it means that <b>at the time of threshing there must be no muzzling.</b>

### Part 12
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to <b>one who muzzles a cow</b> that someone else is using for threshing, <b>and</b> similarly, <b>one who plows with</b> animals of <b>diverse kinds together,</b> e.g., with an ox and a donkey on the same plow, he is <b>exempt, as only</b> one who <b>threshes</b> a muzzled animal <b>and</b> one <b>who leads</b> diverse kinds of animals together <b>are flogged.</b>

### Part 13
§ <b>It was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disagreed about the following case: If <b>one muzzled</b> an animal <b>with</b> his <b>voice,</b> by berating it whenever it tried to eat, <b>and</b> similarly, if <b>he led</b> diverse kinds of animals together <b>by</b> means of his <b>voice,</b> without performing any action, what is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> he is <b>liable; Reish Lakish says</b> he is <b>exempt.</b> The Gemara explains the reasoning behind their opinions: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> he is <b>liable,</b> as he maintains that <b>the twisting of one’s mouth</b> to speak <b>is</b> considered <b>an action,</b> albeit a slight one, whereas <b>Reish Lakish says</b> he is <b>exempt,</b> because a mere <b>voice is not</b> considered <b>an action.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish:</b>
