### Part 1
<b>there shall be no needy among you”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:4). This verse can be understood as a command, indicating that it is incumbent upon each individual to ensure that he will not become needy. Therefore, <b>your</b> assets <b>take precedence over</b> the assets <b>of any</b> other <b>person.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara concludes: <b>Rather,</b> the verse is necessary <b>to</b> derive the exemption from returning the lost item in the case where he was <b>an elderly person and it is not in keeping with his dignity</b> to tend to the item.

### Part 3
<b>Rabba says:</b> If there was a lost animal and the elderly person began the process of returning it, e.g., if he <b>struck it</b> even once to guide it in a certain direction, he is <b>obligated</b> to tend <b>to it</b> and return it. The Gemara relates: <b>Abaye was sitting before Rabba</b> and <b>saw these goats standing</b> nearby. <b>He picked up a clod of dirt and threw it at them,</b> causing them to move. Rabba <b>said to him: You have</b> thereby <b>obligated yourself to</b> return <b>them. Arise and return them</b> to their owner.

### Part 4
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: In a case of a person for whom it <b>is his</b> typical <b>manner to return</b> an item of that type <b>in the field,</b> where there are fewer onlookers, <b>but it is not his</b> typical <b>manner to return</b> an item of that type <b>in the city, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Do <b>we say</b> that for one to be obligated to return a lost item <b>we need an unequivocal</b> obligation to <b>return</b> it that applies in all cases, <b>and since it is not his</b> typical <b>manner to return</b> an item of that sort <b>in the city, let him not be obligated</b> to return such an item at all? <b>Or perhaps, he is obligated in any event</b> to return the item <b>in the field, and once he is obligated</b> to return <b>it in the field, he is</b> also <b>obligated in the city.</b> The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 5
<b>Rava says:</b> In <b>any</b> case <b>where he would recover his own</b> item and would consider it to be in keeping with his dignity, he is <b>also</b> obligated to <b>return another’s</b> item. <b>And any</b> case where <b>he unloads and loads his own</b> animal’s burden, he is <b>also</b> obligated to <b>unload and load</b> the burden of <b>another’s</b> animal.

### Part 6
The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, was walking on the road. A certain man encountered him,</b> and that man <b>was carrying a burden</b> that consisted of sticks <b>of wood. He set down</b> the wood <b>and was resting.</b> The man <b>said to him: Lift</b> them <b>for me</b> and place them upon me. Since it was not in keeping with the dignity of Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, to lift the wood, Rabbi Yishmael <b>said to him: How much are they worth?</b> The man <b>said to him: A half-dinar.</b> Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, <b>gave him a half-dinar,</b> took possession of the wood, <b>and declared</b> the wood <b>ownerless.</b>

### Part 7
The man <b>then reacquired</b> the wood <b>and</b> again requested that Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, lift the wood for him. Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, <b>again gave him a half-dinar,</b> again took possession of the wood, <b>and</b> again <b>declared</b> the wood <b>ownerless. He</b> then <b>saw that</b> the man <b>desired to reacquire</b> the sticks of wood. Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, <b>said to him: I declared</b> the sticks of wood <b>ownerless with regard to everyone</b> else, <b>but I did not declare them ownerless with regard to you.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>But is</b> property <b>rendered ownerless in a case like this? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Pe’a</i> 6:1) that <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> Property <b>declared ownerless for the poor is</b> thereby rendered <b>ownerless. And Beit Hillel say: It is not ownerless, until</b> the property <b>will be ownerless for the poor and for the rich, like</b> produce during <b>the Sabbatical Year,</b> which is available for all. As the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel, how could Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, declare the wood ownerless selectively, excluding the prior owner of the wood?

### Part 9
<b>Rather, Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei,</b> actually <b>declared</b> the wood <b>ownerless to everyone</b> without exception, <b>and</b> it <b>was with a mere statement that he prevented him</b> from reacquiring the wood, i.e., he told the man not to reacquire the wood even though there was no legal impediment to that reacquisition.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>But wasn’t Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, an elderly person and it was not in keeping with his dignity</b> to tend to the item? Why did he purchase the wood and render it ownerless in order to absolve himself of the obligation to lift the burden if he had no obligation to do so in the first place? The Gemara answers: In the case of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, he conducted</b> himself <b>beyond the letter of the law,</b> and he could have simply refused the request for help.

### Part 11
The Gemara cites a source for going beyond the letter of the law in the performance of mitzvot. <b>As Rav Yosef taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “And you shall teach them the statutes and the laws, and shall show them the path wherein they shall walk and the action that they must perform” (Exodus 18:20). The <i>baraita</i> parses the various directives in the verse. <b>“And you shall teach them,” that</b> is referring to <b>the structure of their livelihood,</b> i.e., teach the Jewish people trades so that they may earn a living; <b>“the path,” that</b> is referring to <b>acts of kindness; “they shall walk,” that</b> is referring to <b>visiting the ill; “wherein,” that</b> is referring to <b>burial; “and the action,” that</b> is referring to acting in accordance with the letter of the <b>law; “that they must perform,” that</b> is referring to acting <b>beyond the letter of the law.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said:</b> With regard to the phrase <b>“they shall walk,” that</b> is referring to <b>visiting the ill.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>That is</b> a detail of <b>acts of kindness;</b> why does the <i>baraita</i> list it separately? The Gemara answers: The reference to visiting the ill is <b>necessary only for the contemporary of</b> the ill person, <b>as the Master said:</b> When <b>one who is a contemporary</b> of an ill person visits him, he <b>takes one-sixtieth of his illness.</b> Since visiting an ill contemporary involves contracting a bit of his illness, a special derivation is necessary to teach that <b>even so, he is required to go</b> and visit <b>him.</b>

### Part 13
It was taught in the <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the phrase <b>“wherein,” that</b> is referring to <b>burial.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>That is</b> a detail of <b>acts of kindness;</b> why does the <i>baraita</i> list it separately? The Gemara answers: The reference to burial is <b>necessary only to</b> teach the <i>halakha</i> of <b>an elderly person, and</b> it is in a circumstance where <b>it is not in keeping with his dignity</b> to bury the dead. Therefore, a special derivation is necessary to teach that even so, he is required to participate in the burial.

### Part 14
It was taught in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>“That they must perform”; that</b> is referring to acting <b>beyond the letter of the law, as Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Jerusalem was destroyed only for</b> the fact <b>that they adjudicated</b> cases on the basis of <b>Torah law in</b> the city. The Gemara asks: <b>Rather,</b> what else should they have done? <b>Should they rather have adjudicated</b> cases on the basis of <b>arbitrary decisions [<i>demagizeta</i>]? Rather, say: That they established their rulings on</b> the basis of <b>Torah law and did not go beyond the letter of the law.</b>

### Part 15
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Which is</b> the item that is considered <b>lost property?</b> If <b>one found a donkey or a cow grazing on the path, that is not lost property,</b> as presumably the owners are nearby and are aware of the animals’ whereabouts. If one found <b>a donkey with its accoutrements overturned, or a cow</b> that <b>ran through the vineyards, that is lost property.</b> In a case where <b>one returned</b> the lost animal <b>and it fled,</b> and he again <b>returned it and it fled, even</b> if this scenario repeats itself <b>four or five times,</b> he is <b>obligated to return it</b> each time, as it <b>is stated:</b> “You shall not see your brother’s ox or his sheep wandering and disregard them; <b>you shall return them</b> to your brother” (Deuteronomy 22:1).

### Part 16
If in the course of tending to and returning the lost item, the finder <b>was idle from</b> labor that would have earned him <b>a <i>sela</i>, he shall not say to</b> the owner of the item: <b>Give me a <i>sela</i></b> to compensate me for my lost income. <b>Rather,</b> the owner <b>gives him his wage as</b> if he were <b>a laborer,</b> a payment that is considerably smaller. <b>If there are</b> three men <b>there</b> who can convene as <b>a court,</b> he <b>may stipulate before the court</b> that he will undertake to return the item provided that he receives full compensation for lost income. <b>If there is no court there before whom can he stipulate</b> his condition, <b>his</b> financial interests <b>take precedence</b> and he need not return the lost item.

### Part 17
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the question in the mishna: Which is the item that is considered lost property, the Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that all those other</b> cases <b>that we stated</b> in this chapter <b>are not lost property? Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>this</b> is what the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying: What is the principle</b> employed in defining <b>a lost item that one is obligated to</b> return? The mishna cites examples to illustrate the principle: If one <b>found a donkey or a cow grazing on the path, that is not lost property, and he is not obligated to</b> return <b>it.</b> But if one found <b>a donkey with its accoutrements overturned, or a cow that was running through the vineyards, that is lost property, and he is obligated to</b> return <b>it.</b>

### Part 18
With regard to the ruling in the mishna that a donkey and cow grazing on the path are not considered lost property, the Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is that the case even if they graze there untended <b>forever? Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: Until three days</b> pass they are not lost. Thereafter, they are considered lost. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances? If</b> the animal is found grazing <b>at night, even</b> if it is untended for <b>even one hour</b> it can be presumed to be lost, as an owner never grazes his animals untended at night. <b>If</b> the animal is found grazing <b>during the day, even</b> if it is untended for <b>more</b> than three days, it is <b>also not</b> presumed to be lost.

### Part 19
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the measure of three days <b>is necessary</b> only in a case <b>where one saw</b> the animal grazing <b>in the early</b> hours in the morning <b>and in the dark</b> of nightfall. For the first <b>three days, we say: It happened</b> that the animal <b>went out</b> a bit earlier or a bit later than usual, but nevertheless, it was with the owner’s knowledge. Once this is observed for <b>more</b> than three days, it is <b>certainly a lost item.</b>

### Part 20
<b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one found a cloak or an ax</b>
