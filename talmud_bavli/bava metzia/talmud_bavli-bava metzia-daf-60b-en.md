### Part 1
The Gemara explains: It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> by lowering the price <b>he eases the</b> market <b>rate,</b> i.e., his actions lead to the establishment of a lower market price.

### Part 2
The mishna teaches: <b>And one may not sift ground beans</b> to remove the waste and charge a higher price; this is <b>the statement of Abba Shaul. And the Rabbis permit</b> doing so. The Gemara comments: <b>Who</b> are the <b>Rabbis</b> whose opinion is cited in the mishna? It is <b>Rabbi Aḥa, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Aḥa permits</b> mixing, and sifting, and the like, in the case of <b>an item</b> in <b>which</b> the change <b>is obvious.</b>

### Part 3
The mishna taught: <b>One may neither adorn a person,</b> nor an animal, <b>nor vessels. The Sages taught: One may neither stiffen</b> the hair of <b>an animal</b> to create the impression that it is more voluminous than it is, <b>nor inflate innards</b> sold as meat to create the impression that it is a more substantial piece of meat, <b>nor soak meat in water</b> in order to change its color and create the impression that it is a choice cut. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>One may not stiffen</b> the hair of <b>an animal? Here,</b> in Babylonia, <b>they explained</b> that it means to feed the animal <b>bran water,</b> which inflates its intestines and causes its hair to stand on end. <b>Ze’eiri said</b> in the name of <b>Rav Kahana:</b> It means <b>scrubbing</b> the hair clean to increase its volume.

### Part 4
The Gemara relates: <b>Shmuel permitted</b> sellers <b>to place fringes on a cloak; Rav Yehuda permitted</b> them <b>to clean</b> and adorn <b>ornamented garments; Rabba permitted</b> them <b>to taper linen garments</b> to cause them to appear more fine; <b>Rava permitted</b> them <b>to draw arrows</b> to ornament garments; <b>Rav Pappa bar Shmuel permitted</b> them <b>to draw baskets</b> for ornamentation. The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>One may neither adorn a person, nor an animal, nor vessels?</b> The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> series of cases, where the Sages permitted adorning merchandise, are cases of <b>new</b> merchandise. It may be decorated, as doing so merely enhances its intrinsic beauty. <b>That</b> ruling in the mishna, according to which adornment is prohibited, is referring to cases <b>of old</b> merchandise, as the adornment is meant to conceal its flaws.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>Adornment of a person, what is it?</b> The Gemara relates: It is <b>as</b> in <b>that</b> incident <b>involving a certain elderly slave who went</b> and <b>dyed his head and beard</b> black to create a younger impression. <b>He came before Rava</b> and <b>said to him: Purchase me</b> as your slave. Rava <b>said to him</b> that there is a rabbinic adage: <b>Let the poor be members of your household.</b> I follow their advice and therefore do not require a slave. If I need assistance, the paupers who frequent my house can assist me.

### Part 6
The slave <b>came before Rav Pappa bar Shmuel,</b> who <b>purchased him. One day</b> Rav Pappa <b>said to</b> the slave: <b>Give me water to drink.</b> The slave <b>went and</b> removed the dye and <b>whitened</b> the hair on <b>his head and his beard.</b> The slave <b>said to</b> Rav Pappa: <b>See that I am older than your father,</b> and I am unfit to serve you. Rav Pappa <b>read about himself: The righteous person is delivered from trouble, and another comes in his stead</b> (see Proverbs 11:8). Rav Pappa applied the verse to the incident of the slave. The righteous person, Rava, was spared the problem of the slave; while another, Rav Pappa bar Shmuel, came in his stead.
