### Part 1
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states that if the borrower agrees to have the lender send the cow <b>by the hand of</b> the lender’s <b>slave,</b> and it died on the way, then the borrower is <b>liable.</b> The Gemara asks: But isn’t the <b>hand of a slave</b> legally <b>like</b> the <b>hand of his master;</b> as long as the cow is in the possession of the lender’s slave, it is not considered to have left the lender’s possession. Why, then, is the borrower liable?

### Part 2
The Gemara presents two resolutions: <b>Shmuel said:</b> The mishna is referring <b>to a Hebrew slave, whose</b> master <b>does not acquire</b> his <b>person.</b> Therefore, property in the slave’s possession is not considered to be in his master’s possession. <b>Rav said: You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the mishna is referring <b>to a Canaanite slave,</b> as this case may be <b>considered like</b> one in which the borrower <b>said to</b> the lender: <b>Hit</b> the cow <b>with a stick and</b> then <b>it will come</b> on its own to me. Just as in that case the borrower is liable once the cow leaves the lender’s domain, so too in this case he is liable once the cow leaves the lender’s domain, irrespective of the fact it was brought by the lender’s slave.

### Part 3
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one borrows a cow; and,</b> with the agreement of the borrower, the lender <b>sends it to</b> him <b>by the hand of his son</b> or <b>by the hand of his agent;</b> and it dies on the way, then the borrower is <b>liable.</b> If the lender sent it <b>by the hand of his slave,</b> then the borrower is <b>exempt.</b> The final clause appears to contradict the mishna’s ruling.

### Part 4
The Gemara elaborates: <b>Granted, according to</b> the resolution of <b>Shmuel,</b> one can explain that <b>the mishna</b> is referring <b>to a Hebrew slave,</b> whereas <b>the <i>baraita</i></b> is referring <b>to a Canaanite slave. But according to</b> the resolution of <b>Rav,</b> who maintained that the mishna is referring to a Canaanite slave, the contradiction is <b>difficult.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara presents a modified version of Rav’s resolution: <b>Rav</b> could <b>say to you: Do not say</b> in explanation of the mishna that the case may be <b>considered like</b> one in which the borrower <b>said to</b> the lender: Hit the cow with a stick and then it will come on its own. <b>Rather, say</b> that it <b>is referring to</b> a case where the borrower actually <b>said to</b> the lender: <b>Hit</b> the cow <b>with a stick and</b> then <b>it will come</b> to me on its own. Accordingly, one can explain that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case where he did not say this, and therefore, as long as the cow is still in the procession of the slave, the borrower is not liable.

### Part 6
<b>As</b> it <b>was stated:</b> One said to another: <b>Lend me your cow. And</b> the lender <b>said to</b> the borrower: <b>By whose hand</b> shall I send it? <b>And</b> the borrower <b>said to him: Hit</b> the cow <b>with a stick and</b> then <b>it will come</b> on its own to me. <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> In this case, the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>once</b> the cow <b>left the domain of the lender and</b> then <b>it died,</b> the borrower is <b>liable.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that the following <i>baraita</i> <b>supports</b> this opinion of Rav: One said to another: <b>Lend me your cow. And</b> the lender <b>said to</b> the borrower: <b>By whose hand</b> shall I send it? <b>And</b> the borrower <b>said to him: Hit</b> the cow <b>with a stick and</b> then <b>it will come</b> on its own to me. The <i>halakha</i> is that <b>once</b> the cow <b>left the domain of the lender and</b> then <b>it died,</b> the borrower is <b>liable.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rav Ashi said</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is not a conclusive proof of Rav’s opinion. It is possible to say: <b>With what are we dealing here;</b> with a case <b>where</b> the <b>courtyard of</b> the <b>borrower</b> is situated <b>further in</b> from the public domain <b>than</b> the <b>courtyard of</b> the <b>lender,</b> such <b>that when</b> the lender <b>sends</b> the cow to him, <b>it will certainly go to there.</b> Consequently, the borrower is willing to accept liability from the moment the lender sends it.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> if that is the case addressed in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>what</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> this <i>halakha</i>? It is obvious. The Gemara explains: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for the case of a courtyard in <b>which there are corners. Lest you say:</b> The borrower <b>does not rely</b> on the possibility that the animal will come to him, as <b>perhaps</b> the animal will go and <b>stand there</b> in one of the corners <b>and not come straight</b> to the borrower’s courtyard, the <i>baraita</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that even in such a case <b>he relies</b> on the assumption that the cow will nevertheless come to him, and so he accepts liability.

### Part 10
§ <b>Rav Huna says:</b> In the case of <b>one who borrows an ax from another,</b> once <b>he has chopped</b> wood <b>with it, he has acquired it,</b> but as long as <b>he has not chopped</b> wood <b>with it, he has not acquired it.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara clarifies: With regard <b>to what</b> matter does one acquire the ax? <b>If we say</b> he has acquired it <b>for</b> the purpose of being liable for <b>unavoidable mishaps,</b> i.e., his liability as a borrower begins once he uses the ax, then one could ask: <b>What is different</b> when one borrows <b>a cow, that</b> one is liable as a borrower <b>from the moment of borrowing,</b> even before one makes use of it? <b>Rather,</b> Rav Huna refers <b>to</b> one’s right of <b>retraction,</b> as follows: Once the borrower <b>has chopped</b> wood <b>with it,</b> the <b>lender cannot renege on</b> his commitment to lend the item, but as long as the borrower <b>has not chopped</b> wood <b>with it,</b> the <b>lender can renege on</b> his commitment to lend the item and prevent the borrower from borrowing the item.

### Part 12
<b>And</b> with this opinion, Rav Huna <b>disagrees with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ami, as Rabbi Ami says: One who lends</b> another <b>an ax</b> that is <b>of</b> property <b>consecrated</b> to the Temple treasury <b>has</b> there-by <b>misused</b> consecrated property. He is liable to pay the Temple treasury <b>according to the financial advantage</b> he received from lending the ax. <b>And</b> despite this, that <b>other</b> person, i.e., the borrower, is <b>permitted to chop</b> wood <b>with it <i>ab initio</i>.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara explains how it is apparent that Rabbi Ami disagrees with Rav Huna: <b>And if</b> one holds that the borrower <b>does not acquire</b> the ax from the moment of borrowing, <b>why has</b> the lender <b>misused</b> consecrated property? To be liable for misuse of consecrated property, one must acquire the item, thereby removing it from the Temple treasury. <b>And</b> furthermore, <b>why is</b> that <b>other</b> person <b>permitted to chop</b> wood <b>with it <i>ab initio</i>?</b> If the borrower does not acquire the ax from the moment of borrowing, <b>let</b> the borrower <b>return</b> the ax <b>and not acquire it, and</b> consequently the lender <b>will not have misused</b> consecrated property, as it will have turned out that nothing significant occurred. Rather, it is evident that Rabbi Ami holds that the act of lending is fully completed as soon as the borrower takes the ax, even before he has used it.

### Part 14
<b>And</b> furthermore, with this opinion, Rav Huna <b>disagrees with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Elazar, as Rabbi Elazar says:</b> In the <b>same way in which</b> the Sages <b>instituted for buyers</b> that they can acquire an item by <b>pulling</b> it, and from that point the transaction is completed, <b>so</b> too <b>they instituted for bailees</b> that their rights and responsibilities are initiated by their <b>pulling</b> the item they agreed to safeguard, and from that point the transfer of the item to the bailee is completed.

### Part 15
<b>This</b> opinion of Rabbi Elazar <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Just as</b> the Sages <b>instituted for buyers</b> that they can acquire an item by <b>pulling</b> it, <b>so</b> too <b>they instituted for bailees</b> that that their rights and responsibilities are initiated by them <b>pulling</b> the item they agreed to safeguard. <b>And just as</b>
