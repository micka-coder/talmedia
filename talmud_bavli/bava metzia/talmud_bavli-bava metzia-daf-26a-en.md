<b>where</b> the item is <b>extremely rusted,</b> indicating that it had been left there for a long time.

### Part 2
§ The mishna teaches: If <b>one found</b> lost items <b>in a new wall from its midpoint and outward,</b> they belong <b>to him.</b> But if he found the items <b>from its midpoint and inward,</b> they belong <b>to the homeowner.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The determination of ownership with regard to <b>a knife</b> found in a wall <b>follows the handle, and</b> the determination of ownership with regard to a money <b>pouch follows the laces</b> at the opening of the pouch. If the handle or laces face inward, they belong to the homeowner. If the handle or laces face outward, they belong to the finder.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, what is the applicability of the ruling of <b>the mishna, which teaches:</b> If one found lost items in a new wall <b>from its midpoint and outward,</b> they belong <b>to him,</b> and <b>from its midpoint and inward,</b> they belong <b>to the homeowner? But</b> instead, to determine ownership, <b>let us see if its handle</b> faces <b>inward</b> or <b>if its handle</b> faces <b>outward,</b> or <b>if its straps</b> face <b>inward or if its straps</b> face <b>outward.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The mishna</b> is referring to a case <b>where</b> one found <b>rags or metal strips.</b>

### Part 5
It is <b>taught: If</b> the hollow in the <b>wall was filled with</b> lost items, e.g., coins, the homeowner and the finder <b>divide</b> them. The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach this only in a case <b>where the</b> hollow in the <b>wall is inclined toward one side</b> of the wall. <b>Lest you say</b> that all the items were initially on the elevated side, and due to the incline they <b>slipped</b> and filled the entire space, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that the homeowner and the finder divide them.

### Part 6
§ The mishna teaches: <b>If</b> the homeowner <b>would rent</b> the house <b>to others</b> on a regular basis and there was a steady turnover of residents, <b>even</b> if one found lost items <b>inside the house, these</b> belong <b>to him.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And why</b> do they belong to the finder? <b>Let us follow the last</b> renter and determine that he is the owner of the items.

### Part 7
<b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 7:2): With regard to <b>money that was found before animal merchants</b> in Jerusalem, it is <b>always</b> assumed to be money of the second <b>tithe,</b> as most of the animals purchased in Jerusalem were bought with second-tithe money. This <i>halakha</i> applies both during a Festival and throughout the year, as people would typically purchase animals for meat with their second-tithe money. If the money was found <b>on the Temple Mount</b> it is considered <b>non-sacred</b> money. This <i>halakha</i> applies even during a Festival, when people would come to Jerusalem with second-tithe money in hand, as it can be assumed that one who entered the Temple Mount had already spent that money and only non-sacred money is left in his possession.

### Part 8
The mishna continues: <b>And</b> if the coins were found elsewhere <b>in Jerusalem,</b> the following distinction applies: If it was found <b>during the rest of the days of the year,</b> it is considered <b>non-sacred</b> money. But if the money was found <b>during the Festival,</b> when many people would come to Jerusalem with their second-tithe money, <b>all</b> money is presumed to be second-<b>tithe</b> money.

### Part 9
<b>And Rav Shemaya bar Ze’eira says</b> in explanation of the mishna: <b>What is the reason</b> that during the rest of the year the money is considered non-sacred, even on the day after the Festival? <b>Since the markets of Jerusalem tend to be cleaned every day,</b> any money left there would already have been found by the street cleaners. Consequently, any money found there must have been left there recently. <b>Apparently, we say</b> that <b>each of the first</b> coins <b>is gone, and these</b> coins <b>are other</b> ones, i.e., they were left there after the conclusion of the Festival. <b>Here too,</b> with regard to lost items found in a rented house, why not say that the items belonging <b>to each of the first</b> renters <b>are gone and these</b> items belong <b>to the last</b> renter?

### Part 10
<b>Reish Lakish said in the name of bar Kappara:</b> The mishna that states that the item belongs to the finder is referring to a case <b>where</b> the homeowner <b>rendered</b> his house <b>an inn [<i>pundak</i>] for three Jews.</b> Since it is unclear to which of them the item belonged, the owner despairs of its recovery.

### Part 11
The Gemara previously (see 24a) raised a dilemma with regard to the <i>halakha</i> stated by Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar that a lost item found in a location frequented by the multitudes belongs to the finder. Is the <i>halakha</i> in accordance with his ruling? Moreover, is his ruling specifically with regard to a location with a gentile majority, or is it even applicable in a location with a Jewish majority? Based on the opinion of bar Kappara, the Gemara suggests: <b>Conclude from it that</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar even in</b> a location with <b>a Jewish majority.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara rejects this conclusion, and presents an alternative explanation of the latter clause of the mishna. <b>Rather, Rav Menashya bar Ya’akov said:</b> The mishna is referring to a case <b>where he rendered</b> his house <b>an inn for three gentiles.</b> According to that explanation, perhaps Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar issued his ruling specifically in a location with a gentile majority.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Naḥman</b> said that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said: Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that the owner <b>rendered</b> his house <b>an inn for three Jews,</b> one cannot conclude that Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar issued his ruling even in an area with a Jewish majority. <b>What is the reason</b> that the item belongs to the finder? It is because <b>the</b> person <b>from whom</b> the item <b>fell despairs</b> of its recovery. The one who lost the item <b>says: Now, no other person was with me</b> here, <b>only these</b> residents of the inn. <b>I said in their presence several times to return</b> the item <b>to me, and they did not return</b> it <b>to me; and</b> is it likely that <b>now</b> they are going <b>to return</b> it? <b>If their intention was to return</b> the item, <b>they would have</b> already <b>returned it to me, and</b> the fact <b>that they did not</b> yet <b>return it to me</b> indicates that it is <b>their intention to rob</b> me of the item.

### Part 14
<b>And Rav Naḥman follows his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as Rav Naḥman says:</b> If one <b>saw a <i>sela</i></b> coin
