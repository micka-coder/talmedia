### Part 1
<b>why</b> does one <b>go back and take the collateral</b> again, as the creditor must anyway restore it to the debtor the following day? The Gemara replies: Any loan that is secured by collateral is not canceled by the Sabbatical Year, in contrast to other debts, which are canceled. Therefore, this ensures <b>that the Sabbatical</b> Year <b>should not cancel it. And</b> an additional reason is so that the collateral <b>should not become movable property</b> in the possession <b>of his children,</b> as one generally cannot claim such items from orphans to pay for their father’s debt.

### Part 2
The Gemara infers: The <b>reason</b> these exceptions apply is <b>that</b> he <b>goes back and takes it as collateral; but</b> if he did <b>not go back and take it as collateral,</b> these exceptions do <b>not</b> apply. This <i>baraita</i> therefore contradicts the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, who held that the initial seizing of collateral is sufficient to grant the creditor full rights to it.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Adda bar Mattana said: And did you not resolve</b> this <i>baraita</i> once already by adjusting its wording slightly? <b>Answer</b> it by changing its formulation again in <b>this</b> manner: <b>And since</b> one must <b>return</b> the collateral, <b>why</b> does one <b>take collateral at the outset?</b> It is done so <b>that the Sabbatical</b> Year <b>should not cancel</b> the debt, <b>and</b> so that it <b>should not become movable property</b> in the possession <b>of his children.</b> This version is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, as it teaches that one who has taken collateral even on a single occasion may confiscate it from the debtor’s heirs.

### Part 4
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states: “When you lend your neighbor any manner of loan, <b>you shall not go into his house to take his collateral”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:10). This verse indicates that <b>you may not enter his house, but you</b> may <b>enter the house of a guarantor</b> to take collateral from him. <b>And similarly it states: “Take his garment that is a surety for a stranger”</b> (Proverbs 20:16).

### Part 5
<b>And it</b> further <b>states</b> with regard to the same issue: <b>“My son, if you are a guarantor for your neighbor, if you have struck your hands for a stranger, you are ensnared by the words of your mouth; you are caught by the words of your mouth. Do this, now, my son, and deliver yourself, when you have come into the hand of your friend; go humble yourself and strengthen your friend”</b> (Proverbs 6:1–3).

### Part 6
This passage in Proverbs is interpreted as follows: The phrase “You are snared by the words of your mouth” is referring to a guarantor who obligated himself to pay or one who upset his friend with his comments. In such a case, one should do the following: <b>If he has money in your hand,</b> “go humble yourself [<i>hitrapes</i>],” which is expounded as: <b>Release for him the palm of your hand [<i>hatter lo pissat yad</i>]</b> to give him his money. <b>And if</b> it is <b>not</b> money that you owe him, but rather you have “become ensnared by the words of your mouth” and owe him an apology for a personal slight, <b>gather together many neighbors</b> through which to seek <b>his</b> forgiveness.

### Part 7
The verse “When you lend your neighbor any manner of loan, you shall not go into his house to take his collateral” can be interpreted <b>in a different direction,</b> i.e., in another manner: <b>You may not enter his house</b> to take collateral for the loan, <b>but</b> if he owes wages, <b>you may enter</b> and take collateral <b>for a porter’s wages, for a donkey driver’s wages, for an innkeeper’s payment,</b> or <b>for the wages for</b> one who made <b>drawings [<i>diyokanaot</i>]</b> for him. One <b>might</b> have thought that this applies <b>even</b> if the one owed the money <b>establishes it as a loan for</b> the one who owes the money after he was already liable for such payment. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Any manner</b> of loan” (Deuteronomy 24:10), which demonstrates that once the debt has been converted into a loan, it is like any other loan, and therefore one may not take collateral against the debtor’s will.

### Part 8
mishna With regard to <b>a widow, whether she is poor</b> or <b>whether she is wealthy,</b> one <b>may not take collateral from her, as it is stated: “And you may not take the garment of a widow as collateral”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:17).

### Part 9
gemara <b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to <b>a widow, whether she is poor</b> or <b>whether she is wealthy,</b> one <b>may not take collateral from her.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> With regard to <b>a wealthy</b> widow, one may <b>take collateral from her.</b> But with regard to <b>a poor</b> widow, one may <b>not take collateral from her,</b> because <b>you</b> are <b>obligated to return</b> it <b>to her,</b> in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> that the collateral of a poor person must be returned to him whenever he needs it. <b>And</b> since you will be entering every day to return the collateral to her, <b>you</b> will thereby <b>give her a bad name among her neighbors,</b> as they will suspect her of developing an inappropriate relationship with you. By contrast, in the case of a wealthy widow, since there is no obligation to return her collateral, it is permitted to take collateral from her.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: Is this <b>to say that Rabbi Yehuda does not interpret the rationale</b> behind the mitzva <b>in the verse</b> and draw halakhic conclusions based on that interpretation, and <b>Rabbi Shimon does interpret the rationale</b> behind the mitzva <b>in the verse? But</b> haven’t we <b>heard them</b> holding <b>the reverse</b> opinions elsewhere?

### Part 12
<b>As it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 21a) concerning the mitzvot of a king: <b>“And he should not multiply wives for himself,</b> that his heart not turn away” (Deuteronomy 17:17). <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: He</b> may <b>accumulate many</b> wives <b>for himself, provided that they are not</b> like those who <b>turn his heart</b> from reverence for God. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Even one who turns his heart away, he should not marry her. If so, why is it stated: “He shall not multiply wives for himself”?</b> This teaches that <b>even</b> with regard to wives <b>like Abigail,</b> who was righteous and prevented David from sin (see I Samuel chapter 25), he is forbidden to have many. In this case, Rabbi Shimon does not interpret the rationale of the verse, while Rabbi Yehuda does interpret its rationale.

### Part 13
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually, Rabbi Yehuda does not</b> generally <b>interpret the rationale of the verse, and</b> it <b>is different here,</b> with regard to a king, <b>as the verse</b> itself <b>specifies</b> the reason: <b>“And he should not multiply wives for himself, that</b> his heart <b>not turn away.” What is the reason</b> that <b>he may not multiply wives for himself?</b> It is <b>because</b> he must ensure <b>that</b> his heart <b>will not turn away.</b>

### Part 14
<b>And Rabbi Shimon</b> maintains: <b>Since we generally interpret the rationale in the verse,</b> there is no need for the verse itself to supply the rationale for the prohibition. <b>Let the Merciful One state: “He may not multiply,” and we do not need</b> the Torah to add “that his heart <b>not turn away,” and I</b> would already <b>know</b> the answer to the question: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>he may not accumulate</b> many wives? It is <b>because</b> of the concern that his heart <b>not turn away.</b> If so, <b>why do I</b> need the phrase “His heart <b>not turn away” that the Merciful One writes?</b> It must certainly be necessary in order to increase the scope of the prohibition: <b>Even</b> if there is <b>one</b> woman who <b>turns his heart away, he may not marry her.</b> Therefore, the verse includes two <i>halakhot</i>: A general stricture against a king’s marrying too many women, and a further <i>halakha</i> that a king may not marry even one woman who will lead him astray.

### Part 15
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> One <b>who takes a millstone as collateral violates a prohibition, and</b> he is <b>liable for</b> taking <b>two vessels,</b> i.e., both millstones in the pair, <b>as it is stated: “He shall not take the lower or upper millstone as collateral”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:6). The <i>tanna</i> adds: <b>Not only</b> did the Sages <b>say</b> that it is prohibited to take <b>the lower or upper millstone</b> as collateral, <b>but</b> they also said that one may not take <b>anything that</b> people <b>use in the preparation of food [<i>okhel nefesh</i>], as it is stated: “For he takes a man’s life [<i>nefesh</i>] as collateral”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:6).

### Part 16
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Huna says:</b> One who <b>took a lower millstone as collateral is flogged</b> with <b>two</b> sets of lashes: One set is <b>due to</b> violating the prohibition of taking the <b>lower millstone</b> as collateral, <b>and</b> the second is <b>due to: “For he takes a man’s life as collateral,”</b> since he took an item used in the preparation of food. If he took <b>the lower and upper millstone,</b> he <b>is flogged</b> with <b>three</b> sets of lashes: Two sets are <b>due to</b> violating the prohibitions of taking <b>a lower millstone and an upper millstone</b> as collateral, <b>and</b> the third is <b>due to</b> violating the prohibition: <b>“For he takes a man’s life as collateral.”</b>

### Part 17
<b>And Rav Yehuda says:</b> If he <b>took a lower millstone as collateral he is flogged</b> with <b>one</b> set of lashes, if he took <b>an upper millstone he is flogged</b> with <b>one</b> set of lashes, and if he took both <b>the lower and upper millstones</b> together as collateral <b>he is flogged</b> with <b>two</b> sets of lashes. With regard to the verse: <b>“For he takes a man’s life as collateral,”</b>
