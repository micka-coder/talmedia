### Part 1
<b>he has said nothing.</b> His claim is not accepted. <b>What is the reason</b> that he is not believed? It is because one who is owed <b>any</b> money based on <b>a court enactment is</b> considered <b>like one who is holding</b> a promissory <b>note in his hand,</b> against which a claim of repayment is not accepted without supporting evidence.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said to Rabbi Yoḥanan: But</b> what are you adding? <b>Isn’t this</b> principle stated in <b>a mishna</b> (<i>Ketubot</i> 88b), which teaches: If a woman <b>produced a bill of divorce, and there was no accompanying marriage contract, she collects</b> payment of <b>her marriage contract?</b> This is an example of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s principle that a court enactment enables one to collect a debt even without the relevant document.

### Part 3
Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him:</b> True, this mishna is a source for my principle; but <b>had I not lifted up the shard for you, you would not have found a pearl beneath it.</b> In other words, if Rabbi Yoḥanan had not pointed out the principle, Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba would not have realized that it was underlying the ruling of the mishna.

### Part 4
<b>Abaye said: What</b> qualifies this proof as <b>a pearl?</b> It is not a compelling proof, as <b>perhaps</b> in the mishna <b>we are dealing with a place where they do not write a marriage contract, as</b> in such a place, a woman’s <b>bill of divorce is</b> the same as <b>her marriage contract. But in a place where they do write a marriage contract, if she is holding a marriage contract</b> then <b>she collects</b> payment, and <b>if not, she does not collect</b> payment. There is no proof from the mishna in support of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s principle.

### Part 5
<b>Abaye then said: What I said is not correct. As, if it enters your mind</b> that <b>we are dealing with a place where they do not write a marriage contract, but in a place where they do write a marriage contract, if she is holding a marriage contract</b> then <b>she collects</b> payment, and <b>if not she does not collect</b> payment, then <b>through what</b> means <b>does a widow from</b> her <b>betrothal collect</b> payment of her marriage contract? She has neither a marriage contract nor a bill of divorce.

### Part 6
If it is suggested that she can collect payment <b>by</b> means of <b>witnesses to the death of</b> her <b>husband, let</b> the husband’s heir, from whom she is demanding payment, <b>claim and say: I paid it;</b> she has no proof that she did not receive the money. <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>indeed,</b> the heir can claim that he has paid what he owes, <b>if so, what did the Sages accomplish with their ordinance</b> that a widow from betrothal receives payment of her marriage contract? The heirs can always exempt themselves.

### Part 7
<b>Mar Kashisha, son of Rav Ḥisda, said to Rav Ashi,</b> questioning the underlying assumption of Abaye: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that a widow from</b> her <b>betrothal has</b> the right to receive payment of her <b>marriage contract?</b>

### Part 8
<b>If we say</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is derived <b>from that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ketubot</i> 54b): If a woman <b>became widowed or divorced, whether from betrothal or from marriage, she collects all</b> that she is entitled to, both the main sum of her marriage contract instituted by the Sages and the additional sum that her husband added; that mishna cannot serve as a source for the <i>halakha</i> that a widow from her betrothal has the right to receive payment of her marriage contract. As <b>perhaps</b> the mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> the husband <b>wrote</b> a marriage contract <b>for her,</b> but if he did not, she does not receive any money at all.

### Part 9
<b>And if you would say:</b> In that case, <b>what</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> this <i>halakha</i> since it is obvious that she can collect payment if she has a written contract, then one could respond that it is stated <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, who says</b> that a widow from betrothal does not receive that which the husband committed to pay in the marriage contract, <b>as he wrote</b> the marriage contract <b>only on the condition</b> that he would <b>marry her.</b> He did not intend to obligate himself in a situation where he died before their marriage. Therefore, it <b>was necessary for</b> the mishna to mention that a widow from betrothal who has a written marriage contract collects payment.

### Part 10
The language of the mishna <b>is also precise</b> according to this understanding, <b>as it teaches: She collects all</b> that she is entitled to. <b>Granted, if you say that</b> the mishna is referring to a case where the husband <b>wrote her</b> a marriage contract, <b>this is</b> why the mishna <b>teaches</b> that <b>she collects all</b> that she is entitled to, i.e., even the amount that the husband added to the main sum of the marriage contract. <b>But if you say that</b> it is referring a case where <b>he did not write her</b> a marriage contract,
