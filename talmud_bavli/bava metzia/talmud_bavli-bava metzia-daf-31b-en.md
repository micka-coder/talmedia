### Part 1
<b>but</b> in the case of <b>these two</b> mitzvot of unloading and loading, <b>where its owner is with it,</b> I might <b>say no,</b> there is no need to assist him. Therefore, it was <b>necessary</b> for the Torah to write both.

### Part 2
§ The Gemara cited additional derivations from compound verb forms. “Or in enmity struck him with his hand, that he died; <b>he that struck him shall be put to death [<i>mot yumat</i>]”</b> (Numbers 35:21). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the murderer is executed <b>with</b> the form of <b>death written with regard to him,</b> i.e., decapitation. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that if you are unable to execute him with</b> the form of <b>death written with regard to him, it is permitted for you to execute him with any death</b> with <b>which you are able to execute him? The verse states: “<i>Mot yumat</i>,”</b> to teach that you must execute him <b>in any case.</b>

### Part 3
With regard to an idolatrous city, it is written: <b>“You shall strike [<i>hakeh takeh</i>]</b> the inhabitants of that city by sword, destroying it utterly” (Deuteronomy 13:16). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the residents of the idolatrous city are executed <b>with</b> the form of <b>death written with regard to them,</b> i.e., decapitation. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that if you are unable to execute them with</b> the form of <b>death written with regard to them, it is permitted for you to execute them with any death</b> with <b>which you are able to execute them? The verse states: “<i>Hakeh takeh</i>,”</b> to teach that you must execute him <b>in any case.</b>

### Part 4
With regard to an item that a poor person needs, e.g., a blanket, that a lender took as collateral when lending him money, it is written: <b>“You shall restore [<i>hashev tashiv</i>]</b> to him the pledge when the sun goes down, that he may sleep in his garment, and bless you; and it shall be righteousness for you before the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 24:13). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> the obligation to return his garment each night in a case where the lender <b>took collateral with the sanction of the court. From where</b> do I derive the obligation to return his garment each night even in a case where the lender <b>took collateral without the sanction of the court? The verse states: “<i>Hashev tashiv</i>,”</b> to teach that he must return it <b>in any case.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara brings another derivation from a compound verb written with regard to returning collateral: “If you <b>take as collateral [<i>ḥavol taḥbol</i>]</b> your neighbor’s garment, you shall restore it to him until the sun sets” (Exodus 22:25). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> the obligation to return his garment before sunset in a case where the lender <b>took collateral with the sanction of the court. From where</b> do I derive the obligation to return his garment each night even in a case where the lender <b>took collateral without the sanction of the court? The verse states: “<i>Ḥavol taḥbol</i>,”</b> to teach that he must return it <b>in any case.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>these two verses, why do I</b> need both of them to teach the same <i>halakha</i>, that one must return to the debtor any garment that he needs? The Gemara answers: <b>One</b> is referring <b>to a garment</b> worn during the <b>day, and one</b> is referring <b>to a garment</b> worn during the <b>night</b> (see 114b).

### Part 7
With regard to the mitzva of giving charity and granting loans, it is written: “For the poor shall never cease out of the land; therefore I command you, saying: <b>You shall open [<i>patoaḥ tiftaḥ</i>]</b> your hand to your poor and needy brother in your land” (Deuteronomy 15:11). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> the obligation to give charity <b>to the poor</b> residents <b>of your city. From where</b> is the obligation to give charity <b>to the poor</b> residents <b>of another city</b> derived? <b>The verse states: “<i>Patoaḥ tiftaḥ</i>,”</b> to teach that you must give charity to the poor <b>in any case.</b>

### Part 8
With regard to the mitzva of giving charity it is written: “Beware…and your eye is stingy against your needy brother…<b>You shall give [<i>naton titten</i>]</b> him, and your heart shall not be grieved when you give unto him” (Deuteronomy 15:9–10). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> the obligation to give <b>a large gift. From where</b> is the obligation to give even <b>a small gift</b> derived? <b>The verse states: “<i>Naton titten</i>,”</b> to teach that one must give gifts <b>in any case,</b> whether a large gift or a small one.

### Part 9
With regard to the release of a Hebrew slave it is written: <b>“You shall furnish [<i>ha’aneik ta’anik</i>]</b> him liberally from your flock, and from your threshing floor, and from your winepress; of that which the Lord your God has blessed you, you shall give unto him” (Deuteronomy 15:14). Based on the conclusion of the verse, <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>when the house is blessed because of him, one furnishes</b> the slave with gifts. <b>From where</b> have I derived the obligation to furnish him with gifts even when <b>the house is not blessed because of him? The verse states: “<i>Ha’aneik ta’anik</i>,”</b> to teach that one must furnish him with gifts <b>in any case.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, who says:</b> If <b>the house is blessed because of him, one furnishes him</b> with gifts, and if <b>the house is not blessed because of him,</b> one need <b>not furnish</b> him with gifts, <b>why do I</b> need a compound verb, “<i>ha’aneik <b>ta’anik</b></i><b>”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The Torah speaks in the language of people.</b> The compound verb is a common conversational style, and the Torah employs the same style. Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya holds there is nothing extraordinary about it and therefore, nothing may be derived from it.

### Part 11
With regard to the mitzva of lending money to the poor it is written: “But you shall open your hand to him, and <b>you shall lend [<i>ha’avet ta’avitennu</i>]</b> him sufficient for his need that he is lacking” (Deuteronomy 15:8). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that in a case <b>where one does not have</b> resources <b>and does not want to be supported</b> with charity, <b>the Merciful One states: Provide</b> for <b>him by means of a loan.</b> In a case where <b>he has</b> resources <b>and he does not want to support himself</b> with his resources, <b>from where</b> is the obligation to lend him money derived? <b>The verse states: “<i>Ta’avitennu</i>,”</b> to teach that you must grant him a loan <b>in any case.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Rabbi Shimon, who says</b> that in a case where <b>he has</b> resources <b>and does not want to support himself</b> with his resources <b>one is not obligated to attend to his</b> needs, <b>why do I</b> need a doubled verb: “<i>Ha’avet <b>ta’avitennu</b></i><b>”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The Torah speaks in the language of people</b> and nothing may be derived from it.

### Part 13
§ The mishna teaches: If in the course of tending to and returning the lost item, the finder <b>was idle from</b> labor that would have earned him <b>a <i>sela</i>, he shall not say to</b> the owner of the item: <b>Give me a <i>sela</i></b> to compensate me for my lost income. <b>Rather,</b> the owner <b>gives him his wage as</b> if he were <b>a laborer.</b> The Gemara cites that <b>we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 4:11): The owner <b>gives him his wage as</b> if he were <b>an idle laborer.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>As</b> if he were <b>an idle laborer?</b> In fact, he is not idle, but engaged in return of a lost item. <b>Abaye said:</b> It means that he is paid <b>as a laborer</b> who is <b>idle from that</b> typical <b>labor</b> of his <b>from which he is</b> kept <b>idle.</b> In other words, he must receive the amount of money a person would be willing to accept to refrain from his current occupation and engage in returning a lost item. This calculation accounts for both the degree of difficulty of his steady employment and the amount of his remuneration.

### Part 15
§ The mishna teaches: <b>If there are</b> three men <b>there</b> who can convene as <b>a court,</b> he <b>may stipulate before</b> the court that he will undertake to return the item provided that he receives full compensation for lost income. The Gemara relates: <b>Issur and Rav Safra formed a joint venture with each other. Rav Safra went and dissolved</b> their partnership <b>without Issur’s knowledge in the presence of two</b> witnesses. Rav Safra <b>came before Rabba bar Rav Huna</b> in order to ratify the dissolution of the partnership. Rabba bar Rav Huna <b>said to him: Go</b> and <b>bring me</b> the court of <b>three before whom you dissolved</b> your partnership. <b>Alternatively,</b> you may bring
