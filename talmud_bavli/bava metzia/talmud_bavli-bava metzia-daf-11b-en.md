### Part 1
<b>and the place of</b> the tithe <b>is rented to him.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua paid him a token sum to rent the field, which presumably became the equivalent of his courtyard, and thereby acquired the tithe. <b>And another one-tenth that I will measure out in the future</b> and separate from my produce as the poor man’s tithe <b>is given to Akiva ben Yosef so that he will acquire it for the poor, and its place is rented to him.</b>

### Part 2
Rabbi Abba continued: <b>But were Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Akiva standing next to Rabban Gamliel’s field</b> then? All of them were on the ship. Apparently, one’s courtyard effects acquisition for him even when he is not standing next to it.

### Part 3
Ulla <b>said to him: This one of the Sages seems like one who has not studied <i>halakha</i>.</b> Ulla dismissed the question entirely, as he deemed it unworthy of consideration.

### Part 4
<b>When</b> Rabbi Abba <b>came to Sura,</b> he related the discussion to the local scholars, <b>saying to them: This is what Ulla said, and this is how I challenged him. One of the Sages said to him: Rabban Gamliel transferred ownership of</b> the <b>movable property,</b> the tithes, <b>to</b> them <b>by means of</b> renting them the <b>land.</b> The transaction concerning the tithes was effected not by causing the location of the produce to become the equivalent of a courtyard belonging to Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Akiva, but rather by employing the principle that movable property can be acquired together with the acquisition of land. The Gemara comments: <b>Rabbi Zeira accepted</b> this response to Rabbi Abba’s objection, but <b>Rabbi Abba did not accept it.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rava said:</b> Rabbi Abba <b>did well by not accepting</b> this response, because if Rabban Gamliel had intended to transfer his ownership of the tithes to Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Akiva, <b>did they not have a cloth</b> with which <b>to acquire</b> the tithes <b>from him by means of</b> a symbolic <b>exchange?</b> They could have acquired the tithes through symbolic exchange without renting the land. <b>Rather,</b> clearly the tithes were not considered the property of Rabban Gamliel, as he owned only <b>the benefit of discretion,</b> i.e., the benefit accrued from the option of giving the tithes to whichever Levite or poor person that he chose, and such benefit <b>is not</b> considered <b>property that can be acquired by means of</b> a symbolic <b>exchange. Here, too,</b> the transaction was clearly effected by means of a courtyard, as <b>benefit of discretion is not property that can be acquired by means of</b> acquiring <b>land.</b> Therefore, Rabbi Abba’s explanation must be correct, and one’s courtyard effects acquisition for him even when he is not standing next to it.

### Part 6
The Gemara rejects Rava’s reasoning: <b>But</b> that <b>is not so. With regard to gifts</b> to which members <b>of the priesthood</b> are entitled, and similarly with regard to tithes that are given to Levites and to the poor, the concept of <b>giving is written</b> in the Torah: “And have given it to the Levite, to the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow” (Deuteronomy 26:12). These gifts must be given and not sold or bartered. Therefore, since <b>exchange is a form of buying and selling,</b> it is an inappropriate mode of acquisition with regard to tithes. By contrast, transferring ownership of <b>movable property by means of</b> transferring ownership of <b>land is a powerful</b> form of <b>giving.</b> Consequently, Rabban Gamliel could not give them the tithes by means of a symbolic exchange using a cloth, but instead had to give it to them along with land. Therefore, since the transaction was not effected by means of a courtyard, it poses no difficulty to Ulla’s opinion.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> Even if Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Akiva acquired the tithes by means of a courtyard, this poses no difficulty to Ulla’s opinion. Since the tithes were not ownerless items, but rather <b>another mind,</b> i.e., Rabban Gamliel, <b>transferred their ownership</b> to Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Akiva, it <b>is different,</b> and the recipients did not need to stand next to the courtyard.

### Part 8
<b>And from where do you state</b> this distinction? <b>As we learned</b> in the mishna: If one <b>saw</b> people <b>running after a found</b> ownerless animal, and said: My field has effected acquisition of this animal for me, it has effected acquisition of it for him. <b>And Rabbi Yirmeya says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that this <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> true only in a case <b>where he</b> would be able to <b>run after them and catch them. And Rabbi Yirmeya raises a dilemma: Does</b> one acquire animals that are given to him <b>as a gift</b> in such a scenario? <b>Rabbi Abba bar Kahana accepted</b> the premise of the dilemma <b>of</b> Rabbi Yirmeya, and ruled that in the case of a gift one acquires the animals <b>even if he</b> would <b>not</b> be able to <b>run after them and catch them. What is the reason</b> for this distinction? Is it <b>not because</b> when <b>another mind transfers their ownership,</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>is different,</b> in that the courtyard effects acquisition of the items with fewer limitations? This supports Rav Pappa’s explanation.

### Part 9
<b>Rav Shimi said to Rav Pappa: But</b> what about the case of <b>a bill of divorce, where another mind,</b> the husband, <b>transfers its ownership</b> to the wife, <b>and</b> nevertheless <b>Ulla says</b> with regard to one who threw a bill of divorce into his wife’s house or courtyard: <b>But it is</b> a valid divorce only if <b>she is standing next to her house or next to her courtyard?</b> Rav Pappa responded: <b>A bill of divorce is different, as it is</b> possible to give it to one’s wife even <b>against her will.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Rav Sheshet, son of Rav Idi, objects to this</b> response: <b>But is it not an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference? <b>If</b> in the case of <b>a bill of divorce, which is</b> valid even if it is given to the wife <b>against her will,</b> nevertheless <b>if she is standing next to her house or next to her courtyard</b> she <b>does</b> acquire the bill of divorce, and <b>if not</b> she does <b>not</b> acquire it, then in the case of <b>a gift, which</b> one can receive only <b>willingly,</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> correct that the recipient must be next to his courtyard for the transaction to take effect?

### Part 11
<b>Rather, Rav Ashi said</b> that the distinction between the cases of a gift and a bill of divorce should be explained as follows:
