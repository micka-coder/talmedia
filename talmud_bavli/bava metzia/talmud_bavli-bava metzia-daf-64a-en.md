### Part 1
For example, if the money was given <b>in</b> units of <b>tens or fives,</b> it can be assumed that the owner of the money counted the coins in groups of tens or fives and erred in his count.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: And if</b> the one who gave the money <b>is a harsh person, who is not</b> accustomed to <b>giving gifts, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Should it be assumed that he made a mistake? Rav Ashi <b>said to him: Perhaps</b> that person once <b>robbed</b> the recipient, <b>and</b> now <b>he included in the calculation</b> the amount he stole, in order to return the stolen money without informing him of the theft. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who robs another and</b> then returns the stolen money by <b>including it in the calculation</b> of money paid for another item <b>has fulfilled</b> his obligation to return the stolen money.

### Part 3
Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, asked Rav Ashi: <b>And if</b> the giver <b>was a person from the outside, with whom</b> the recipient <b>had never conducted business, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Should it be assumed that the additional money was given in error? Rav Ashi <b>said to him: Perhaps another person,</b> an acquaintance of the giver’s, <b>robbed</b> the recipient <b>and said to</b> the giver: <b>When so-and-so borrows money from you, include it in the calculation.</b> It is possible that the one who robbed the recipient chose this manner of restoring the latter’s money in order to be spared any shame.

### Part 4
§ <b>Rav Kahana said: I was sitting at the</b> far <b>end of Rav’s</b> house of <b>study, and I heard him say: Gourds, gourds, but I did not know what</b> he was <b>saying,</b> as I did not hear the entire discussion. <b>After Rav arose</b> and left, <b>I said to</b> the students: <b>What</b> is this statement concerning <b>gourds, gourds, that Rav</b> was <b>saying?</b>

### Part 5
<b>They said to me: This is what Rav</b> was <b>saying:</b> If <b>someone gave money to a gardener</b> to purchase <b>gourds</b> from him, <b>and they were going</b> for the price of <b>ten gourds</b> of the length of <b>a span,</b> i.e., the distance between the thumb and the little finger, <b>for a dinar, and</b> the gardener <b>said to</b> the buyer: If you pay me the money now, <b>I will give you</b> gourds <b>a cubit</b> in length at a later point in time, the <i>halakha</i> depends on the circumstances. If gourds of this larger kind <b>are</b> in the possession of the seller, this type of sale is <b>permitted.</b> If they <b>are not</b> in his possession, it is <b>prohibited,</b> as, if he gives him larger gourds at a later date for the price of small gourds, this constitutes interest.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: Isn’t this <b>obvious?</b> What is the novelty in Rav’s statement? The Gemara answers: The statement is necessary, <b>lest you say: Since they increase</b> in and <b>of themselves</b> it is <b>permitted,</b> as the gardener does not perform any action, but simply waits for the gourds to grow larger before supplying them. Rav therefore <b>teaches us</b> that this is also classified as interest.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion did Rav rule? He ruled <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who went to milk his goats, or shear his sheep, or extract</b> the honey <b>from his hives,</b> if <b>another found him and</b> the farmer <b>said to</b> him: <b>Whatever</b> milk <b>my goats produce</b> is <b>sold to you,</b> or <b>whatever</b> wool <b>will be sheared from my sheep</b> is <b>sold to you,</b> or <b>whatever</b> honey <b>will be extracted from my hive</b> is <b>sold to you,</b> this is <b>permitted.</b> It is permitted despite the fact that the farmer did not specify precisely how much he is selling, and the buyer may receive more of the product than the current market value would dictate due to his paying for it in advance, as he may also receive less of the product than the current market value would dictate.

### Part 8
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>But if</b> the farmer <b>said to him: Such and such</b> an amount of milk from <b>what my goats produce</b> is <b>sold to you,</b> or <b>such and such</b> an amount of wool from <b>what will be sheared from my sheep</b> is <b>sold to you,</b> or <b>such and such</b> an amount of honey from <b>what will be extracted from my hive</b> is <b>sold to you,</b> a transaction of this kind is <b>prohibited,</b> as the farmer is selling him more of the product than the current market value would dictate due to his paying for it in advance. The Gemara states its question: <b>And</b> one sees in this <i>baraita</i> that <b>even though</b> these products <b>increased</b> in value in and <b>of themselves, since they are not</b> in existence <b>at</b> the <b>time</b> of the sale, the practice is <b>forbidden.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara records another version of this discussion: <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>Rava said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> is that <b>since</b> the sold items <b>grow by themselves</b> it is <b>permitted,</b> as it does not constitute interest. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that if he specifies: <b>Such and such</b> an amount, it is <b>forbidden?</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara answers that there is a difference between the two cases: <b>There,</b> with regard to milk and wool, <b>they do not increase</b> in and <b>of themselves.</b> This is evident from the fact <b>that</b> if <b>they remove this</b> milk from the goat, <b>other</b> milk <b>replaces it.</b> Therefore, the milk or wool that is generated after the sale is not an extension of the milk or wool that was present at the time of the sale. Conversely, <b>here,</b> in the case of the gourds, <b>they increase</b> in and <b>of themselves,</b> as the same gourds continue to grow. This is evident from the fact <b>that when they remove this</b> gourd from the ground, <b>no other will replace it.</b> Consequently, if he sells him gourds now, any additional growth belongs to the buyer, as the gourds are in his possession from the moment of acquisition.

### Part 11
§ <b>Abaye said: It is permitted for a person to say to another: Take</b> these <b>four dinars for</b> the future delivery of <b>a barrel of wine; if it sours,</b> it is <b>in your possession</b> and you are responsible, but <b>if it appreciates or depreciates</b> in value, it is <b>in my possession,</b> as I accept any loss that results from a change in price. <b>Rav Sherevya said to Abaye:</b>
