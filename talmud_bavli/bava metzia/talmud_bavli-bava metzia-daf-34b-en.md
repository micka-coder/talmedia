### Part 1
<b>and then said: I will not pay, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say he is retracting</b> his intention to pay and therefore has no right to the double payment? <b>Or, perhaps he stands</b> committed to <b>his</b> initial <b>statement and is</b> merely <b>postponing</b> payment to a later date, in which case he maintains rights to the double payment.

### Part 2
The Gemara raises another dilemma. If the bailee <b>said: I hereby</b> choose to <b>pay, and</b> then he <b>died</b> before paying, <b>and his sons said: We are not paying, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say they are retracting</b> their father’s decision to pay, <b>or perhaps they stand</b> committed to fulfilling <b>their father’s statement and are</b> merely <b>postponing</b> payment to a later date when they will be able to pay?

### Part 3
The Gemara raises another dilemma. If the father died before he declared his willingness to pay and <b>the sons paid, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Can</b> the owner <b>say to them: When I transferred</b> rights to <b>the double payment,</b> I transferred them <b>to your father, who pleased me,</b> but <b>to you,</b> I did <b>not</b> transfer those rights? <b>Or perhaps</b> this case <b>is no different,</b> and the owner transfers rights to the double payment provided that he receives payment, and it does not matter whether it was the bailee or his sons who paid him.

### Part 4
If the owner of the deposit died and the bailee <b>paid</b> the payment <b>to</b> the owner’s <b>sons, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Can</b> the sons <b>say to</b> the bailee: <b>When our father transferred</b> rights to <b>the double payment to you,</b> it was because <b>you pleased him, but</b> as far as <b>we</b> are concerned, you did <b>not</b> please <b>us? Or perhaps it is no different,</b> and the bailee receives the double payment. Likewise, if both the owner and the bailee died, and <b>sons</b> of the bailee <b>paid the sons</b> of the owner, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>?

### Part 5
The Gemara raises additional dilemmas: If the bailee <b>paid half</b> the value of the deposit before the thief was discovered, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? If <b>one borrowed two cows,</b> and they were stolen, and <b>he paid</b> the value <b>of one of them, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? If one <b>borrowed</b> an item <b>from partners, and he paid one of them, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? In the case of <b>partners who borrowed</b> an item <b>and one of them paid, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? If <b>one borrowed</b> an item <b>from a woman and paid her husband, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? In the case of <b>a woman who borrowed</b> an item, <b>and her husband paid, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara concludes: All of these dilemmas <b>shall stand</b> unresolved <b>[<i>teiku</i>]</b>.

### Part 6
§ <b>Rav Huna says:</b> Even if the bailee declares his intention to pay for the deposit, the court <b>administers an oath to him that</b> the item was actually stolen or lost and <b>is not in his possession. What is the reason</b> for this oath? <b>We are concerned</b> that <b>perhaps he coveted</b> that item.

### Part 7
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Shevuot</i> 43a): In the case of <b>one who lends</b> money <b>to another on</b> the basis of <b>collateral, and the collateral was lost, and</b> the creditor <b>says to</b> the debtor: <b>I loaned you a <i>sela</i> on</b> the basis of that collateral and that collateral <b>was worth a shekel,</b> i.e., a half-<i>sela</i>. Therefore you owe me a shekel. <b>And the other</b> individual, the debtor, <b>says</b> in response to that claim: <b>That is not</b> the case. <b>Rather, you loaned me a <i>sela</i> on</b> the basis of that collateral, and the collateral <b>was worth a <i>sela</i>;</b> I owe you nothing. In this case, the debtor is <b>exempt</b> from payment.

### Part 8
The mishna continues: If the creditor claimed: <b>I loaned you a <i>sela</i> on</b> the basis of that collateral <b>and it was worth a shekel. And the other</b> individual, the debtor, <b>says: That is not</b> the case; <b>rather, you loaned me a <i>sela</i> on</b> the basis of that collateral <b>and</b> the collateral <b>was worth three dinars,</b> i.e., three-quarters of a <i>sela</i>. In this case, the debtor is <b>obligated</b> to take an oath, due to the fact that he responded to the claim of the creditor with a partial admission.

### Part 9
The mishna continues: If the debtor said: <b>You loaned me a <i>sela</i> on</b> the basis of that collateral and the collateral <b>was worth two</b> <i>sela</i>, so now you owe me a <i>sela</i>. <b>And the other</b> party, i.e., the creditor, <b>said: That is not</b> the case; <b>rather, I loaned you a <i>sela</i> on</b> the basis of that collateral and the collateral <b>was worth a <i>sela</i>.</b> Here, the creditor is <b>exempt.</b>

### Part 10
If the debtor said: <b>You loaned me a <i>sela</i> on</b> the basis of that collateral and the collateral <b>was worth two</b> <i>sela</i>. <b>And the other</b> party, i.e., the creditor, <b>said: That is not</b> the case; <b>rather, I loaned you a <i>sela</i> on</b> the basis of that collateral and the collateral <b>was worth five dinars.</b> Here, the creditor is <b>obligated</b> to take an oath due to the fact that he responded to the claim of the debtor with a partial admission.

### Part 11
The mishna concludes: <b>Who takes</b> the <b>oath? The one</b> in <b>whose</b> possession <b>the deposit was</b> located, i.e., the creditor, who took collateral from the debtor. The Sages instituted this provision <b>lest this</b> party, i.e., the debtor, <b>take an oath and the other</b> party, i.e., the creditor, <b>produce the deposit</b> and prove the oath false.

### Part 12
The Gemara seeks to clarify the mishna: <b>To which</b> case in the mishna is this <i>halakha</i> referring? <b>If we say</b> it is referring <b>to the latter clause</b> of the mishna, where the debtor claims that the creditor owes him money, the mishna’s explanation is unnecessary: <b>Derive</b> that the obligation to take the <b>oath</b> is incumbent <b>upon the creditor</b> due to the fact <b>that he admits to part of the</b> debtor’s <b>claim,</b> which renders one obligated to take an oath by Torah law. <b>Rather, Shmuel says:</b> This <i>halakha</i> is referring <b>to the first clause</b> of the mishna.

### Part 13
The Gemara clarifies further: <b>What</b> is the meaning of Shmuel’s statement that this <i>halakha</i> is referring <b>to the first clause</b> of the mishna? It is referring <b>to the latter</b> part <b>of the first clause:</b> The creditor says: <b>I loaned you a <i>sela</i> on</b> the basis of that collateral <b>and it was worth a shekel. And the other</b> individual, the debtor, <b>says: That is not</b> the case; <b>rather, you loaned me a <i>sela</i> on</b> the basis of that collateral <b>and</b> the collateral <b>was worth three dinars.</b> Here, the <i>halakha</i> is that the debtor is <b>obligated</b> to take an oath. Fundamentally, the obligation to take <b>the oath is that of the borrower,</b> as he is the one who responds to the creditor’s claim with a partial admission. <b>But the Sages said: Let the creditor take</b> the <b>oath</b> to bolster his claim, <b>lest this</b> party, the debtor, <b>take an oath and the other</b> party, the creditor, <b>produce the deposit.</b>

### Part 14
After explaining this mishna from tractate <i>Shevuot</i>, the Gemara analyzes its connection to the statement of Rav Huna: <b>But if</b>
