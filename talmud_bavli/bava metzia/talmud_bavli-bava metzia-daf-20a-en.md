### Part 1
<b>Conclude from</b> the fact that this suspicion is not taken into account that the <i>halakha</i> <b>of Shmuel is accepted. As Shmuel says:</b> In the case of <b>one who sells a promissory note to another, and</b> the seller <b>then forgives</b> the debt of the debtor, <b>it is forgiven,</b> since the debtor essentially had a non-transferable obligation to the creditor alone, <b>and even</b> the creditor’s <b>heir can forgive</b> the debt. Therefore, if the wife did engage in the deception mentioned above, it was within her rights, as she is able to forgive the debt of the marriage contract.

### Part 2
<b>Abaye said:</b> This is not conclusive proof. <b>Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that the <i>halakha</i> <b>of Shmuel is not</b> accepted, <b>here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> the <b>marriage contract emerges from her possession,</b> which indicates that she did not sell it. <b>And Rava</b> disagreed with Abaye and <b>said: If</b> the reason there is no suspicion that she sold her marriage contract is <b>due to</b> the fact that the <b>marriage contract</b> emerged from her possession, this reason is insufficient, as <b>we</b> should <b>suspect</b> that there might be <b>two marriage contracts.</b>

### Part 3
<b>And Abaye said</b> in response: <b>First, we are not concerned about</b> the remote possibility of <b>two marriage contracts. And furthermore,</b> even if there is only one marriage contract, which was sold before the receipt was given to the husband, the receipt is valid, as <b>a receipt</b> can be used to <b>repossess</b> property <b>from</b> the <b>time</b> it was written, even if it was given on a later date. In saying this, <b>Abaye</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as he says</b> that once a monetary document is written for someone, <b>the document’s witnesses, with their signatures, acquire</b> it <b>on his behalf.</b>

### Part 4
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one <b>found documents of appraisal</b> of a debtor’s property for the purpose of debt collection; <b>or documents concerning food,</b> which were drawn up when one accepted upon himself to provide sustenance for another; <b>documents of <i>ḥalitza</i>; or</b> documents of <b>refusal</b> of a girl upon reaching majority to remain married to the man to whom her mother or brothers married her as a minor after the death of her father; <b>or documents of <i>beirurin</i>,</b> a concept that will be explained in the Gemara; <b>or any court enactment,</b> e.g., a promissory note that has been authenticated by the court, in all of these cases, the finder <b>must return</b> the document to its presumed owner.

### Part 5
If one <b>found</b> documents <b>in a <i>ḥafisa</i> or in a <i>deluskema</i>,</b> both of them types of containers, or if he found <b>a roll of documents or a bundle of documents, he must return</b> them. <b>And how many</b> documents are considered to be <b>a bundle of documents?</b> It is <b>three</b> that are <b>tied together. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> If the documents make reference to loans of <b>one</b> person <b>who borrowed</b> money <b>from three</b> people, the finder <b>must return</b> them <b>to the debtor,</b> as they were presumably in his possession before being lost. If the documents make reference to loans of <b>three</b> people <b>who borrowed</b> money <b>from one</b> person, <b>he must return</b> them <b>to the creditor,</b> as they were presumably in his possession before being lost.

### Part 6
If one <b>found a document among his documents</b> that were given to him by other people as a trustee, <b>and he does not know what its nature is,</b> i.e., he does not remember who gave it to him or whether the debt mentioned in it has been paid, the document <b>is placed</b> aside <b>until Elijah</b> the prophet <b>comes</b> and clarifies the issue through his prophecy. <b>If there are cancellations of contracts [<i>simponot</i>] among them, he should do what</b> is stated <b>in the <i>simponot</i>.</b>

### Part 7
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What</b> is meant by <b>documents of <i>beirurin</i>? Here,</b> in Babylonia, the Sages <b>interpret</b> it to mean <b>documents</b> recording each litigant’s clarification [<i>beirur</i>] <b>of</b> his <b>claims</b> in a court case. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya,</b> who lived in Eretz Yisrael, <b>said:</b> It is referring to cases where <b>this</b> litigant <b>chooses [<i>borer</i>] one</b> judge, <b>and that</b> litigant <b>chooses one</b> judge, and they choose the third judge for the case. The two litigants sign a document in which they declare which judges they choose.

### Part 8
§ The Gemara addresses that which the mishna states: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>any court enactment,</b> the one who found it <b>must return</b> it to its presumed owner. The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain bill of divorce that was found</b> in <b>the court of Rav Huna, in which it was written</b> that the bill of divorce was written <b>in Sheviri City, which is</b> located <b>on the Rakhis River. Rav Huna said</b> about this:
