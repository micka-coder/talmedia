there are <b>times that both</b> are liable <b>to</b> bring <b>a guilt-offering;</b> there are <b>times that the renter</b> is liable <b>to</b> bring <b>a sin-offering and the borrower</b> is liable <b>to</b> bring <b>a guilt-offering;</b> there are <b>times that the renter</b> is liable <b>to</b> bring <b>a guilt-offering and the borrower</b> is liable <b>to</b> bring <b>a sin-offering.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara elaborates: <b>How so?</b> One who takes a false oath that involves the <b>denial of a monetary matter</b> is liable to bring <b>a guilt-offering.</b> One who takes a false oath on <b>an utterance of the lips</b> that involves no denial of a monetary debt is liable to bring <b>a sin-offering.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara elaborates: There are <b>times that both</b> are liable <b>to</b> bring <b>a sin-offering.</b> This is in a case <b>where</b> the cow <b>died in its</b> typical <b>manner and</b> the renter and the borrower both <b>said</b> that it died <b>due</b> to circumstances <b>beyond his control. A renter,</b> who <b>in any case is exempt</b> from paying whether it died of natural causes or due to circumstances beyond his control, is liable <b>to</b> bring <b>a sin-offering</b> if he took a false oath. <b>A borrower,</b> who <b>in any case is liable</b> to pay regardless of the circumstances of its death, is liable <b>to</b> bring <b>a sin-offering</b> if he took a false oath. In both cases, the oath involved no denial of monetary debt.

### Part 4
There are <b>times that both</b> are liable <b>to</b> bring <b>a guilt-offering.</b> This is in a case <b>where</b> the cow <b>was stolen</b> from a borrower, <b>and</b> the renter and the borrower both <b>said</b> that <b>it died due to</b> ordinary <b>labor.</b> That is a case <b>where both denied a monetary matter, as they are</b> both <b>liable</b> to pay in a case of theft, <b>and</b> both take an oath on a claim with which they seek to <b>exempt themselves.</b>

### Part 5
There are times when <b>a renter</b> is liable <b>to</b> bring <b>a sin-offering and a borrower</b> is liable <b>to</b> bring <b>a guilt-offering.</b> This is in a case <b>where</b> the cow <b>died in its</b> typical <b>manner and</b> the renter and the borrower both <b>said</b> that <b>it died due to</b> ordinary <b>labor. A renter, who in any case is exempt,</b> as he is exempt from paying in cases where the ox was damaged or died due to circumstances beyond his control, is <b>liable to</b> bring <b>a sin-offering,</b> as the false oath involved no denial of monetary debt. <b>A borrower, who is liable</b> to pay when the cow <b>died in its</b> typical <b>manner and</b> attempted <b>to exempt himself</b> with the claim that <b>it died due to</b> ordinary <b>labor,</b> is liable <b>to</b> bring <b>a guilt-offering.</b>

### Part 6
There are times when <b>a renter</b> is liable <b>to</b> bring <b>a guilt-offering and a borrower</b> is liable <b>to</b> bring <b>a sin-offering.</b> This is in a case <b>where</b> the cow <b>was stolen</b> from the borrower, <b>and</b> the renter and the borrower both <b>said</b> that it <b>died in its</b> typical <b>manner. The renter, who is liable</b> to pay in cases of <b>theft and loss and</b> attempted <b>to exempt himself</b> with the claim that it <b>died in its</b> typical <b>manner,</b> is liable <b>to</b> bring <b>a guilt-offering. A borrower, who in any case is liable</b> to pay, is liable <b>to</b> bring <b>a sin-offering.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Rabbi Yirmeya <b>teaching us</b> with this systematic presentation of these cases? They are merely details based on established halakhic principles. The Gemara answers: His statement serves <b>to exclude</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ami, who says:</b> With regard to <b>any oath that the judges administer, one is not liable</b> to bring a sin-offering for taking a false <b>oath</b> on <b>an utterance, as it is stated</b> in the passage concerning the obligation to bring an offering for taking a false oath: <b>“Or if a soul takes an oath clearly to utter with lips”</b> (Leviticus 5:4). The Gemara infers: The liability to bring an offering for taking a false oath applies only to one <b>who takes an oath on his own</b> initiative, but not when the oath is administered by others. Rabbi Yirmeya <b>teaches us that</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ami,</b> as one is liable to bring a sin-offering for taking a false oath on an utterance even if it was administered by another.

### Part 8
<b>It was stated</b> that there is an amoraic dispute with regard to <b>a bailee who conveyed to</b> another <b>bailee</b> the deposit with which he was entrusted. <b>Rav says:</b> He is <b>exempt</b> from payment in the same cases in which he is exempt when the deposit is in his possession. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> He is <b>liable</b> to pay even in cases of damage due to circumstances beyond his control.

### Part 9
<b>Abaye says:</b> According <b>to Rav’s</b> line of <b>reasoning, it is not necessary</b> to state his ruling in a case where he was initially <b>an unpaid bailee who conveyed</b> the deposit for safeguarding <b>to a paid bailee, as</b> in that case the unpaid bailee <b>enhanced</b> the level of <b>his safeguarding,</b> since a paid bailee is liable to pay in instances where an unpaid bailee is exempt. <b>But even</b> in the case of <b>a paid bailee who conveyed</b> the deposit for safeguarding <b>to an unpaid bailee, where</b> the paid bailee <b>diminished</b> the level of <b>his safeguarding,</b> he is <b>exempt. What is the reason?</b> He is exempt <b>because he conveyed</b> the deposit <b>to a mentally competent person,</b> thereby effectively safeguarded the deposit.

### Part 10
According <b>to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s</b> line of <b>reasoning, it is not necessary</b> to state his ruling in a case where he was initially <b>a paid bailee who conveyed</b> the deposit for safeguarding <b>to an unpaid bailee, as</b> the paid bailee <b>diminished</b> the level of <b>his safeguarding,</b> since an unpaid bailee is exempt in instances where a paid bailee is liable to pay. <b>But even</b> in the case of <b>an unpaid bailee who conveyed</b> the deposit for safeguarding <b>to a paid bailee, where</b> the unpaid bailee <b>enhanced</b> the level of <b>his safeguarding,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to pay. What is the reason? He is liable <b>because</b> the owner of the deposit <b>said to him: It is not my desire that my deposit be in the possession of another</b> bailee.

### Part 11
<b>Rav Ḥisda said: This</b> statement <b>that</b> is attributed to <b>Rav was not stated explicitly. Rather,</b> it was <b>inferred</b> from another statement of his, <b>as</b> it is related: There were <b>these gardeners who each day would deposit their spades with a certain old woman. One day they deposited</b> their spades <b>with one of</b> gardeners. He <b>heard noise</b> from <b>a wedding hall</b> and set <b>out</b> and went there. <b>He deposited</b> the spades <b>with that old woman. In</b> the time <b>that he went and came</b> back from the wedding, <b>their spades were stolen.</b>

### Part 12
The case <b>came before Rav, and</b> Rav <b>exempted</b> the gardener who deposited the spades with the old woman. <b>One who observed</b> Rav’s ruling <b>thought</b> that Rav issued that ruling <b>due to</b> the fact that <b>a bailee who conveyed</b> a deposit <b>to</b> another <b>bailee is exempt. But</b> that <b>is not so. There,</b> in the case of the spades, it <b>is different, as</b> the gardeners <b>themselves would deposit</b> their spades <b>with that old woman.</b> Since the gardeners cannot claim that it is not their desire for their deposit to be in the possession of this old woman, the gardener who did so is exempt.

### Part 13
The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Ami sat and stated this <i>halakha</i>. Rabbi Abba bar Memel raised an objection to Rabbi Ami</b> from the mishna: In the case of <b>one who rents a cow from another, and</b> this renter <b>lends it to another</b> person, <b>and</b> the cow <b>dies in its</b> typical <b>manner</b> in the possession of the borrower, the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>the renter takes an oath</b> to the owner of the cow <b>that</b> the cow <b>died in its</b> typical <b>manner, and the borrower pays the renter</b> for the cow that he borrowed. <b>And if</b> the statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>is so, let</b> the owner <b>say</b> to the renter: <b>It is not my desire that my deposit be in the possession of another</b> bailee, and the renter should be liable to pay because he violated the owner’s wishes. Rabbi Ami <b>said to him: With what are we dealing here?</b> It is a case <b>where the owner gave</b> the renter <b>permission to lend</b> the deposit to another.

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> the borrower <b>should be required to pay the owners,</b> as the owner sanctioned the borrowing. Rabbi Abba bar Memel answers: The case in the mishna is one <b>where</b> the owner <b>said to</b> the renter: Lend this deposit to another <b>at your discretion.</b> Therefore, it is not considered as if the owner lent it to the borrower.

### Part 15
<b>Rami bar Ḥama raises an objection</b> from a mishna (42a): In the case of <b>one who deposited coins with another,</b> and that bailee <b>bound it</b> in a cloth <b>and slung it behind him,</b> or <b>conveyed them to his minor son or daughter</b> for safeguarding, <b>or locked</b> the door <b>before</b> the coins <b>in an inappropriate,</b> i.e., insufficient, manner to secure them, the bailee is <b>liable</b> to pay for the coins, <b>as he did not safeguard</b> the coins <b>in the manner</b> typical <b>of bailees.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> he is liable to pay is <b>that</b> he conveyed the coins to his <b>minor</b> children, <b>but</b> if he conveyed them to his <b>adult</b> son or daughter he is <b>exempt. Why? Let the</b> owner <b>say to him</b> as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: <b>It is not my desire that my deposit be in the possession of another</b> bailee, and therefore even if the children are adults the bailee should be liable to pay.

### Part 17
<b>Rava said:</b> No proof can be cited, as it is clear that in the case of <b>anyone who deposits</b> an item with another,
