### Part 1
It was <b>during the era of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi that the beginning of <b>this <i>baraita</i></b> extolling the study of Talmud <b>was taught.</b> The result was that <b>everyone abandoned</b> study of the <b>Mishna and pursued</b> the study of <b>the Talmud.</b> It was <b>then</b> that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>taught</b> them: <b>And always pursue</b> study <b>of</b> the <b>Mishna more than</b> study of <b>the Talmud,</b> as without a firm basis in the fundamental <i>halakhot</i> of the Mishna, talmudic discourse is futile.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: On the basis of <b>what homiletic interpretation</b> did the <i>tanna</i> state that there is no virtue greater than the study of Talmud? It <b>is</b> just <b>as Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Elai, interpreted homiletically: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “Cry aloud, spare not, lift up your voice like a horn, and <b>declare to My people their transgression and to the house of Jacob their sins”</b> (Isaiah 58:1)?

### Part 3
In the phrase <b>“declare to My people their transgression,” these</b> people <b>are the Torah scholars, whose unwitting</b> transgressions <b>become for them tantamount to intentional</b> transgressions. Due to their erudition, they are held to a higher standard. <b>“And to the house of Jacob their sins,” these are the ignoramuses, whose intentional</b> transgressions <b>become for them tantamount to unwitting</b> transgressions. Due to their lack of erudition, they are held to a lower standard. <b>And that is</b> the basis of that which <b>we learned</b> in a mishna (Avot 4:13), that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Be careful in</b> the study of <b>the Talmud, as</b> a transgression based on <b>an unwitting</b> misinterpretation of the <b>Talmud is considered an intentional</b> transgression.

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Elai, interpreted</b> a verse <b>homiletically. What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “Hear the word of the Lord, you who tremble at His word: Your brothers that hate you, that ostracize you for My name’s sake, have said: Let the Lord be glorified, that we may gaze upon your joy, but they shall be ashamed” (Isaiah 66:5)? <b>“Hear the word of the Lord, you who tremble at His word,” these are Torah scholars; “your brothers…have said,” these are masters of the Bible,</b> who are aware of their shortcomings and treat the Torah scholars with deference; <b>“that hate you,” these are masters of Mishna,</b> who consider themselves the equals of Torah scholars and resent the fact that the Torah scholars do not treat them as equals; <b>“that ostracize you,” these are ignoramuses,</b> who distance themselves with their actions from the Torah scholars.

### Part 5
<b>Lest you say,</b> with regard to those groups who are not Torah scholars, that <b>their hope has ceased and their chances are eliminated, the verse states: “That we may gaze upon your joy.”</b> All of the Jewish people, including the groups listed above, will gaze upon the joy of the Torah scholars. <b>Lest you say that the Jewish people will be ashamed, the verse states: “But they shall be ashamed,”</b> meaning that <b>gentiles will be ashamed, but the Jewish people will be joyous.</b>
