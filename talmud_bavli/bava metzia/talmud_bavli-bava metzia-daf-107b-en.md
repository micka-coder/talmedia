### Part 1
In any case, it is evident that Rav approves of one whose property is located near a city. How does this accord with his statement that there is concern for the evil eye when one’s field is viewed by people? The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> statement is referring to <b>a wall and</b> an additional <b>partition [<i>ritka</i>] that surround</b> the plot and prevent it from being harmed by the evil eye. <b>That</b> statement is referring to a case <b>where a wall and</b> an additional <b>partition do not surround it.</b>

### Part 2
§ The Gemara returns to expounding the themes of blessings and the evil eye. The Torah states: <b>“And the Lord will take away from you all sickness”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:15). In interpreting this verse, <b>Rav says: This</b> verse is speaking about the evil <b>eye.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>Rav</b> conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as Rav went to a graveyard,</b> and <b>did what</b> he <b>did,</b> i.e., he used an incantation to find out how those buried there died, and he <b>said: Ninety-nine</b> of these died <b>by the evil eye, and</b> only <b>one</b> died <b>by</b> entirely <b>natural means.</b>

### Part 3
<b>And Shmuel says: This</b> term: “All sickness,” refers to <b>the wind.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>Shmuel</b> conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as Shmuel says: Every</b> injury suffered by people is due <b>to the wind</b> that enters wounds and bodily cavities. The Gemara asks: <b>But according to Shmuel, aren’t there</b> those <b>executed by the monarchy</b> and others killed by traumatic injury and not the wind? The Gemara responds: With regard to <b>these too, were it not</b> for <b>the wind, they would prepare a medicine for</b> those injured people <b>and</b> they would be healed and <b>live,</b> but the wind prevents this from happening.

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina says: This</b> phrase: “All sickness,” refers to <b>the cold, as Rabbi Ḥanina says: All</b> occurrences that befall man are <b>at the hands of Heaven, except for</b> excess <b>cold</b> and <b>heat, as it is stated: “Cold and heat are on the path of the perverse; he who guards his soul shall keep far from them”</b> (Proverbs 22:5). This indicates that cold and heat are forms of harm caused by man, from which one can protect himself.

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina says: This</b> phrase: “All sickness,” refers to <b>excrement, as the Master says:</b> With regard to <b>excrement of the nose,</b> i.e., mucous<b>, and excrement of the ear,</b> i.e., earwax, if a large amount is emitted, having <b>much of it</b> is <b>harmful, but</b> having <b>a bit of it</b> is <b>beneficial.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Elazar says: This</b> term: “All sickness,” refers to <b>the gall bladder.</b> The Gemara adds: <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the term: <b>“Sickness,” this</b> refers to <b>the gall bladder. And why</b> is the gall bladder <b>called sickness?</b> It is <b>because it makes a person’s entire body ill. Alternatively,</b> it is called <b>sickness because eighty-three diseases,</b> the numerical value of <i>maḥala</i>, sickness, <b>are dependent on the gall bladder.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all of them,</b> consuming <b>bread</b> in <b>the morning with salt and</b> drinking <b>a large jug of water negates their</b> ill effects, as a simple morning meal is beneficial to the body.

### Part 7
§ The Gemara cites a related <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Sages taught</b> that <b>thirteen matters</b> of praise <b>were stated with regard to</b> a meal of <b>bread</b> eaten in <b>the morning:</b> It <b>protects</b> the diner <b>from the heat, and from the cold, and from the winds, and from the harmful spirits; and it makes the simple wise, and</b> one who consumes it will be <b>victorious in judgment,</b> he will merit <b>to learn Torah and to teach</b> it, <b>and his statements are heard, and his study will remain in his possession.</b>

### Part 8
In addition, <b>his flesh does not generate</b> excess <b>sweat, and he engages in intercourse with his wife</b> at the proper time, <b>and he does not lust for another woman, and</b> this meal is so advantageous that it even <b>kills</b> any <b>louse in</b> his <b>intestines. And some say</b> it <b>even removes jealousy and brings in love.</b> Since he is completely healthy, he is not inclined to be angered by others.

### Part 9
In relation to the above <i>baraita</i>, <b>Rabba said to Rava bar Mari: From where is this matter that people say</b> derived: <b>Sixty runners ran but could not catch the man who ate in the morning, and the Sages</b> likewise <b>said: Arise early and eat, in the summer due to the sun and in the winter due to the cold,</b> so that one’s body should have the strength to withstand the climate.

### Part 10
Rava bar Mari <b>said to him:</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written: “They shall not hunger nor thirst, neither shall the heat nor sun smite them”</b> (Isaiah 49:10). Why will <b>the heat and the sun not smite them? Since they shall not hunger nor thirst,</b> as they rose early to eat.

### Part 11
Rava <b>said to him: You said to me</b> that it is derived <b>from there, but I say to you</b> that it is derived <b>from here,</b> a different verse: <b>“And you shall serve the Lord your God, and He will bless your bread and your water”</b> (Exodus 23:25), which he interprets as follows: <b>“And you shall serve the Lord your God,” this</b> refers to the <b>recitation of <i>Shema</i> and</b> the <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer,</b> both of which constitute daily service of God. <b>“And He will bless your bread and your water,” this</b> refers to <b>bread with salt and a large jug of water</b> consumed after morning prayers. <b>From that</b> point <b>onward,</b> the rest of the verse: <b>“And I will take sickness away from your midst,”</b> will be fulfilled.

### Part 12
§ <b>Rav Yehuda said to Rav Adda the surveyor</b>: <b>Do not treat measuring lightly</b> even for small areas of land, <b>as each little bit</b> is <b>suitable for</b> growing the <b>cultivated [<i>rishka</i>] saffron,</b> a very expensive product. <b>Rav Yehuda</b> further <b>said to Rav Adda the surveyor:</b> With regard to the <b>four cubits</b> measured adjacent to an irrigation <b>channel,</b> you <b>may treat them lightly,</b> and it is not necessary to provide an exact measurement of them when calculating the areas of fields. And as for the four cubits adjacent <b>to a river,</b> do <b>not measure them at all,</b> but simply estimate the size and include them in the larger measurement.

### Part 13
The Gemara comments: In this regard, <b>Rav Yehuda</b> conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as Rav Yehuda says:</b> The <b>four cubits</b> adjacent <b>to a channel</b> belong <b>to the residents of</b> the houses alongside <b>the channel,</b> while the four cubits adjacent <b>to a river</b> belong <b>to everyone.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Rabbi Ami</b> would <b>announce: Cut down</b> the trees along the width of the <b>full shoulders</b> of <b>the pullers</b> of the boat <b>on both sides</b> of <b>the river</b> so that the trees should not interfere with the pulling of the boats. The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Natan bar Hoshaya</b> instructed people to <b>cut down sixteen cubits</b> on each side of the river, and <b>the residents of Mashronya came upon him and beat him</b> for issuing this directive. The Gemara explains: <b>He holds</b> that any pathway must be made as wide as <b>like a public domain,</b> which is sixteen cubits wide. <b>But</b> that <b>is not so,</b> as <b>there,</b> in the case of a public domain, <b>we</b> do <b>require that much</b> space; <b>here,</b> however, the space <b>is</b> necessary needs to be only enough <b>to</b> enable <b>the stretching of the ropes</b> to pull the boats. Therefore, the width of the <b>full shoulders of the pullers is</b> the <b>sufficient</b> measure of space needed in order not to interfere with the pulling of the boats.

### Part 15
The Gemara relates another incident: <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna had a certain forest on the bank of a river. They said to him: Let the Master cut down</b> the trees on the riverbank in accordance with the above statement. Rabba bar Rav Huna <b>said to them:</b> Let <b>those above and below</b> me along the river <b>cut down</b> their trees first, <b>and then I will cut down</b> my trees. I will achieve nothing by cutting down my trees on my own. The Gemara asks: <b>How can he do so,</b> i.e., wait for others to act? <b>But isn’t it written: “Gather yourselves together, and gather [<i>hitkosheshu vakoshu</i>]”</b> (Zephaniah 2:1), <b>and Reish Lakish says</b> concerning this: <b>Adorn [<i>keshot</i>] yourself and afterward adorn others.</b> Therefore, one must first perform the required action himself before offering advice to others.

### Part 16
The Gemara responds: <b>There</b> it <b>was the forest of the house of Parzak, the general, and</b> it was obvious that they would pay no attention to a Jewish scholar. Rabba bar Rav Huna therefore <b>said: If</b> the workers of the Persian officer <b>cut down, I will cut down</b> as well, <b>and if</b> they do <b>not cut down, why should I cut down</b> for no purpose? <b>Since if</b> the pullers can <b>stretch their ropes they can go</b> along this side of the river,
