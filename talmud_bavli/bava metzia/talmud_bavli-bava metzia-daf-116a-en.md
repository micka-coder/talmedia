### Part 1
<b>is superfluous</b> and therefore includes other utensils as well. <b>Since it is superfluous, apply it</b> as another prohibition <b>upon the lower and upper millstones.</b>

### Part 2
<b>But here,</b> with regard to the Paschal offering, the phrase <b>“but roasted with fire” is not superfluous, as he requires it for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>At the time when one is included in</b> the mitzva <b>to arise</b> and <b>eat</b> the <b>roasted</b> Paschal offering, <b>he is</b> also <b>included in</b> the prohibition <b>not to eat</b> of it <b>raw,</b> but <b>at a time when one is not included in</b> the mitzva <b>to arise</b> and <b>eat the roasted</b> Paschal offering, <b>he is not</b> included <b>in</b> the prohibition <b>not to eat</b> of it <b>raw</b> either. Consequently, one who eats the Paschal offering at that time is not liable to receive lashes.

### Part 3
§ The Gemara returns to the dispute concerning the lower and upper millstones. It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Yehuda:</b> If one <b>took as collateral barbers’ scissors [<i>zog</i>] or a pair of cows,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to receive <b>two</b> sets of lashes. If he took <b>this</b> one blade of the pair of scissors <b>by itself or that</b> one cow <b>by itself,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to receive <b>only one</b> set of lashes. According to this <i>tanna</i>, he is not liable for the general prohibition.

### Part 4
<b>And</b> it <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>took as collateral barbers’ scissors or a pair of cows,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that he is <b>liable</b> to receive <b>only one</b> set of lashes. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “He may not take as collateral the lower or upper millstone,”</b> which indicates that <b>just as the lower and upper millstones are unique</b> in that they are <b>two</b> distinct <b>vessels and</b> they <b>perform one task</b> together, and nevertheless one is <b>liable separately for this and separately for that, so too,</b> with regard to <b>all items that are</b> composed of <b>two individual vessels,</b> such as barbers’ scissors or a pair of cows, <b>and</b> they <b>perform one task,</b> he is <b>liable separately for this and separately for that.</b>

### Part 5
§ The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain man who took as collateral a slaughtering knife from another. He came before Abaye</b> to ask him what to do. Abaye <b>said to him: Go</b> and <b>return it, as it is a vessel used in the preparation of food,</b> and it is therefore forbidden to take as collateral, <b>and go stand in judgment,</b> i.e., litigate with the debtor in court, <b>concerning</b> how much money he owes you. <b>Rava said:</b> He does <b>not have to stand in judgment for this.</b> Since the knife is in his possession, <b>he can claim</b> the amount of the debt <b>up to its value.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>And does Abaye not accept that reasoning,</b> that one who seized an item belonging to a debtor may claim the sum owed to him up to the value of the item? In <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> it <b>different from</b> the incident involving <b>those goats that ate peeled barley [<i>ḥushla</i>] in Neharde’a, and the owner of the peeled barley came and seized</b> the goats and <b>claimed</b> that their owner was indebted to him for <b>a large</b> amount, <b>and Shmuel’s father,</b> who acted as a judge in this case, <b>said</b> that <b>he can claim</b> a sum <b>up to their value?</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara answers that there is a difference between the two cases: <b>There,</b> a goat <b>is an item that</b> is <b>not usually lent</b> out <b>or rented.</b> Consequently, the one who possesses them has a presumptive right of ownership upon which he can base his claim. Conversely, <b>here,</b> the slaughtering knife is <b>an item that</b> is <b>usually lent</b> out <b>or rented.</b> Therefore, he is not deemed credible without proof that it is his merely by virtue of its being in his possession. The Gemara supports this distinction: <b>As Rav Huna bar Avin sent</b> the following ruling: In a case of <b>items that are usually lent</b> out <b>or rented, and</b> one in possession of them <b>says: They were acquired by me, he is not deemed credible</b> by this claim alone. He must provide further proof, as he might have borrowed or rented them.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rava not accept this reasoning? But didn’t Rava</b> himself <b>remove scissors</b> used <b>for wool and a scroll of <i>aggada</i> from</b> the possession of <b>orphans as items that are usually lent</b> out <b>or rented?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Rava</b> could have <b>said to you:</b> With regard to <b>this</b> slaughtering knife <b>too, since</b> it is likely to <b>be damaged, people are particular and do not lend</b> it out. Therefore, it is not considered an item that is typically lent out, and the one in possession of it can claim the money owed to him up to the value of the knife.
