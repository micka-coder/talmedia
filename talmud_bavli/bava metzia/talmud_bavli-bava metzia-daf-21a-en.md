### Part 1
<b>as we ask the witnesses whether</b> the loan was <b>repaid</b> or <b>whether</b> it was <b>not repaid.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another challenge from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A <i>simpon</i> upon which witnesses</b> are signed is <b>valid.</b> Apparently, it is valid even if it is found in the possession of the creditor, as no distinction is made. The Gemara answers: To <b>what witnesses</b> is the <i>baraita</i> referring? It is referring to <b>witnesses of ratification.</b> The fact that the <i>simpon</i> was ratified by the court proves its validity.

### Part 3
The Gemara notes that <b>this too stands to reason, from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> in <b>the latter clause: And</b> a <i>simpon</i> <b>upon which witnesses</b> are <b>not</b> signed is <b>invalid. What</b> is meant by the expression: <b>Upon which witnesses</b> are <b>not</b> signed? <b>If we say</b> that it means <b>that there are no witnesses</b> signed <b>on it at all,</b> does it <b>need to be said that</b> it is <b>invalid? Rather, is it not</b> referring to a <i>simpon</i> on which witnesses are signed, just not <b>witnesses of ratification?</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>itself</b> cited above: <b>A <i>simpon</i> upon which witnesses</b> are signed <b>is ratified by</b> means of <b>its signatories.</b> If <b>there are no witnesses</b> signed <b>on it, but</b> the <i>simpon</i> <b>emerges from the possession of a third party</b> serving as a trustee, <b>or</b> if <b>it emerges after the signing of</b> the <b>documents,</b> i.e., the <i>simpon</i> was written on the promissory note beneath the content of the note and the witnesses’ signatures, it is <b>valid.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara explains: The reason that it is valid if it <b>emerges from the possession of a third party</b> is <b>that</b> the <b>creditor granted credibility to</b> the <b>third party</b> by placing the <i>simpon</i> in his possession. <b>So too,</b> the <i>simpon</i> is valid in a case where <b>it emerges after the signing of</b> the <b>documents, as, if not</b> for the fact <b>that</b> the debt <b>was repaid,</b> the creditor <b>would not have undermined his note</b> by allowing the <i>simpon</i> to be written on it.

### Part 7
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In a case where one discovers lost items, <b>which found items</b> belong <b>to him, and</b> for <b>which</b> items is <b>one obligated to proclaim</b> his find so that the owner of the lost items can come and reclaim them?

### Part 8
<b>These found items</b> belong <b>to him:</b> If one <b>found scattered produce, scattered coins, bundles</b> of grain <b>in a public area, round cakes</b> of pressed <b>figs, baker’s loaves, strings of fish, cuts of meat,</b> unprocessed <b>wool fleeces that are taken from their state</b> of origin directly after shearing, bound <b>flax stalks, or</b> bound <b>strips of</b> combed <b>purple wool, these</b> belong <b>to him,</b> as they have no distinguishing marks that would enable their owners to claim them. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If one finds <b>any</b> lost item <b>in which there is an alteration,</b> he is <b>obligated to proclaim</b> his find. <b>How so?</b> If he <b>found a round</b> cake of pressed figs with an <b>earthenware</b> shard <b>inside it</b> or <b>a loaf</b> of bread <b>with coins inside it,</b> he is obligated to proclaim his find, as perhaps the owner of the item inserted them as a distinguishing mark by means of which he could reclaim his property in case it became lost.

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> If one finds <b>any <i>anpurya</i> vessels,</b> since their shape is uniform and they are indistinguishable, he is <b>not obligated to proclaim</b> his find.

### Part 11
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches as an example of items that one finds without any distinguishing mark: If one <b>found scattered produce.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And how much</b> produce in how large an area constitutes scattered produce? <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says:</b> It is considered scattered produce when it has a dispersal ratio of one <b><i>kav</i> in</b> an area of <b>four</b> by four <b>cubits.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances? If</b> he found the produce scattered in <b>a manner</b> indicating that it came there by <b>falling</b> and was not deliberately placed there, then <b>even</b> if the volume of produce in that area was <b>greater</b> than this limit, it should <b>also</b> belong to him, because there is no distinguishing mark that would enable the owner to reclaim it. <b>And if</b> he found produce scattered in <b>a manner</b> indicating intentional <b>placement,</b> then <b>even</b> if the volume of produce in an area that size was <b>less</b> than this limit, he should <b>also not</b> be allowed to keep the produce, as clearly the owner plans on returning to reclaim his produce.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Ukva bar Ḥama said: We are dealing with</b> kernels of wheat that remained during <b>the gathering</b> of grain <b>on the threshing floor.</b> For kernels scattered with a dispersal ratio of one <b><i>kav</i> in</b> an area of <b>four</b> by four <b>cubits, whose</b> gathering requires <b>great exertion, a person does not exert</b> himself <b>and does not return</b> and <b>take them.</b> Therefore, <b>he renounces</b> his <b>ownership</b> of <b>them</b> and one who finds the kernels may keep them. For kernels scattered in an area <b>smaller than that,</b> the owner <b>exerts</b> himself <b>and returns</b> and <b>takes them. And</b> therefore, <b>he does not renounce</b> his <b>ownership</b> of <b>them.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises a dilemma:</b> If <b>a half-<i>kav</i></b> of kernels were scattered <b>in</b> an area of <b>two</b> by four <b>cubits, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The aspects of the dilemma are: In the case of one <b><i>kav</i></b> of kernels <b>scattered in an area of four</b> by four <b>cubits, what is the reason</b> that the owner renounces his ownership of the kernels? It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> gathering the kernels requires <b>great exertion.</b> In the case of <b>a half-<i>kav</i></b> of kernels scattered <b>in</b> an area of <b>two</b> by four <b>cubits, since</b> gathering <b>them</b> does <b>not</b> require <b>great exertion,</b> he does <b>not renounce</b> his <b>ownership</b> of <b>them. Or perhaps,</b> the owner renounces ownership in the case of one <b><i>kav</i></b> of kernels <b>scattered in an area of four</b> by four <b>cubits due to</b> the fact <b>that they are not</b> of <b>significant</b> value. In the case of <b>a half-<i>kav</i></b> of kernels scattered <b>in</b> an area of <b>two</b> by four <b>cubits, since</b> they are certainly <b>not</b> of <b>significant</b> value, <b>he renounces</b> his <b>ownership</b> of the kernels.

### Part 15
Rabbi Yirmeya raises a related dilemma: If <b>two <i>kav</i></b> of kernels were scattered <b>in</b> an area of <b>eight</b> by four <b>cubits, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The aspects of the dilemma are: If <b>one <i>kav</i></b> of kernels is scattered <b>in an area of four</b> by four <b>cubits, what is the reason</b> that the owner renounces ownership? It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> gathering <b>them</b> requires <b>great exertion.</b> This is true <b>all the more so</b> in the case of <b>two <i>kav</i></b> of kernels scattered <b>in</b> an area of <b>eight</b> by four <b>cubits,</b> and <b>since</b> gathering <b>them</b> requires <b>even greater exertion,</b> the owner <b>renounces</b> his <b>ownership</b> of <b>them. Or perhaps,</b> the owner renounces his ownership in the case of one <i>kav</i> of kernels <b>scattered in an area of four</b> by four <b>cubits due to</b> the fact <b>that they are not</b> of <b>significant</b> value. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>two <i>kav</i></b> of kernels scattered <b>in</b> an area of <b>eight</b> by four <b>cubits, since they are</b> of <b>significant</b> value, he <b>does not renounce</b> his <b>ownership</b> of <b>them.</b>

### Part 16
If one <b><i>kav</i> of sesame</b> seeds was scattered <b>in</b> an area of <b>four</b> by four <b>cubits, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The aspects of the dilemma are: In the case of one <b><i>kav</i></b> of kernels scattered <b>in</b> an area of <b>four</b> by four <b>cubits, what is the reason</b> that the owner renounces ownership? It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that they are not</b> of <b>significant</b> value. <b>And</b> in the case of <b>sesame</b> seeds, <b>since they are</b> of <b>significant</b> value he <b>does not renounce</b> his <b>ownership</b> of <b>them. Or perhaps,</b> the owner renounces ownership in the case of one <i>kav</i> of kernels scattered <b>in</b> an area of <b>four</b> by four <b>cubits due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> gathering <b>them</b> requires <b>great exertion.</b> That is true <b>all the more so</b> in the case of <b>sesame</b> seeds. <b>Since</b> gathering <b>them</b> requires <b>even greater exertion, he renounces</b> his <b>ownership</b> of <b>them.</b>

### Part 17
If one <b><i>kav</i> of dates</b> was scattered with a dispersal ratio of one <i>kav</i> <b>in</b> an area of <b>four</b> by four <b>cubits,</b> or if one <b><i>kav</i> of pomegranates</b> was scattered with a dispersal ratio of one <i>kav</i> <b>in</b> an area of <b>four</b> by four <b>cubits, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The aspects of the dilemma are: In the case of one <b><i>kav</i></b> of kernels scattered <b>in</b> an area of <b>four</b> by four <b>cubits, what is the reason</b> that the owner renounces ownership? It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that they are not</b> of <b>significant</b> value; <b>and also</b> in the case of one <b><i>kav</i> of dates in</b> an area of <b>four</b> by four <b>cubits or</b> one <b><i>kav</i> of pomegranates in</b> an area of <b>four</b> by four <b>cubits, since they are not</b> of <b>significant</b> value <b>he renounces ownership</b> of the fruit.

### Part 18
<b>Or perhaps,</b> the owner renounces ownership in the case of one <b><i>kav</i></b> of <b>kernels</b> scattered <b>in</b> an area of <b>four</b> by four <b>cubits due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> gathering <b>them</b> requires <b>great exertion. And</b> in the case of one <b><i>kav</i> of dates in</b> an area of <b>four</b> by four <b>cubits or</b> one <b><i>kav</i> of pomegranates in</b> an area of <b>four</b> by four <b>cubits, since</b> gathering <b>them does not</b> require <b>great exertion</b> he does <b>not renounce</b> his <b>ownership</b> of <b>them.</b> In all these cases, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara concludes: All these dilemmas <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
