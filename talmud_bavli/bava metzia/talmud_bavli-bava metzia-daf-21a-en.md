### Part 1
<b>as we ask the witnesses whether</b> the loan was <b>repaid</b> or <b>whether</b> it was <b>not repaid.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another challenge from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A <i>simpon</i> upon which witnesses</b> are signed is <b>valid.</b> Apparently, it is valid even if it is found in the possession of the creditor, as no distinction is made. The Gemara answers: To <b>what witnesses</b> is the <i>baraita</i> referring? It is referring to <b>witnesses of ratification.</b> The fact that the <i>simpon</i> was ratified by the court proves its validity.

### Part 3
The Gemara notes that <b>this too stands to reason, from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> in <b>the latter clause: And</b> a <i>simpon</i> <b>upon which witnesses</b> are <b>not</b> signed is <b>invalid. What</b> is meant by the expression: <b>Upon which witnesses</b> are <b>not</b> signed? <b>If we say</b> that it means <b>that there are no witnesses</b> signed <b>on it at all,</b> does it <b>need to be said that</b> it is <b>invalid? Rather, is it not</b> referring to a <i>simpon</i> on which witnesses are signed, just not <b>witnesses of ratification?</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>itself</b> cited above: <b>A <i>simpon</i> upon which witnesses</b> are signed <b>is ratified by</b> means of <b>its signatories.</b> If <b>there are no witnesses</b> signed <b>on it, but</b> the <i>simpon</i> <b>emerges from the possession of a third party</b> serving as a trustee, <b>or</b> if <b>it emerges after the signing of</b> the <b>documents,</b> i.e., the <i>simpon</i> was written on the promissory note beneath the content of the note and the witnessesâ€™ signatures, it is <b>valid.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara explains: The reason that it is valid if it <b>emerges from the possession of a third party</b> is <b>that</b> the <b>creditor granted credibility to</b> the <b>third party</b> by placing the <i>simpon</i> in his possession. <b>So too,</b> the <i>simpon</i> is valid in a case where <b>it emerges after the signing of</b> the <b>documents, as, if not</b> for the fact <b>that</b> the debt <b>was repaid,</b> the creditor <b>would not have undermined his note</b> by allowing the <i>simpon</i> to be written on it.
