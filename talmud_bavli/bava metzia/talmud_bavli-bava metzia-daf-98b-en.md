### Part 1
i.e., the <b>borrower</b> said to the owner: With regard to <b>one</b> of the cows that you claim, this <b>matter never occurred,</b> as I never took that cow from you. <b>And</b> as for the cows that I did take that died, with regard to <b>one</b> of them, <b>yes,</b> I admit that it was a cow <b>that</b> was being <b>borrowed</b> that <b>died; but the other</b> cow that died, <b>I do not know whether</b> it was the cow that was being <b>rented</b> that <b>died, and</b> so the cow <b>that is</b> still <b>alive</b> is the one <b>that</b> was being <b>borrowed, or</b> whether the cow <b>that</b> was being <b>borrowed died, and</b> so the cow <b>that is</b> still <b>alive is</b> the one <b>that</b> was being <b>rented.</b> Because the bailee admits to part of the claim and denies another part of the claim, he is required to take an oath in order to be exempt from the rest of the claim. As he concedes that he does not know what happened, he is unable to take such an oath. The <i>halakha</i> is that <b>since he is unable to take an oath, he must pay</b> for all three cows.

### Part 2
§ The mishna teaches: The bailee rented one cow and borrowed another one. <b>This</b> owner <b>says</b> with certitude: The <b>borrowed</b> cow is the one that died. <b>And that</b> renter <b>says</b> with certitude: The <b>rented</b> cow is the one that died. In this case, <b>the renter takes an oath that the rented</b> cow is the one that <b>died</b> and then he is exempt.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>But why</b> should he take an oath? <b>That which</b> the owner <b>claimed from him, he did not admit to</b> at all, <b>and that which</b> the bailee <b>admitted to,</b> the owner <b>had not claimed from him.</b> In order to be required to take an oath, the bailee must admit to part of the owner’s actual claim. <b>Ulla said:</b> The mishna is referring to a case where the owner required the bailee to take another oath <b>by extending</b> the oath that he had already required him to take.

### Part 4
The Gemara elaborates: For example, this is a case <b>where</b> the owner <b>said to him: Take an oath to me, in any event, that</b> the cow <b>died naturally,</b> and not as a result of your negligence. The owner has a right to demand such an oath. <b>And since</b> the bailee <b>is made to take an oath that</b> the cow <b>died naturally,</b> that oath can be extended such that <b>he</b> can <b>also be made to take an oath that</b> it was the cow that was <b>rented</b> that <b>died.</b>

### Part 5
The mishna concludes: If <b>this</b> one <b>says: I do not know</b> what happened, <b>and that</b> one <b>says:</b> I do not know what happened, then they divide the disputed amount. The bailee is liable to pay for only half the value of the cow. The Gemara asks: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this?</b> It <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Sumakhos, who says:</b> When there is <b>property of uncertain ownership,</b> the parties <b>divide</b> it equally between them.

### Part 6
§ <b>Rabbi Abba bar Memel raises a dilemma:</b> If one <b>borrowed</b> a cow together <b>with</b> borrowing the services of its <b>owner,</b> and then, before returning the cow, <b>he rented</b> the cow from the owner <b>without</b> borrowing the services of its <b>owner, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?

### Part 7
<b>Do we say:</b> The <b>borrowing stands by itself and</b> the <b>renting stands by itself,</b> i.e., they are two independent transactions, and so the bailee is liable for any mishap that occurs during the renting period, as the owner’s services were not borrowed by him during that time? <b>Or, perhaps</b> the subsequent <b>renting is related to</b> the prior <b>borrowing</b> and is an extension of it. It could be said that the renting is related to the borrowing <b>because</b> a renter is <b>liable for theft and loss,</b> as is a borrower. Perhaps the liability resulting from renting that immediately follows a period of borrowing is a downgraded form of the liability undertaken at the start of the period of borrowing. If so, then in this case, since the bailee bore no liability during the borrowing period, as the cow was borrowed while the owner was providing his services to the borrower, the bailee will not bear liability during the rental period.

### Part 8
<b>If you say</b> that in such a case, the subsequent <b>renting is related to</b> the prior <b>borrowing</b> and is an extension of it, then in the reverse case, where <b>one rented</b> a cow together <b>with</b> borrowing the services of its <b>owner,</b> and then, before returning the cow, <b>he borrowed it</b> from the owner <b>without</b> borrowing the services of its <b>owner, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?

### Part 9
Do we say that the subsequent <b>borrowing is certainly not related to</b> or an extension of the prior <b>renting,</b> as a borrower undertakes a higher level of liability than a renter? <b>Or perhaps, since</b> the subsequent borrowing is <b>partially related</b> to the prior renting, as the borrower is liable for theft and loss just as a renter is, <b>it is considered as though it were related entirely to it</b> and is an extension of it. Consequently, the exemption of using an item together with its owner’s services also applies to the subsequent borrowing.

### Part 10
<b>If you say:</b> In such a case, <b>we do not say that since</b> the subsequent borrowing is <b>partially related</b> to the prior renting, <b>it is considered as though it were entirely related to it</b> and is an extension of it, then in a case where <b>one borrowed</b> a cow together <b>with</b> borrowing the services of its <b>owner, and</b> then, before returning the cow, <b>he rented it</b> from the owner <b>without</b> borrowing the services of its <b>owner, and then</b> at the end of the renting period, <b>he</b> again <b>borrowed it</b> without the owner’s services, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?

### Part 11
Do we say that the second period of <b>borrowing returns to its</b> original <b>place,</b> i.e., is the third period, in which one borrowed the cow, essentially a continuation of the first period? <b>Or, perhaps,</b> the period of <b>renting</b> serves as <b>an interruption in the middle</b> of the two periods of borrowing, such that the third period cannot be seen as a continuation of the first period?

### Part 12
Similarly, in another case, <b>one rented</b> a cow together <b>with</b> borrowing the services of its <b>owner. And</b> then, before returning the cow, <b>he borrowed it</b> from the owner without borrowing the services of its owner. <b>And then,</b> at the end of the borrowing period, <b>he</b> again <b>rented it,</b> without borrowing the services of the owner. <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say</b> that the second period of <b>renting returns</b> it <b>to its</b> original <b>place,</b> i.e., is the second period essentially a continuation of the first period? <b>Or, perhaps</b> the period of <b>borrowing</b> serves as <b>an interruption in the middle</b> of the two periods of renting, such that the third period cannot be seen as a continuation of the first period.

### Part 13
The Gemara concludes: These dilemmas <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 14
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who borrowed a cow, and</b> the lender <b>sent it to</b> the borrower <b>by the hand of</b> his <b>son,</b> or <b>by the hand of his slave,</b> or <b>by the hand of his agent, or by the hand of</b> the borrower’s <b>son,</b> or <b>by the hand of his slave,</b> or <b>by the hand of</b> the <b>agent of</b> the <b>borrower; and it died</b> on the way, the borrower <b>is exempt,</b> because the period of borrowing begins only once the cow reaches his domain.

### Part 15
<b>The borrower said to</b> the lender: <b>Send it to me by the hand of my son,</b> or <b>by the hand of my slave,</b> or <b>by the hand of my agent, or by the hand of your son,</b> or <b>by the hand of your slave,</b> or <b>by the hand of your agent. Or,</b> in a case <b>where the lender said</b> explicitly <b>to</b> the borrower: <b>I am sending it to you by the hand of my son,</b> or <b>by the hand of my slave,</b> or <b>by the hand of my agent, or by the hand of your son,</b> or <b>by the hand of your slave,</b> or <b>by the hand of your agent; and the borrower said to him: Send</b> it as you have said, <b>and he</b> then <b>sent it, and it died</b> on the way, then the borrower <b>is liable</b> to pay the lender the value of his cow. Since the borrower agreed to the cow’s being brought to him by the hand of another, he bears liability from the moment the cow was transferred into that person’s possession.

### Part 16
<b>And, so too,</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>at</b> the <b>time when</b> the borrower <b>returns it</b> to the lender. The borrower is absolved of liability only once the cow is transferred to the lender himself or to someone who the lender agreed will bring it to him.
