### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who deposited coins with another,</b> and that bailee <b>bound it</b> in a cloth <b>and slung it behind him,</b> or <b>conveyed them to his minor son or daughter</b> for safeguarding, <b>or locked</b> the door <b>before them in an inappropriate,</b> i.e., insufficient, manner to secure them, the bailee is <b>liable</b> to pay for the coins, <b>as he did not safeguard</b> the coins <b>in the manner</b> typical <b>of bailees. But if he safeguarded</b> the money <b>in the manner</b> that <b>bailees</b> safeguard items and it was nevertheless stolen, he is <b>exempt.</b>

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Granted,</b> for <b>all</b> the other cases, the bailee is liable to pay, <b>as he did not safeguard</b> the money <b>in the manner</b> that <b>bailees</b> safeguard items. <b>But</b> if the bailee <b>bound it</b> in a cloth <b>and slung it behind him, what</b> more <b>was he to do? Rava says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: The verse states: “And you shall bind up the money in your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:25), from which it is derived: <b>Although it is bound,</b> in order to safeguard the money, <b>it</b> must <b>be in your hand.</b>

### Part 3
<b>And</b> apropos that verse, <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: A person’s money should always be found in his possession.</b> He should not invest all of his money, leaving him with no money available for expenditures, <b>as it is stated: “And you shall bind up the money in your hand.” And Rabbi Yitzḥak says: A person should always divide his money into three;</b> he should bury <b>one-third in the ground, and</b> invest <b>one-third in business [<i>bifrakmatya</i>], and</b> keep <b>one-third in his possession.</b>

### Part 4
<b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak says: Blessing is found only in a matter concealed from the eye, as it is stated: “The Lord will command blessing with you in your storehouses”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:8), where the grain is concealed. <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Blessing is found only in a matter</b> over <b>which the eye has no dominion, as it is stated: “The Lord will command blessing with you in your storehouses.”</b>

### Part 5
<b>The Sages taught: One who goes to measure</b> the grain on <b>his threshing floor recites: May it be Your will, O Lord, our God, that You send blessing upon the product of our hands.</b> If <b>one began to measure</b> the grain <b>he says: Blessed is He Who sends blessing upon this pile</b> of grain. If <b>one measured and afterward recited</b> this blessing, <b>this is a prayer</b> made <b>in vain, because blessing is found neither in a matter that is weighed, nor in a matter that is measured, nor in a matter that is counted. Rather,</b> it is found <b>in a matter concealed from the eye, as it is stated: “The Lord will command blessing with you in your storehouses.”</b>

### Part 6
§ <b>Shmuel says:</b> There is <b>safeguarding</b> for <b>money only in the ground. Rava said: And Shmuel concedes</b> if one received a deposit <b>on Shabbat eve at twilight, that the Rabbis did not impose upon him</b> to bury it in the ground immediately. <b>And if, at the conclusion of Shabbat, he delayed and did not bury</b> the money within the <b>period</b> of time needed <b>to bury it, he is liable</b> to pay the owner if it is stolen. <b>And if</b> the one who deposited the money <b>is a Torah scholar</b> and the bailee <b>thought: Perhaps he requires money for <i>havdala</i>,</b> and that is the reason that he did not bury the money immediately, then he may delay burying the money a bit longer.

### Part 7
The Gemara comments: <b>And now that rummagers,</b> who dig to find and steal buried property, <b>are commonplace,</b> there is <b>safeguarding</b> for money <b>only in the beams of the roof</b> of a house. The Gemara comments: <b>And now that dismantlers,</b> who attempt to find and steal property hidden in beams, <b>are commonplace,</b> there is <b>safeguarding</b> for money <b>only between the bricks</b> of a wall. <b>Rava said: And Shmuel concedes</b> that money can be safeguarded <b>in the wall or, alternatively, between the corners</b> of the house. <b>And now that tappers,</b> who tap on walls to find and steal property hidden there, <b>are commonplace,</b> there is <b>safeguarding</b> for money <b>only in the handbreadth</b> of the wall <b>adjacent to the ground or in the handbreadth</b> of the wall <b>adjacent to the ceiling,</b> as tapping on the wall will not reveal their existence.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Yosef, said to Rav Ashi: We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 31b): The legal status of <b>leavened bread upon which a rockslide fell is like</b> that of leavened bread that was <b>eliminated,</b> as it will remain there forever. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> This ruling applies in <b>any</b> case where the leavened bread is covered to the extent <b>that a dog is unable to detect it. And</b> it is <b>taught: How much is the</b> measure of <b>detection of a dog?</b> It is <b>three handbreadths.</b> The question is: <b>Here, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we require</b> the money to be buried at a depth of <b>three handbreadths or not?</b>

### Part 9
Rav Ashi <b>said to</b> Rav Aḥa: <b>There,</b> with regard to bread, it is <b>due to the scent</b> that <b>we require three handbreadths</b> to obscure it from the dog. <b>Here,</b> with regard to money, it is <b>because</b> it must be <b>obscured from the eye</b> that we bury it. Scent is not relevant, and therefore <b>we do not need three handbreadths.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And how</b> deep must the money be buried? <b>Rafram from Sikhera said:</b> One <b>handbreadth.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain man who deposited money with another,</b> and the bailee <b>placed it in a willow hut</b> from which the money <b>was stolen. Rav Yosef said: Although with regard to thieves,</b> placing the money in the hut <b>is</b> effective <b>safeguarding, with regard to fire it is negligence,</b> as it is likely to burn. Therefore, it is a case where the incident was <b>initially through negligence and ultimately by accident,</b> and the bailee is <b>liable</b> to pay. <b>And some say: Although with regard to fire it is negligence, with regard to thieves it is</b> effective <b>safeguarding.</b> Therefore, it is a case where the <b>beginning of</b> the incident was <b>negligence and ultimately</b> the damage was caused <b>by accident,</b> and the bailee is <b>exempt.</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is: In a case where the incident was <b>initially through negligence and ultimately by accident,</b> the bailee is <b>liable</b> to pay.

### Part 11
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain man who deposited money with another.</b> Eventually, the owner of the money <b>said to</b> the bailee: <b>Give me my money.</b> The bailee <b>said to him: I do not know where I placed it.</b> The matter <b>came before Rava,</b> who <b>said to</b> the bailee: <b>Every</b> circumstance where a bailee claims: <b>I do not know, is</b> in and of itself <b>negligence; go pay.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain man who deposited money with another.</b> The bailee <b>gave</b> the money <b>to his mother, and</b> she <b>placed</b> the money <b>in a chest [<i>bekartalita</i>], and it was stolen. Rava said: How should judges rule in this case?</b>

### Part 13
<b>Let us say to</b> the bailee: <b>Go pay.</b> But he can <b>say:</b> There is a principle:
