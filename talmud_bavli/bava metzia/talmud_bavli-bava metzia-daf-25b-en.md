### Part 1
If they were configured <b>like the stones of the house</b> of worship dedicated to the Roman deity <b>Mercury, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?

### Part 2
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution of the dilemma. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>found scattered coins, these belong to him.</b> If they were configured <b>like the stones of the house</b> of worship dedicated to <b>Mercury,</b> he is <b>obligated to proclaim</b> his find. The Gemara explains: <b>And these are</b> coins that were configured <b>like the stones of the house</b> of worship dedicated to <b>Mercury: One</b> was situated <b>here</b> on one side, <b>and one</b> was situated <b>there</b> alongside it, <b>and one</b> was situated <b>atop</b> the two of <b>them.</b>

### Part 3
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who finds a <i>sela</i></b> coin <b>in the marketplace and another</b> person <b>finds him and says: It is mine,</b> and the distinguishing mark is that <b>it is new,</b> or that it <b>is</b> a coin minted <b>by</b> the emperor <b>Nero,</b> or that it is minted <b>by king so-and-so, he has not said anything</b> and the finder need not give him the <i>sela</i>. <b>Moreover, even</b> if <b>his name is written on</b> the <i>sela</i> <b>he has not said anything, due to</b> the fact <b>that there is no distinguishing mark for a coin</b> that is effective in its recovery, <b>as</b> the finder <b>says: Perhaps he spent</b> the coin <b>and it fell from another person.</b>

### Part 4
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one <b>found, behind</b> a wooden <b>fence or behind</b> a stone <b>fence, bound fledglings, or</b> if he found them <b>in the paths that</b> run <b>through fields, he may not touch them,</b> as they were certainly placed there intentionally. In a case where <b>one found a vessel in a garbage dump, if</b> it is <b>concealed, he may not touch it,</b> as a person certainly concealed it there. <b>If</b> it is <b>exposed,</b> the finder <b>takes</b> the item <b>and proclaims</b> his find.

### Part 5
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What is the reason</b> that one may not touch the fledglings? The Gemara answers: The reason is <b>that we say</b> with regard to <b>these</b> birds: <b>A person concealed them, and if one takes them, their owner has no distinguishing mark on them</b> that would enable him to reclaim them. <b>Therefore, let</b> the finder <b>leave</b> the birds in place <b>until their owner comes and takes them.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>But why? Let</b> the <b>knot</b> binding them serve as their <b>distinguishing mark. Rabbi Abba bar Zavda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> This is a case <b>where</b> the birds were <b>bound at their wings. Since everyone binds them</b> in <b>that</b> manner, the knot binding the birds is not a distinguishing mark.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>And let</b> their <b>location</b> serve as their <b>distinguishing mark. Rav Ukva bar Ḥama said:</b> This is a case <b>where</b> the birds <b>hop</b> and do not remain in place. The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> it is a case <b>where</b> the birds <b>hop,</b> perhaps the birds <b>came</b> to that location <b>from elsewhere and</b> it <b>is permitted</b> for the finder to keep them.

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: <b>It can be said that</b> the birds <b>came from elsewhere and it can be said</b> that <b>a person concealed them, and</b> the result <b>is uncertainty</b> with regard to whether the <b>placement</b> of the birds was deliberate, i.e., whether or not they are lost items. <b>And Rabbi Abba bar Zavda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> In <b>any</b> case of <b>uncertainty</b> as to whether the <b>placement</b> of an item was deliberate, one <b>may not take</b> it <b><i>ab initio</i>. And if he took</b> it, he need <b>not return</b> it.

### Part 9
§ The mishna teaches: In a case where <b>one found a vessel in a garbage dump, if</b> it is <b>concealed, he may not touch it,</b> as a person certainly concealed it there. <b>If</b> it is <b>exposed,</b> the finder <b>takes</b> the item <b>and proclaims</b> his find. The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>found a vessel concealed in a garbage dump,</b> the finder <b>takes</b> the item <b>and proclaims</b> his find, <b>because</b> it is <b>routine</b> for <b>a garbage dump to be cleared.</b> Therefore, presumably it was not placed there; rather, it is a lost item and one is obligated to proclaim his find.

### Part 10
<b>Rav Zevid said</b> that this is <b>not difficult: This</b> mishna is referring <b>to containers or cups. That</b> <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to knives or a fork [<i>vehamnik</i>].</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>In</b> the case of <b>containers or cups,</b> which are large, it is inconceivable that they fell there inadvertently, so <b>he may not touch</b> them. <b>In</b> the case of <b>knives or forks,</b> which are small, there is room for uncertainty as to whether it was placed there or whether it fell, so the finder <b>takes</b> the item <b>and proclaims</b> his find.

### Part 11
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> Both <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> mishna are referring <b>to containers and cups, and</b> nevertheless, it is <b>not difficult: Here,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to a garbage dump that is designed to be cleared;</b> therefore, he must take the vessel and proclaim his find to prevent it from being cleared with the garbage. <b>There,</b> the mishna is referring <b>to a garbage dump that is not designed to be cleared;</b> as it is possible that the owner placed it there, the finder may not touch it.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: How could one be obligated to proclaim his find of a vessel in a <b>garbage dump that is designed to be cleared?</b> Even if the owner of the vessel concealed it there, it is <b>a deliberate loss</b> and the owner renounced ownership of the vessel. The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>a garbage dump that is not designed to be cleared, and</b> the owner of the land <b>reconsidered</b> and decided <b>to clear it.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to Rav Pappa, this</b> is the reason <b>that the</b> <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: He takes it and proclaims his find, <b>because</b> it is <b>routine</b> for <b>a garbage dump to be cleared,</b> as the ruling is dependent on whether the dump is ultimately cleared. <b>But according to Rav Zevid,</b> the reason for the ruling in the <i>baraita</i> is that the utensils found were knives and forks. <b>What</b> is the relevance of the statement in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Because</b> it is <b>routine</b> for <b>a garbage dump to be cleared?</b> The Gemara answers that according to Rav Zevid, it means: <b>Because</b> it is <b>routine</b> for <b>a garbage dump to</b> inadvertently have <b>small utensils cleared,</b> i.e., discarded, <b>into it.</b>

### Part 14
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one <b>found</b> lost items <b>in a heap</b> of stone rubble <b>or in an old wall, these</b> belong <b>to him.</b> If <b>one found</b> lost items <b>in a new wall from its midpoint and outward,</b> they belong <b>to him.</b> If he found the items <b>from its midpoint and inward,</b> they belong <b>to the homeowner. If</b> the homeowner <b>would rent</b> the house <b>to others</b> on a regular basis and there was a steady turnover of residents, <b>even</b> if one found lost items <b>inside the house, these</b> belong <b>to him.</b> Since the owner of the lost items cannot be identified based on location, he will certainly despair of recovering his lost items.

### Part 15
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that if one found a lost item in a heap of rubble or in an old wall it belongs to him. The Sages <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is his <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> when the owner of the heap or wall claims the property, the finder <b>can say to him: They</b> belong <b>to the Amorites,</b> who lived in Eretz Yisrael before it was conquered by the Jews. The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>Amorites conceal</b> items but <b>Jews do not conceal</b> items? Perhaps it was the homeowner who placed the item in the wall or the heap. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is necessary</b> only in the specific case
