### Part 1
in this case, since the purchaser already <b>died,</b> the owner is not present to call the seller a robber, so he presumably did not intend to retroactively validate the sale. <b>And</b> conversely, according to <b>the one who says</b> that he bought the land because <b>it is preferable for him to maintain his reliability, it is preferable for him to maintain his reliability with regard to</b> the purchaser’s <b>children too.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara challenges this distinction: <b>Ultimately, the purchaser’s children</b> will also <b>call</b> the seller <b>a robber</b> if the field is appropriated from them. Therefore, there is no difference between the two explanations of Rav’s ruling in a case where the purchaser has died.

### Part 3
<b>Rather,</b> the practical difference <b>between them is</b> in a case <b>where</b> the <b>robber</b> himself <b>died,</b> and his children subsequently bought the field from its owner. According to <b>the one who says</b> that the motivation is that <b>it is preferable for a person not to be called a robber, he</b> already <b>died</b> and this motive is not applicable. While <b>according to the one who says</b> that his motivation is that <b>it is preferable for him to maintain his reliability,</b> in this case <b>also, even though</b> the robber <b>died,</b> it is still <b>preferable for him to maintain his reliability,</b> i.e., one is concerned about the reputation he will have after his death, not only while he is alive.

### Part 4
The Gemara rejects this distinction as well: <b>Ultimately,</b> if the sale is revoked after his death, people will <b>call his children the children of a robber.</b> Just as one does not want to be called a robber during his lifetime, one presumably does not want his children to be called the children of a robber after his death.

### Part 5
<b>Rather,</b> the practical difference <b>between them is</b> in a case <b>where</b> the robber <b>gave</b> the land to the recipient <b>as a gift</b> rather than selling it. According to <b>the one who says</b> that <b>it is preferable for him to maintain his reliability,</b> in the case of <b>a gift also, it is preferable for him to maintain his reliability.</b> While according to <b>the one who says</b> that the motivation is that <b>it is preferable for him not to be called a robber,</b> in this case the robber could <b>say to</b> the recipient of the gift: <b>What did I rob you of?</b> You incurred no loss.

### Part 6
§ The Gemara discusses various scenarios relating to the <i>halakha</i> of one who sold stolen land and then acquired it from the robbery victim. It is <b>obvious</b> that if, after selling the stolen land, the robber <b>sold it</b> again to another person, or <b>bequeathed it, or gave it as a gift,</b> it is clear that the robber <b>does not want to establish it before,</b> i.e., transfer ownership of it to, the original <b>buyer.</b> Therefore, the robber’s purchase of the land from the robbery victim is not assumed to be for the purpose of validating the original sale. The buyer can demand compensation from the robber for the invalid sale, but the land remains in the possession of the second buyer or the recipient of the gift or the inheritance.

### Part 7
Likewise, it is clear that if the land that he stole and then sold later <b>came into his</b> possession not by purchase but <b>as an inheritance,</b> the buyer does not have the rights to it, as <b>an inheritance is</b> acquired <b>passively, and</b> the robber <b>did not make an effort to</b> acquire <b>it.</b> Here too, the buyer can claim only compensation and not the land itself.

### Part 8
If the robber <b>collected</b> the land that he had sold as payment <b>for a debt</b> owed <b>to him</b> by the robbery victim, <b>we</b> need to <b>see</b> the circumstances. <b>If</b> the robbery victim <b>has other land</b> from which the robber could have collected the debt, <b>and</b> nevertheless the robber <b>said: I want</b> to collect <b>this</b> land, apparently the robber <b>wanted to establish it before</b> the <b>buyer</b> and validate the sale.

### Part 9
<b>And if</b> the robbery victim does <b>not</b> have other land, and the robber had no choice as to which land to collect, there is no reason to assume that the robber was attempting to validate the sale. <b>He</b> merely <b>wanted to be paid money</b> for his debt, and not to secure the land for the buyer.

### Part 10
With regard to a case where the robbery victim <b>gave</b> the land <b>as a gift to</b> the robber, <b>Rav Aḥa and Ravina disagree. One says</b> that <b>a gift</b> has the same status <b>as an inheritance, as</b> it is also acquired <b>passively, and one says</b> that <b>a gift</b> has the same status <b>as a sale.</b> This is <b>because were it not</b> for the fact <b>that</b> the robber <b>took the trouble to ingratiate himself with</b> the owner, <b>he would not have given</b> it <b>to him</b> as <b>a gift.</b> It is clearly <b>for this</b> reason that the robber <b>took the trouble to ingratiate himself with him,</b> i.e., <b>in order to</b> validate the sale and thereby <b>maintain his reliability.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>And until when</b> can it be assumed that the robber bought the land because <b>it is preferable for him to maintain his reliability? Rav Huna says: Until the time of standing trial.</b> Once the purchaser takes the robber to court, it is too late for the robber to protect his reputation, as the purchaser has demonstrated that he does not consider the robber to be trustworthy.

### Part 12
<b>Ḥiyya bar Rav says</b> that the robber would still buy the land from the owner in order to maintain his reliability up <b>until</b> the time that a document of <b>authorization</b> by the court to locate and seize property from the robber <b>comes into</b> the purchaser’s <b>possession.</b> It is only once the robber avoids immediately reimbursing the purchaser and the court is compelled to authorize the purchaser to appropriate the robber’s property that the robber’s reliability is no longer a factor. <b>Rav Pappa says</b> that the robber’s reliability remains a motive to acquire the field <b>until the days of announcement begin.</b> During the days of announcement the court assesses the value of the robber’s property in order to compensate the purchaser.

### Part 13
§ <b>Rami bar Ḥama objects to</b> Rav’s statement, the focal point of this discussion, that the robber transfers to the buyer any rights to the land that he might acquire; <b>after all, by</b> means of <b>what</b> mode of acquisition <b>does this purchaser acquire this land?</b> It is <b>by</b> means of <b>this deed</b> of sale that the robber gave him. The purchase is invalid, as <b>this document is merely a shard,</b> since the robber did not own, at the time of the sale, the land he purported to sell.

### Part 14
<b>Rava said to him</b> in response: <b>Let</b> Rav’s statement be understood as applying <b>to</b> a case where the buyer said to the robber that <b>he trusts him</b> to resolve the legal issue. <b>By</b> virtue of <b>that satisfaction that</b> the robber received from the buyer’s <b>not having said anything to him</b> to question his rights to the land, <b>but</b> rather having <b>relied on him,</b> the robber therefore <b>takes the trouble and brings to him</b> the opportunity to purchase the land and <b>resolves to transfer</b> the land’s <b>ownership to him.</b>

### Part 15
<b>Rav Sheshet raises an objection</b> to Rav’s statement from a <i>baraita</i> that states that if one says: <b>That which I will inherit from my father is</b> hereby <b>sold to you,</b> or: <b>That which my net will catch is sold to you, he has said nothing, as</b> one cannot sell that which he does not yet own. But if one says: <b>That which I will inherit from my father today is</b> hereby <b>sold to you,</b> or: <b>That which my net will catch today is sold to you, his statement stands.</b> The first <i>halakha</i> of the <i>baraita</i> indicates that one cannot sell that which he does not yet own, which contradicts Rav’s ruling.

### Part 16
<b>Rami bar Ḥama said</b> about this objection: <b>This is the</b> great <b>man and this is his refutation</b> of Rav’s opinion; i.e., this refutation is compelling.

### Part 17
<b>Rava said</b> in response: <b>I see</b> that he is a great <b>man, but I do not see the conclusive refutation. Here,</b> in the case of validating a sale, the purchaser <b>relies</b> on the seller and is confident he will acquire the land; <b>but there,</b> in the case of the <i>baraita</i>, the purchaser <b>does not</b> fully <b>rely</b> on the seller. The Gemara explains: <b>Here,</b> in the case of validating the sale, the purchaser <b>relies</b> on the seller <b>to go take the trouble and provide him</b> with the land <b>so that he will not be called a robber.</b> Whereas <b>there,</b> in the case of the <i>baraita</i>, the purchaser <b>does not</b> fully <b>rely</b> on the seller, as it is uncertain whether the seller will actually inherit his father’s property or catch anything with his net.

### Part 18
The Gemara relates that the Sages <b>sent</b> Rav Sheshet’s objection and presented <b>it before Rabbi Abba bar Zavda</b> for his evaluation. Rabbi Abba bar Zavda <b>said to them: This</b> objection <b>need not</b> be introduced <b>inside</b> the study hall for further clarification, as it is clear and compelling. <b>Rava</b> disagreed and <b>said: This</b> objection <b>needs</b> to be brought <b>inside</b> the study hall <b>and inside the innermost</b> area of the study hall. In other words, it should be examined carefully, as it is not compelling. This is because <b>here,</b> the purchaser <b>relies</b> on the seller, whereas <b>there,</b> in the case of the <i>baraita</i>, the purchaser <b>does not</b> fully <b>rely</b> on the seller.

### Part 19
<b>There was an incident in Pumbedita</b> where the court ruled in accordance with the opinion of Rav, <b>and</b> the Sages <b>refuted</b> the ruling based on the <i>baraita</i> cited earlier. <b>Rav Yosef said to them: This</b> objection <b>need not</b> be introduced <b>inside</b> the study hall for further clarification, as the objection is clear and compelling. <b>And Abaye said to him:</b> It <b>needs</b> to be brought <b>inside</b> the study hall <b>and inside the innermost</b> area of the study hall, as <b>here</b> the purchaser <b>relies</b> on the seller, whereas <b>there</b> the purchaser <b>does not</b> fully <b>rely</b> on the seller.

### Part 20
The Gemara asks concerning the <i>baraita</i> cited earlier: <b>And what is different</b> in <b>the first clause,</b> where the sale is not valid, <b>and what is different</b> in <b>the latter clause,</b> where the sale is valid? In both cases, the seller does not yet own the merchandise. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> In <b>the latter clause,</b> when the seller states: I am selling <b>that which I will inherit from my father today,</b> he does so <b>for the honor of his father.</b> He believes that his father will die that day, and his intention is to raise money for the burial. Consequently, the Sages instituted an ordinance that the sale is valid. Similarly, in the case of a person who says: <b>That which my net will catch today</b> is sold to you,
