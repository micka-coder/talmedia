that <b>he redeems it at four dinars</b> a year, despite the fact that the produce is worth more? <b>Here too,</b> it <b>is no different.</b> Since he established the deduction of a fixed sum that he cannot be sure he will receive, the practice is permitted, even if he in fact profits from the arrangement.

### Part 2
<b>And the one who prohibits</b> this arrangement could have <b>said to you</b> that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>an ancestral field is</b> discussing <b>consecrated property and the Merciful One established redemption for it,</b> on the basis of which the Sages determined the full redemption. <b>Here,</b> by contrast, it is <b>a loan, and</b> therefore it <b>has the appearance of interest.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rav Ashi said: The elders of</b> the town of <b>Mata Meḥasya told me: An unspecified mortgage [<i>mashkanta</i>]</b> is for <b>a year.</b> The Gemara poses a question: <b>What is the</b> practical <b>difference</b> resulting from this ruling? The Gemara explains: It means <b>that if</b> the lender <b>consumed its</b> produce for <b>a year,</b> the borrower <b>can</b> then <b>remove him; but if not,</b> the borrower <b>cannot</b> yet <b>remove him,</b> as an unspecified mortgage does not last less than this period of time.

### Part 4
<b>And Rav Ashi said: The elders of Mata Meḥasya told me: What</b> is the meaning of the word <b><i>mashkanta</i>?</b> It is referring to the fact <b>that it resides [<i>shekhuna</i>] with him.</b> The Gemara again asks: <b>What is the</b> practical <b>difference</b> resulting from his statement? The Gemara answers: It is relevant <b>for the <i>halakha</i> of one</b> whose field <b>borders</b> the field of his neighbor. Since the mortgaged field resides with him, it is considered his property to a certain extent, and therefore he is granted the right to purchase a neighboring field before an outside party does so.

### Part 5
<b>Rava said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> those who approve of <b>the tacit interest</b> agreement <b>of Rav Pappa, nor in accordance with</b> those who approve of <b>the documents of Meḥoza, nor in accordance with</b> those who approve of <b>the tenancies of Neresh.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara clarifies these statements: The <i>halakha</i> is not <b>in accordance with</b> those who approve of <b>the tacit interest</b> agreement <b>of Rav Pappa;</b> this is referring <b>to the tacit interest</b> agreement <b>of Rav Pappa</b> (65a). Rav Pappa would sell liquor and accept delayed payment at a higher price, and believed this to be permitted since he did not gain anything from the arrangement.

### Part 7
What are <b>the documents of Meḥoza?</b> In Meḥoza <b>they would</b> lend money to someone for him to use in a joint business venture, and <b>add the profits to the principal,</b> as though the transaction were already completed, <b>and they would write</b> the full sum owed, including the lender’s share of the profits, <b>in the document.</b> The reason it is prohibited to do this is that <b>who says there will be</b> any <b>profit?</b> It is possible that the borrower will suffer a loss or earn less than expected, and he will eventually be paying interest if he pays the full amount recorded in the document.

### Part 8
<b>Mar, son of Ameimar, said to Rav Ashi: Father would do so,</b> i.e., he would add the profits to the sum of the loan contract, <b>and when they came before him</b> and told him they had not earned enough profit <b>he would believe them</b> and reduce the debt to the amount they had actually earned. Rav Ashi <b>said to him:</b> This <b>works out well while</b> the lender <b>is</b> still <b>here,</b> but <b>if he dies and the document comes before the orphans, what</b> would happen in that case? Unaware that profits have been added to the document, the orphans would demand the entire sum, which would constitute interest. The Gemara comments: This innocent observation of Rav Ashi’s <b>was “like an error that proceeds from a ruler”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:5), <b>and Ameimar died</b> shortly afterward.

### Part 9
The Gemara addresses the final ruling. What are <b>the tenancies of Neresh?</b> In the town of Neresh <b>they would write</b> a document <b>in this</b> manner: <b>So-and-so has mortgaged his land to so-and-so, and</b> the borrower then <b>went and leased it back from him</b> for a fee that was added to the payment of the loan. This transaction is problematic. <b>When did</b> the lender <b>acquire it,</b> such that he can subsequently <b>transfer it</b> back <b>to</b> the borrower? As he is not the actual owner of the field, the money for the lease is actually payment for the delay in repaying the loan, and therefore this arrangement is considered interest.

### Part 10
The Gemara comments: <b>And nowadays, when we write</b> a document <b>in this</b> manner: <b>We acquired</b> the property <b>from him and we waited a while and</b> then the borrower <b>went and leased it back</b> for such and such a price, a formula that states that the lender has acquired the field and may now lease it to others, which is utilized <b>so as not to lock the door in the face of</b> potential <b>borrowers,</b> it is <b>permitted,</b> as it does not have the appearance of a loan with interest. The Gemara concludes: <b>But this is not correct,</b> as even if the field is in his possession, since he has not acquired it properly, it is considered interest.

### Part 11
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may not establish</b> a deal with <b>a storekeeper for half the profits.</b> It is prohibited for one to provide a storekeeper with produce for him to sell in his store, with half the profits going to the lender. In such an arrangement, the storekeeper himself is responsible for half of any loss from the venture, effectively rendering half of the produce as a loan to the storekeeper. The lender remains responsible for the other half of any loss, and the storekeeper provides a service by selling his produce for him. This service, if provided free of charge, is viewed as interest paid for the loan, and is prohibited. <b>And</b> similarly, <b>one may not give</b> a storekeeper <b>money with which to acquire produce</b> for the storekeeper to sell <b>for half the profits.</b> These activities are both prohibited <b>unless</b> the owner <b>gives</b> the storekeeper <b>his wages as</b> a salaried <b>laborer</b> hired to sell the produce, after which they can divide the remaining profits.

### Part 12
<b>One may not</b> give eggs to another to <b>place chickens</b> on them in exchange <b>for half</b> the profits, <b>and one may not appraise calves or foals</b> for another to raise them <b>for half</b> the profits. These activities are both prohibited <b>unless</b> the owner <b>gives</b> the other <b>wages for his toil and</b> the cost of the <b>food</b> he gives to the animals in his temporary care. All this applies when the lender establishes a fixed minimum profit he insists on receiving regardless of what happens to the animals.

### Part 13
<b>But one may accept calves or foals</b> to raise as a joint venture <b>for half</b> of the earnings, with one side providing the animals and taking full responsibility for losses, and the other providing the work and the sustenance, <b>and</b> the one raising them <b>may raise them until they reach one-third</b> of their maturation, at which point they are sold and the profits shared. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>a donkey,</b> it can be raised in this manner <b>until it is</b> large enough <b>to bear a load.</b>

### Part 14
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Sages <b>taught:</b> When the mishna states that the owner must pay the manager of the venture as a salaried laborer, it means he must pay him <b>as an idle laborer.</b> The Gemara poses a question: <b>What</b> does it mean to pay someone <b>as an idle laborer?</b>
