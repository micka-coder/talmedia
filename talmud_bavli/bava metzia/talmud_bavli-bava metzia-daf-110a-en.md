such trees <b>are sold as wood and land is acquired with them, and</b> her husband <b>consumes the produce,</b> while the land itself belongs to the wife. The Gemara answers that the text should be emended to <b>say: And they grew old,</b> meaning that the trees were not old when she inherited them but they aged with the passage of time.

### Part 2
<b>And if you wish, say: Did we not</b> already <b>establish that</b> mishna as referring to a case <b>where</b> the vines or olive trees <b>were bequeathed to her in a different field</b> that did not belong to her? Since in <b>that</b> case she inherited only the trees but not the land itself, they are considered the principal. Consequently, the husband taking all of it <b>would consume the principal</b> entirely. Therefore, they must be sold as wood, with the proceeds used for the purchase of land.

### Part 3
§ The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> mortgage <b>document in which it was written</b> that the land was granted to the creditor for <b>an unspecified</b> number of <b>years.</b> The <b>creditor said</b> it was for <b>three</b> years, whereas <b>the debtor said</b> it was for <b>two</b> years. While the issue was being adjudicated, the <b>creditor arose and consumed the produce</b> of the field in the third year. <b>Which</b> of them is <b>deemed credible</b> and accepted? <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> is that <b>land remains in its owner’s possession.</b> Therefore, the debtor has the presumptive right to the land, while the creditor, who owns the document, must provide proof for his claim. <b>Rav Kahana said:</b> The <b>produce remains in the possession of</b> the one who <b>consumed it,</b> and therefore the creditor’s claim is accepted.

### Part 4
The Gemara states: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Kahana, who said</b> that the <b>produce remains in the possession of</b> the one who <b>consumed it.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But don’t we maintain that the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Naḥman, who said</b> with regard to uncertainty concerning a rental during the extra month of a leap year that <b>land remains in its owner’s possession,</b> and he has the rights to that month? These two rulings appear to contradict each other.

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: <b>There it is a matter that will not be revealed</b> because it is impossible to clarify the uncertainty concerning whether the extra month is included. By contrast, <b>here it is a matter that will be revealed,</b> as the witnesses who signed the document may eventually reveal what it stated, <b>and we do not trouble the court</b> to convene <b>twice.</b> Therefore, the produce should remain in the possession of the one who consumed it until the matter is resolved.

### Part 6
The Gemara analyzes another case involving mortgaged land. The <b>creditor says</b> the mortgage was for <b>five</b> years while the <b>debtor</b> who owned the land <b>says</b> it was for <b>three.</b> The debtor <b>said to</b> the creditor: <b>Give me your document</b> so that we can see what is written there. The creditor <b>said to him: I lost the document. Rav Yehuda said:</b> The <b>creditor is deemed credible</b> and accepted in this case <b>since he could have made a more advantageous claim [<i>miggo</i>].</b> As the mortgage document is missing and even according to the claim of the debtor he could be in control of the land for the three years required for presumptive ownership, <b>if</b> he <b>wants</b> to lie he could <b>say:</b> The land was <b>purchased by me.</b> Since he did not submit this superior claim, his claim should be accepted.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Pappa said to Rav Ashi: Rav Zevid and Rav Avira do not hold</b> of <b>this</b> opinion <b>of Rav Yehuda. What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Since this document stands</b> ready <b>for collecting</b> the debt, the creditor would certainly have been <b>careful with regard to it.</b> Since he wants to ensure his money is returned it is unlikely he actually lost it. Rather, <b>he is</b> merely <b>hiding his document,</b> as he <b>thinks: I will consume</b> the produce of the field for <b>two extra years.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara analyzes Rav Yehuda’s opinion. <b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: If that is so,</b> that Rav Yehuda is correct, then with regard to <b>this mortgage according to</b> the custom practiced in <b>Sura,</b> a city in Babylonia, in <b>which they write this: Upon the completion of these years</b> of the mortgage <b>this land shall leave</b> the creditor’s possession and return to its owner <b>without</b> the debtor paying any <b>money</b> (see 67b), in a case <b>where</b> the creditor <b>hid the mortgage document and said</b> that the land was <b>purchased by me, so too</b> is it possible <b>that he is deemed credible? Would the Sages institute a matter that</b> might <b>cause a loss?</b> Rav Ashi <b>said to him: There,</b> in the mortgage of Sura, <b>the Sages instituted for</b> the landowner, i.e., the debtor, <b>that the landowner,</b> i.e., the debtor, <b>pays the</b> land <b>taxes and digs the trenches</b> for the irrigation of the field. In this manner, his ownership is preserved and established.

### Part 9
Ravina asks further: With regard to <b>land that has no</b> need for <b>trenches and</b> for which he <b>does not pay taxes, what</b> could he have done? Rav Ashi <b>said to him: He should have protested</b> before the three years needed for presumptive status had passed by announcing that the land was his. Ravina again inquires: If he <b>did not protest, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Rav Ashi replied: In that case, <b>he caused his own loss</b> by failing to take the necessary precautions.

### Part 10
§ The Gemara discusses another case. If <b>a sharecropper says: I descended</b> to the field <b>for half</b> the produce, as this was the agreement that we made, <b>and the homeowner says: I sent him down for</b> only <b>one-third</b> of the produce, <b>who is deemed credible</b> and his claim consequently accepted? <b>Rav Yehuda says: The homeowner is deemed credible</b> and his claim is consequently accepted, while <b>Rav Naḥman says: All</b> matters are <b>in accordance with the regional custom.</b> As the terms of their agreement are unknown, this sharecropper should have the same status as other sharecroppers in that location.

### Part 11
They <b>understood from</b> the above discussion that these two Sages <b>do not disagree,</b> but were referring to different cases: <b>This</b> one, Rav Naḥman, stated his ruling <b>with regard to a location where the sharecropper takes half,</b> in which case the sharecropper is believed, while <b>that</b> one, Rav Yehuda, stated his ruling <b>with regard to a location where the sharecropper takes one-third,</b> in which case the homeowner is believed.

### Part 12
<b>Rav Mari, son of the daughter of Shmuel, said to them: This</b> is what <b>Abaye said:</b> They <b>even disagree with regard to a location where the sharecropper</b> usually <b>takes half.</b> In that case, <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that here too <b>the homeowner is deemed credible</b> and his claim is consequently accepted, <b>as if he wants</b> to lie he could <b>say:</b> The other is not a sharecropper at all but merely <b>my hired worker,</b> who received a stipulated wage, <b>or my gleaner,</b> who performs occasional work for me but has no prearranged share of the crop at all.

### Part 13
The Gemara addresses another issue: If a field was on lien for a loan and the debtor died, and <b>the orphans</b> who inherited the field <b>say: We enhanced</b> the land after we inherited it, and therefore the creditor does not have a right to the value of that enhancement, <b>and the creditor says: Your father enhanced it,</b> and I am entitled to the land as it is, <b>upon whom</b> does the burden <b>to bring proof</b> fall?
