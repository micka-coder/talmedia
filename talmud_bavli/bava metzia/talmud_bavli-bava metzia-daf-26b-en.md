### Part 1
<b>that fell from</b> one of <b>two</b> people, he is <b>obligated to return</b> it. <b>What is the reason? The</b> person <b>from whom</b> the <i>sela</i> <b>fell does not despair</b> of recovering it. <b>He says: After all, no other person was with me, only this</b> one who was with me, as he is unaware that the <i>sela</i> was found by a third party. He therefore thinks: <b>I will seize him and say to him:</b> It <b>is you who took it.</b>

### Part 2
<b>In</b> a case where the coin fell from one of <b>three</b> people, the finder <b>is not obligated to return</b> it. <b>What is the reason? The</b> person <b>from whom</b> the <i>sela</i> <b>fell certainly despairs</b> of recovering it. <b>He says: After all, two</b> other people <b>were with me. If I seize this</b> one, he will <b>say: I did not take it. And if I seize that</b> one, he will <b>say: I did not take it.</b> Since he cannot make an definitive claim, he despairs of recovering his coin.

### Part 3
Based on the fact that by Torah law, one must return a lost item to its owner only if it is worth one <i>peruta</i>, <b>Rava said:</b> With regard to <b>that which you said,</b> that <b>in</b> a case where the coin fell from one of <b>three</b> people the finder <b>is not obligated to return</b> it, <b>we said</b> this <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the total value of the lost coin, when divided by three, <b>does not</b> amount to the <b>value of one <i>peruta</i> for each and every one</b> of them; <b>but</b> if it amounts to the <b>value of one <i>peruta</i> for each and every one</b> of them, he is <b>obligated to return</b> it. <b>What is the reason? Say</b> that perhaps <b>they are partners,</b> i.e., they own the coin jointly; consequently, <b>they do not despair,</b> as each assumes that one of the other two found it and is holding it for the three of them.

### Part 4
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>Rava said: Even if its</b> total <b>value is only two <i>perutot</i>,</b> which is insufficient to provide each of the three partners with one <i>peruta</i>, one is <b>obligated to return</b> it. <b>What is the reason? Say</b> that perhaps <b>they are partners and one relinquishes his share to another.</b> In that case, the remaining two partners each have a one <i>peruta</i> share, rendering the finder liable to return it.

### Part 5
§ <b>And Rava says:</b> In a case where <b>one saw a <i>sela</i></b> coin <b>that fell</b> from another, if <b>he took</b> the coin <b>in order to steal it, before</b> the <b>despair</b> of the owner, <b>he violates all of</b> the following mitzvot: He is liable <b>due to</b> the prohibition: <b>“You shall not…rob”</b> (Leviticus 19:13); <b>and due to</b> the positive mitzva, stated with regard to found items, of: <b>“You shall return</b> them to your brother” (Deuteronomy 22:1), <b>and due to</b> the prohibition, stated with regard to one who finds an item: <b>“You may not disregard”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:3). <b>And even if he returned it after</b> the <b>despair</b> of the owner, it is merely <b>a gift that he gave him; and the transgression that he performed, he performed,</b> and he remains in violation of these mitzvot.

### Part 6
Rava continues: If <b>he took</b> the coin <b>in order to return it, before</b> the <b>despair</b> of the owner, <b>and</b> then, <b>after</b> the <b>despair</b> of the owner, <b>he intended to steal it; he violates</b> a commandment, due to his failure to fulfill the positive mitzva of: <b>“You shall return</b> them to your brother.” He does not violate the prohibition: “You shall not…rob,” because at the time he took the coin he did not intend to keep it. And he does not violate the prohibition: “You may not disregard,” because he did not disregard the lost item. He took it with the intention of returning it.

### Part 7
If <b>he waited until the owner despaired</b> of recovering the lost item <b>and</b> only then <b>took it, he violates</b> a commandment, but <b>only</b> due to his failure to fulfill the positive mitzva of: <b>“You may not disregard,”</b> as he took no action to return the lost item to its owner.

### Part 8
<b>Rava says:</b> In the case of <b>this</b> person <b>who saw that a dinar</b> coin <b>fell from another into the sand, and</b> then he <b>found it and took it,</b> he <b>is not obligated to return it to</b> its owner. <b>What is the reason?</b> The reason is that <b>the one from whom the money fell despairs</b> of finding it. <b>Even if</b> the finder <b>sees that</b> the owner <b>brought a sifter and is sifting</b> through the sand, ostensibly indicating that he did not despair of finding his coin, perhaps the owner <b>is saying: Just as</b> a coin <b>fell from me</b> in the sand, <b>so too,</b> a coin <b>fell from another person and I will find some item</b> to offset my loss.

### Part 9
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one <b>found</b> items without a distinguishing mark <b>in a store, those</b> items belong <b>to him,</b> as, since the store is frequented by the multitudes, the owner despairs of its recovery. If the items were found <b>between the</b> storekeeper’s <b>counter and the storekeeper,</b> the items belong <b>to the storekeeper;</b> since his customers do not typically have access to that area, presumably the items are his. If one found coins <b>before a money changer, those</b> coins belong <b>to him.</b> If the coins were found <b>between the</b> money changer’s <b>chair and the money changer, those</b> coins belong <b>to the money changer,</b> because his clients do not typically have access to that area.

### Part 10
In the case of <b>one who purchases produce from another or</b> in a case <b>where another sent him produce</b> as a gift, <b>and he found coins</b> intermingled <b>with</b> the produce, <b>those</b> coins belong to <b>him. If</b> the coins <b>were bundled,</b> this serves as a distinguishing mark and the finder <b>takes</b> the coins <b>and proclaims</b> his find.

### Part 11
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that if one found coins before a money changer, those coins belong to him. <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Even</b> if the coins were found <b>placed upon</b> the <b>table</b> itself they belong to the finder.

### Part 12
The Gemara challenges: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: If one found coins <b>before a money changer, those</b> coins <b>belong to him;</b> this indicates by inference <b>that</b> if they were found <b>upon the table,</b> the coins belong <b>to the money changer.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>Say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: If the coins were found <b>between the</b> money changer’s <b>chair and the money changer, those</b> coins belong <b>to the money changer;</b> this indicates by inference <b>that</b> if they were found <b>upon the table,</b> the coins belong <b>to</b> the finder. The Gemara concludes: <b>Rather,</b> due to the contradictory inferences from the first and the latter clauses, <b>no</b> inference is <b>to be learned from this</b> mishna.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Elazar</b> himself, <b>from where</b> does he derive <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> that coins found on the table belong to the finder, given that apparently one cannot infer this ruling from the mishna? <b>Rava said: The mishna is difficult</b> for <b>him: Why</b> did the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach specifically</b> that when the coins are found <b>between the</b> money changer’s <b>chair and the money changer,</b> those coins belong <b>to the money changer? Let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach</b> instead: If the coins were found <b>on</b> the <b>table, or:</b> If the coins were found <b>in the money-changing establishment, as</b> it <b>is taught</b> in <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna: If one <b>found</b> items without a distinguishing mark <b>in a store,</b> those items belong <b>to him. Rather, learn from it</b> that since the money changer typically places his money in his drawer, <b>even</b> if the coins were found <b>placed upon</b> the <b>table</b> itself <b>these</b> coins belong <b>to him.</b>

### Part 14
§ The mishna teaches: In the case of <b>one who purchases produce from another,</b> and he found coins intermingled with the produce, those coins belong to him. <b>Reish Lakish says in the name of Rabbi Yannai:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> this <b>only</b>
