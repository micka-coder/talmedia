### Part 1
<b>Elijah</b> the prophet <b>encountered him</b>

### Part 2
and <b>said to him: Until when</b> will <b>you inform on the nation of our God</b> to be sentenced <b>to execution?</b> Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, <b>said to</b> Elijah: <b>What should I do? It is the king’s edict</b> that I must obey. Elijah <b>said to him:</b> Faced with this choice, <b>your father fled to Asia. You</b> should <b>flee to Laodicea</b> rather than accept this appointment.

### Part 3
§ With regard to these Sages, the Gemara adds: <b>When Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, would meet each other,</b> it was possible for <b>a pair of oxen to enter</b> and fit <b>between them,</b> under their bellies, <b>without touching them,</b> due to their excessive obesity.

### Part 4
<b>A certain</b> Roman <b>noblewoman [<i>matronita</i>]</b> once <b>said to them: Your children are not</b> really <b>your own,</b> as due to your obesity it is impossible that you engaged in intercourse with your wives. <b>They said to her: Theirs,</b> i.e., our wives’ bellies, <b>are larger than ours.</b> She said to them: <b>All the more so</b> you could not have had intercourse. <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>this is what they said to her: “For as the man is, so is his strength”</b> (Judges 8:21), i.e., our sexual organs are proportionate to our bellies. <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>this is what they said to her: Love compresses the flesh.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>And why did they respond to her</b> audacious and foolish question? After all, <b>it is written: “Answer not a fool according to his folly,</b> lest you also be like him” (Proverbs 26:4). The Gemara answers: They answered her <b>in order not to cast aspersions on</b> the lineage of <b>their children.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara continues discussing the bodies of these Sages: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The <b>organ of Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei,</b> was the size <b>of a jug of nine <i>kav</i>. Rav Pappa said:</b> The <b>organ of Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> was the size <b>of a jug of five <i>kav</i>, and some say</b> it was the size of a jug <b>of three <i>kav</i>. Rav Pappa himself</b> had a belly <b>like the baskets [<i>dikurei</i>]</b> made <b>in Harpanya.</b>

### Part 7
With regard to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s physical features, the Gemara adds that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: I</b> alone <b>remain of the beautiful</b> people <b>of Jerusalem.</b> The Gemara continues: <b>One who wishes to see</b> something resembling <b>the beauty of Rabbi Yoḥanan should bring</b> a new, shiny <b>silver goblet from the smithy and fill it</b> with <b>red pomegranate seeds [<i>partzidaya</i>] and place a diadem of red roses upon</b> the <b>lip</b> of the goblet, <b>and position it between the sunlight and shade. That luster</b> is <b>a semblance of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s beauty.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so?</b> Was Rabbi Yoḥanan so beautiful? <b>But doesn’t the Master say: The beauty of Rav Kahana</b> is <b>a semblance of the beauty of Rabbi Abbahu; the beauty of Rabbi Abbahu</b> is <b>a semblance of the beauty of Jacob, our forefather;</b> and <b>the beauty of Jacob, our forefather,</b> is <b>a semblance of the beauty of Adam the first</b> man, who was created in the image of God. <b>And yet Rabbi Yoḥanan is not included</b> in this list. The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> is <b>different</b> from these other men, <b>as he did not have a beauty of countenance,</b> i.e., he did not have a beard.

### Part 9
The Gemara continues to discuss Rabbi Yoḥanan’s beauty. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan would go and sit by the entrance to the ritual bath. He said</b> to himself: <b>When Jewish women come up from</b> their <b>immersion</b> for the sake <b>of a mitzva,</b> after their menstruation, <b>they should encounter me</b> first, <b>so that they have beautiful children like me,</b> and sons <b>learned in Torah like me.</b> This is based on the idea that the image upon which a woman meditates during intercourse affects the child she conceives.

### Part 10
<b>The Rabbis said to</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>Isn’t the Master worried about</b> being harmed by <b>the evil eye</b> by displaying yourself in this manner? Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to them: I come from the offspring of Joseph, over whom the evil eye does not have dominion, as it is written: “Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine by a fountain [<i>alei ayin</i>]”</b> (Genesis 49:22); <b>and Rabbi Abbahu says: Do not read</b> the verse as saying: <b>“By a fountain [<i>alei ayin</i>]”; rather,</b> read it as: <b>Those who rise above</b> the evil <b>eye [<i>olei ayin</i>].</b> Joseph’s descendants are not susceptible to the influence of the evil eye.

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said</b> that this idea is derived <b>from here: “And let them grow [<i>veyidgu</i>] into a multitude in the midst of the earth”</b> (Genesis 48:16). <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>fish [<i>dagim</i>] in the sea, the water covers them and the</b> evil <b>eye</b> therefore <b>has no dominion over them,</b> as they are not seen, <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>the offspring of Joseph, the</b> evil <b>eye has no dominion over them.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara relates: <b>One day, Rabbi Yoḥanan was bathing in the Jordan</b> River. <b>Reish Lakish saw him and jumped into the Jordan, pursuing him.</b> At that time, Reish Lakish was the leader of a band of marauders. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to</b> Reish Lakish: <b>Your strength</b> is fit <b>for Torah</b> study. Reish Lakish <b>said to him: Your beauty</b> is fit <b>for women.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: If you return</b> to the pursuit of Torah, <b>I will give you my sister</b> in marriage, <b>who is more beautiful than I am.</b> Reish Lakish <b>accepted upon himself</b> to study Torah. Subsequently, Reish Lakish <b>wanted to jump back</b> out of the river <b>to bring</b> back <b>his clothes, but he was unable to return,</b> as he had lost his physical strength as soon as he accepted the responsibility to study Torah upon himself.

### Part 13
Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>taught</b> Reish Lakish <b>Bible, and taught him Mishna, and turned him into a great man.</b> Eventually, Reish Lakish became one of the outstanding Torah scholars of his generation. <b>One day</b> the Sages <b>of the study hall were engaging in a dispute</b> concerning the following <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>the sword, the knife, the dagger [<i>vehapigyon</i>], the spear, a hand sickle, and a harvest sickle, from when are they susceptible to ritual impurity?</b> The <i>baraita</i> answers: It is <b>from the time of the completion of their manufacture,</b> which is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to metal vessels in general.

### Part 14
These Sages inquired: <b>And when is the completion of their manufacture? Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It is <b>from when one fires</b> these items <b>in the furnace. Reish Lakish said:</b> It is <b>from when one scours them in water,</b> after they have been fired in the furnace. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to</b> Reish Lakish: <b>A bandit knows about his banditry,</b> i.e., you are an expert in weaponry because you were a bandit in your youth. Reish Lakish <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>What benefit did you provide me</b> by bringing me close to Torah? <b>There,</b> among the bandits, <b>they called me: Leader</b> of the bandits, and <b>here,</b> too, <b>they call me: Leader</b> of the bandits. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: I provided benefit to you, as I brought you close</b> to God, <b>under the wings of the Divine Presence.</b>

### Part 15
As a result of the quarrel, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan was offended,</b> which in turn affected <b>Reish Lakish,</b> who <b>fell ill.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan’s <b>sister,</b> who was Reish Lakish’s wife, <b>came crying</b> to Rabbi Yoḥanan, begging that he pray for Reish Lakish’s recovery. <b>She said to him: Do</b> this <b>for the sake of my children,</b> so that they should have a father. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to her</b> the verse: <b>“Leave your fatherless children, I will rear them”</b> (Jeremiah 49:11), i.e., I will take care of them. She said to him: <b>Do</b> so <b>for the sake of my widowhood. He said to her</b> the rest of the verse: <b>“And let your widows trust in Me.”</b>

### Part 16
Ultimately, <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish,</b> Reish Lakish, <b>died. Rabbi Yoḥanan was sorely pained over</b> losing <b>him. The Rabbis said: Who will go to calm</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan’s <b>mind</b> and comfort him over his loss? They said: <b>Let Rabbi Elazar ben Pedat go, as his statements are sharp,</b> i.e., he is clever and will be able to serve as a substitute for Reish Lakish.

### Part 17
Rabbi Elazar ben Pedat <b>went and sat before</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan. With regard to <b>every matter that Rabbi Yoḥanan would say,</b> Rabbi Elazar ben Pedat would <b>say to him:</b> There is a ruling which <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>that supports your</b> opinion. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said</b> to him: <b>Are you</b> comparable <b>to the son of Lakish?</b> In my discussions with <b>the son of Lakish, when I would state a matter, he would raise twenty-four difficulties against me</b> in an attempt to disprove my claim, <b>and I would answer him with twenty-four answers, and the <i>halakha</i> by itself would become broadened</b> and clarified. <b>And</b> yet <b>you say</b> to me: There is a ruling which <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>that supports your</b> opinion. <b>Do I not know that what I say is good?</b> Being rebutted by Reish Lakish served a purpose; your bringing proof to my statements does not.

### Part 18
Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>went around, rending his clothing, weeping and saying: Where are you, son of Lakish? Where are you, son of Lakish?</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>screamed until his mind was taken from him,</b> i.e., he went insane. <b>The Rabbis</b> prayed and <b>requested</b> for God to have <b>mercy on him</b> and take his soul, <b>and</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>died.</b>
