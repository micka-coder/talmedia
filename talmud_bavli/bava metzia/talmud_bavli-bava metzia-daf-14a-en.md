### Part 1
The Gemara answers: <b>It is</b> actually <b>one</b> element, <b>as</b> both elements have the same <b>one reason; because Rabbi Elazar says that</b> the <b>dispute</b> in the mishna is <b>in</b> a case <b>when</b> the <b>liable party does not admit</b> his debt, <b>he explains</b> Rabbi Meir’s opinion <b>in this manner,</b> i.e., that a promissory note that does not include a property guarantee cannot be used to collect the debt even from unsold property.

### Part 2
The Gemara elaborates on the statement that the <i>baraita</i> serves as <b>a conclusive refutation of two</b> elements <b>of</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel: One</b> element is <b>like</b> the element of the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar</b> that was refuted, <b>as</b> Shmuel also <b>establishes</b> the dispute in <b>the mishna</b> as referring <b>to</b> a case <b>when</b> the <b>liable party does not admit</b> to the debt, and the <i>baraita</i> states that in such a case there is no dispute.

### Part 3
<b>And</b> the other <b>one</b> is <b>that</b> which <b>Shmuel says:</b> If one <b>found a deed of transfer in the marketplace,</b> in which it is stipulated that the debtor transfers the rights to his property from the date that the document was signed, <b>he must return</b> it <b>to</b> its <b>owner, and we do not suspect</b> that there was <b>repayment</b> and that there is collusion between the creditor and the debtor.

### Part 4
There is <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of that statement as well, <b>as</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>here teaches: Even if they both agree, he should return</b> it <b>neither to this</b> person <b>nor to that</b> person. <b>Apparently, we suspect</b> that there was <b>repayment. And all the more so here,</b> in the case of a deed of transfer, <b>when the liable party does not admit</b> that he owes money, the deed should certainly not be returned, <b>as we suspect</b> that there was <b>repayment.</b>

### Part 5
§ <b>Shmuel said: What is the reason for</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who say that one can collect a debt from liened property even if the promissory note does not include a property guarantee? <b>They hold</b> that omission of the property <b>guarantee</b> from the promissory note <b>is a scribal error,</b> as one would certainly not lend money without a property guarantee.

### Part 6
<b>Rava bar Ittai said to Rav Idi bar Avin: Did Shmuel</b> actually <b>say this;</b> i.e., that the omission of this clause is considered a scribal error? <b>But doesn’t Shmuel say</b> that <b>enhancement, superior-quality land, and a lien require consultation?</b> When a scribe writes a deed of sale for a field he must ask the seller whether to write explicitly that if there is a lien on the field, and the field is then is repossessed from the buyer, in which case the seller must compensate the buyer for any enhancement of the value of the field that occurred while it was in his possession, that this compensation will be made from superior-quality land, and that he liens all of his land as security for this sale. This indicates that Shmuel holds that a property guarantee is not written in every promissory note.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>the one who says this</b> statement quoting Shmuel <b>does not say that</b> statement quoting Shmuel? Perhaps it is a dispute between the <i>amora’im</i> who transmitted the statements of Shmuel.

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> where Shmuel said that the omission of a property guarantee is a scribal error, it was <b>with regard to a promissory note, as a person does not give</b> away <b>his money for nothing.</b> When one lends his money, he requires a property guarantee. <b>There,</b> by contrast, where Shmuel said that a scribe must consult with the seller with regard to writing a property guarantee, it is <b>with regard to</b> a case of <b>buying and selling</b> land, <b>as a person is apt to purchase land for a day.</b> It is conceivable that the buyer is willing to risk that there is a prior lien on the land, thinking that even if he owns the property only for one day he can earn a profit.

### Part 9
As evidence of this distinction, the Gemara gives an example: It is <b>like that</b> incident in <b>which Avuh bar Ihi purchased a loft from his sister.</b> Her <b>creditor came and repossessed</b> the loft <b>from him. He came before Mar Shmuel</b> to file a claim against his sister. Shmuel <b>said to him: Did she write you a guarantee</b> in the deed of sale? <b>He said to</b> Shmuel: <b>No.</b> Shmuel <b>said to</b> him: <b>If so, go to peace</b> (see <i>Berakhot</i> 64a), as there is nothing that can be done. He <b>said to</b> Shmuel: <b>But wasn’t it</b> you, <b>Master, who said</b> that omission of the <b>guarantee</b> of the sale from the document <b>is a scribal error?</b> Shmuel <b>said to him: This statement</b> applies only <b>to promissory notes, but with regard to deeds of buying and selling</b> it does <b>not</b> apply, <b>as a person is apt to purchase land for a day.</b>

### Part 10
§ <b>Abaye said:</b> Consider the case of <b>Reuven, who sold a field to Shimon with</b> a property <b>guarantee, and Reuven’s creditor came and repossessed</b> the field <b>from</b> Shimon, as he had a prior lien on the property. <b>It is the <i>halakha</i> that Reuven can go and litigate with</b> the creditor, <b>and</b> the creditor <b>cannot say to him: I am not legally answerable to you</b> since I am taking the field from Shimon. This is <b>because</b> Reuven can <b>say to</b> his creditor: That <b>which you take from him comes back to me,</b> as I sold the field to Shimon with a guarantee, so you cannot claim that I am not a legal party in this matter.

### Part 11
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that Abaye said: <b>Even</b> if Reuven sold the field to Shimon <b>without</b> a property <b>guarantee,</b> Reuven can dispute the legal claim in court, <b>as he can say to</b> the creditor: <b>It is not amenable to me that Shimon would have a grievance against me</b> for selling him property that was subsequently repossessed.

### Part 12
<b>And Abaye said:</b> Consider the case of <b>Reuven, who sold a field to Shimon without</b> a property <b>guarantee, and disputants emerged</b> disputing Reuven’s prior ownership of the field. <b>As long as</b> Shimon <b>has not</b> yet <b>taken</b> actual <b>possession</b> of the land,
