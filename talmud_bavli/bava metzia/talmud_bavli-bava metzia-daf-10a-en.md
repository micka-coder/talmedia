### Part 1
<b>whose</b> opinion is expressed in <b>the mishna? It is</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who hold that one cannot acquire an item for another in this manner. <b>But if you say</b> that the <b>dispute</b> is specifically <b>in</b> a case of <b>a rich person and a poor person but</b> in a case where the <i>pe’a</i> was gleaned <b>by a poor person on behalf of a poor person everyone agrees</b> that <b>he acquired</b> it <b>on</b> the latter’s <b>behalf,</b> in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? It is <b>neither</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis nor</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer.</b>

### Part 2
Ulla <b>said to</b> Rav Naḥman: <b>The mishna</b> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the one lifting the item <b>said:</b> I intended to acquire the item for myself <b>at the outset;</b> I never had intention to acquire it on behalf of the rider.

### Part 3
The Gemara adds: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> to explain the mishna in this manner, <b>as it teaches in the last clause:</b> But <b>if, after giving it to</b> the one riding the animal <b>he said: I acquired it</b> for myself <b>at the outset, he has said nothing</b> and the rider keeps the item. <b>Why do I need</b> the phrase: <b>At the outset,</b> to be mentioned <b>in the last clause? It is obvious</b> that <b>even if he did not</b> explicitly <b>say: At the outset, he meant</b> that he acquired it <b>at the outset,</b> before he gave it to the rider. <b>Rather, isn’t</b> this phrase mentioned to <b>teach us this: The first clause</b> of the mishna is also referring a case <b>where he said:</b> I intended to acquire it for myself <b>at the outset?</b>

### Part 4
<b>And the other</b> Sage, Rav Naḥman, is of the opinion that the mishna <b>taught</b> this phrase in <b>the last clause</b> of the mishna in order <b>to shed light on the first clause. The last clause</b> is referring to a case <b>where he said</b> that he acquired the item <b>at the outset</b> in order to indicate that in <b>the first clause,</b> the one who lifts the item acquires it even in a case <b>where he did not say</b> that he acquired it for himself <b>at the outset.</b> In Rav Naḥman’s opinion, the rider does not acquire the item until it is given to him.

### Part 5
§ The Gemara discusses the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman and Rav Ḥisda, who both say:</b> In a case of <b>one who</b> performs an act of acquisition by <b>lifting a found item on behalf of another, the other</b> person, i.e., the latter, <b>does not acquire</b> ownership of the item.

### Part 6
<b>What is the reason</b> for this? The reason is that <b>it is</b> a case of <b>one who seizes</b> assets <b>for a creditor in a situation that</b> will result in <b>a disadvantage for others,</b> as the debtor owes money to other creditors as well; <b>and one who seizes</b> assets <b>for a creditor in a situation that</b> will result in <b>a disadvantage for others does not acquire</b> the assets for him. Although a creditor can himself seize the assets as payment for the debt, no one else can take action that will benefit one person at the expense of others. Similarly, since everyone has equal rights to an ownerless item that is found, one person cannot deprive all others of that right on behalf of another person.

### Part 7
<b>Rava raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The found item of a laborer,</b> i.e., something that he found, belongs <b>to him</b> and not to the employer for whom he is working at that time.

### Part 8
<b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that the item belongs to the laborer, <b>said?</b> It is said <b>when the employer</b> told the laborer to perform a specific task, e.g., he <b>said to him: Weed for me today,</b> or: <b>Till for me today.</b> Since the employer specified the task that he hired the laborer to perform, the laborer has rights to the item that the laborer found. <b>But</b> if the employer <b>said to</b> the laborer: <b>Work for me today,</b> without specifying the nature of the work, the <b>found item is the employer’s,</b> as finding ownerless items is included within the general category of work. This indicates that a laborer can acquire an item for someone else, which contradicts Rav Naḥman’s principle.

### Part 9
Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: A laborer is different, as his hand is like the hand of the employer.</b> He is considered his agent while he is working for him.

### Part 10
Rava responded: <b>But doesn’t Rav say</b> that <b>a laborer may reconsider</b> and quit his job, <b>even at midday?</b> Evidently, the relationship between the employer and the laborer is structured to the benefit of the laborer.

### Part 11
Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: As long as he does not retract</b> his commitment, his hand <b>is like the employer’s hand. When</b> he does <b>retract</b> his commitment, he <b>is</b> able to do so. But this is not because matters are structured to the benefit of the laborer, but for <b>a different reason, as it is written: “For to Me the children of Israel are slaves;</b> they are My slaves whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt” (Leviticus 25:55), which indicates: <b>They are My slaves, and not slaves of slaves,</b> i.e., of other Jews. Consequently, a Jew can never be enslaved to another Jew with a contract from which he cannot release himself whenever he wishes. Nevertheless, as long as the laborer does not quit the job, he is considered his employer’s agent.

### Part 12
Contrary to the opinion of Rav Naḥman and Rav Ḥisda, <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In a case of <b>one who</b> performs an act of acquisition by <b>lifting a found item on behalf of another, the other</b> person <b>acquires</b> ownership of the item. <b>And if you say</b> that <b>our mishna</b> seems to suggest otherwise, it is referring to a case <b>where</b> the rider <b>says</b> to the pedestrian: <b>Give</b> it <b>to me, but does not say: Acquire</b> it <b>for me.</b> If he says give it to me, the rider acquires the item only when it reaches his possession. If he says acquire it for me, the rider acquires the item as soon as the pedestrian lifts it.

### Part 13
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one <b>saw a found item and fell upon it,</b> intending to thereby acquire it, but did not employ one of the formal modes of acquisition, <b>and</b> then <b>another came and seized it, the one who seized it acquired it</b> because he employed one of the formal modes of acquisition.

### Part 14
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Reish Lakish says in the name of Abba Kohen Bardela:</b> The area of <b>four</b> square <b>cubits</b> surrounding <b>a person</b> has the legal status of his courtyard, and it <b>effects acquisition</b> of every ownerless item located there <b>for him, everywhere. What is the reason</b> for this? <b>The Sages instituted</b> this ordinance <b>so that</b> people <b>would not come to quarrel</b> over an item. <b>Abaye said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef raises an objection</b> to this from a mishna in tractate <b><i>Pe’a</i>. Rava said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi raises an objection</b> to this from a mishna in <b><i>Nezikin</i>.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara elaborates: <b>Abaye said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef raises an objection</b> to this from a mishna in tractate <b><i>Pe’a</i></b> (4:3), which states: If a poor person <b>took some of the <i>pe’a</i></b> in the field <b>and threw it on the rest</b> of the <i>pe’a</i> in order to acquire it, <b>he has nothing of it.</b> The same is true if <b>he fell upon</b> the <i>pe’a</i>, or if <b>he spread his garment over it;</b> others may <b>remove him</b> or his garment <b>from</b> the <i>pe’a</i> in order to take it for themselves, as he did not acquire it. <b>And the same</b> is true <b>in</b> the case of <b>a forgotten sheaf</b> left for the poor; a poor person cannot acquire it in any of these manners.

### Part 16
Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef continues: <b>And if you say</b> that <b>a person’s</b> area of <b>four</b> square <b>cubits effects acquisition</b> of property <b>for him everywhere, let his</b> area of <b>four</b> square <b>cubits effect acquisition</b> of the <i>pe’a</i> or the forgotten sheaf <b>for him.</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara responds: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where he did not say: I will acquire</b> the <i>pe’a</i> through this action. He performed the action without revealing his intention; therefore, his acquisition is ineffective.

### Part 18
The Gemara asks: <b>But if the Sages instituted</b> an ordinance that the area of four cubits surrounding a person acquires property for him, then even in a case <b>where he did not say:</b> I will acquire the produce, <b>what of it?</b> Shouldn’t he have acquired it even without expressing his intent to do so?

### Part 19
The Gemara answers: This case is different. <b>Since he fell</b> upon it <b>he</b> thereby <b>revealed his intention: That it is satisfactory for him to acquire</b> the produce <b>by falling</b> on it and <b>it is not satisfactory for him to acquire</b> the produce <b>through</b> the ordinance concerning his <b>four</b> square <b>cubits.</b> Since he decided to forgo the mode of acquisition that the Sages instituted, and falling on the produce is not a valid mode of acquisition, he did not acquire the produce.
