### Part 1
<b>I was worthy.</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, this is <b>difficult.</b>

### Part 2
§ It <b>is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i>: With regard to one who cultivates a field, <b>the first and second time he plants</b> the field again if the crops were destroyed by some mishap, <b>but the third</b> time <b>he is not</b> required to <b>plant it</b> again. <b>And</b> it <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that on the <b>third</b> occasion, he must <b>plant it</b> the field again, but after the <b>fourth</b> time the crops are destroyed, <b>he is not</b> required to <b>plant it</b> again. These two <i>baraitot</i> appear to contradict one another. The Gemara explains: That is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, whereas <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara clarifies: <b>This</b> <i>baraita</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>who says</b> that <b>presumptive status is</b> established <b>by two occasions,</b> while <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, who says</b> that <b>presumptive status is</b> established <b>by three occasions.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Reish Lakish said: They taught</b> that a cultivator plants a limited number of times <b>only if he planted</b> the field <b>and it sprouted and locusts consumed</b> the crops, <b>but</b> if <b>he planted it and</b> the crops <b>did not sprout</b> at all, <b>the landowner can say to him:</b> You should <b>continue planting it</b> on <b>all the days</b> that are fit for <b>planting.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And until when</b> does the period of planting last? The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Pappa said: Until</b> such time <b>that the sharecroppers come</b> in <b>from the field and</b> the stars of <b>Pleiades</b> are <b>stationed over their heads,</b> which occurs roughly during the month of <i>Shevat</i>.

### Part 5
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to this from a <i>baraita</i> that discusses the verse: “While the earth remains, planting and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease” (Genesis 8:22). The <i>baraita</i> interprets this verse as referring to six seasons of the year: <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says in the name of Rabbi Meir, and similarly, Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya would say in accordance with his statement:</b> The second <b>half of Tishrei,</b> all of <b>Marḥeshvan, and</b> the first <b>half of Kislev</b> are the days of <b>planting.</b>

### Part 6
The second <b>half of Kislev,</b> all of <b>Tevet, and</b> the first <b>half of Shevat</b> are <b>the winter</b> days. The second <b>half of Shevat,</b> all of <b>Adar, and</b> the first <b>half of</b> Nisan are the period of <b>cold;</b> the second <b>half of Nisan,</b> all of <b>Iyar, and</b> the first <b>half of Sivan</b> are the <b>harvest</b> period. The second <b>half of Sivan,</b> all of <b>Tammuz, and half of Av</b> are the <b>summer</b> season, while the second <b>half of Av,</b> all of <b>Elul, and</b> the first <b>half of Tishrei</b> are the season of <b>heat.</b>

### Part 7
The <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> also would divide the year into these six seasons, but he <b>counts from</b> the beginning of <b>Tishrei</b> rather than from the middle. <b>Rabbi Shimon counts from Marḥeshvan,</b> so that Marḥeshvan and Kislev constitute the season of planting, and so on.

### Part 8
The Gemara states its objection: <b>Who</b> is the most <b>lenient of all of them</b> in that the period of planting occurs at the latest time of the year? It is <b>Rabbi Shimon, and</b> even he <b>did not say</b> that the planting season extends <b>that far</b> to the time when Pleiades is above their heads. The Gemara responds: That is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> is referring to a cultivator <b>who accepted from</b> the owner the planting <b>of early</b> crops, while <b>that</b> case involves a cultivator <b>who accepted from</b> the owner the planting <b>of late</b> crops, performed at a much later date.

### Part 9
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: If</b> the cultivator <b>received it from</b> the owner <b>for</b> a fixed sum of <b>money,</b> whether a regional disaster occurred or not, he does not subtract the produce he owes as part of his tenancy. The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain man who received land to plant garlic on it on the bank of the river Malka Sava</b> in exchange <b>for</b> a specified sum of <b>money.</b> The bank of <b>the river Malka Sava became dammed up.</b> The case <b>came before Rava,</b> who <b>said to</b> the cultivator: <b>The river Malka Sava does not usually dam up.</b> Therefore, <b>it is</b> classified as <b>a regional disaster; go subtract</b> this loss from the payment you owe <b>to</b> the owner.

### Part 10
The Gemara continues the story: <b>The Rabbis said to Rava: Didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna here: <b>If</b> the cultivator <b>received it from</b> the owner <b>for</b> a fixed sum of <b>money, whether this</b> way or <b>whether that</b> way, i.e., whether a regional disaster occurred or not, <b>he does not subtract</b> the produce he owes as part of <b>his tenancy.</b> Rava <b>said to them: There is no</b> one <b>who is concerned for</b> the ruling <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> since it is a minority opinion that is rejected.

### Part 11
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who receives a field from another</b> to cultivate in return <b>for</b> the payment of <b>ten <i>kor</i> of wheat per year, and</b> its produce <b>was blighted</b> by a crop disease or the like, the cultivator <b>gives</b> the owner the ten <i>kor</i> of wheat <b>from it</b> but does not have to provide him with high quality wheat. If the wheat stalks produced by the field <b>were</b> particularly <b>good</b> stalks of <b>wheat,</b> the cultivator <b>may not say to</b> the owner: <b>I will buy</b> regular wheat <b>from the market; rather,</b> he <b>gives him from inside</b> the field itself.

### Part 12
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain man who received land to</b> grow <b>hay</b> in exchange <b>for</b> paying the owner several <b><i>kor</i> of barley.</b> After the field <b>produced hay,</b> the recipient <b>plowed and sowed it</b> with <b>barley, and that barley was blighted.</b> The worker sought to pay the owner from the damaged barley he had cultivated. <b>Rav Ḥaviva from Sura in the Euphrates sent</b> the following question <b>before Ravina: What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a case of this kind?</b> Is it <b>considered similar to</b> an instance of: If it <b>was blighted, he gives him from inside</b> the field, <b>or not?</b>

### Part 13
Ravina <b>said to him: Is it comparable? There,</b> in the mishna, <b>the land did not perform its owner’s mission,</b> and the cultivator also received blighted produce, whereas <b>here, the land did perform its owner’s mission,</b> as the cultivator took the land for the purpose of growing hay, which it produced. His additional crop of barley was not part of their agreement and therefore he cannot pay his debt with blighted barley.

### Part 14
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain man who received an orchard from another</b> to cultivate in exchange <b>for</b> paying the owner <b>ten barrels of wine,</b> but <b>that wine</b> produced from the orchard’s grapes <b>turned sour. Rav Kahana thought to say</b> that <b>this is</b> an example of the ruling of <b>the mishna</b> that if it <b>was blighted he</b> may <b>give him from inside</b> the field. <b>Rav Ashi said to him: Is it comparable? There,</b> in the mishna, <b>the land did not perform</b> its owner’s <b>mission,</b> as the crop was blighted, whereas <b>here, the land</b> did <b>perform</b> its owner’s <b>mission,</b> as there was nothing wrong with the grapes themselves, and the wine turned sour in the cultivator’s possession.

### Part 15
The Gemara comments: <b>And Rav Ashi concedes with regard to grapes that shrunk</b> over the course of their growth <b>and with regard to a field whose sheaves were blighted</b> that since the damage occurred to the crop itself, the cultivator can pay his debt from the produce of the field.

### Part 16
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who receives a field from another</b> in order <b>to plant it</b> with <b>barley,</b> he may <b>not plant it</b> with <b>wheat,</b> as wheat weakens the field more than barley does. But if he receives it in order to plant <b>wheat,</b> he may <b>plant it</b> with <b>barley</b> if he wishes, but <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel forbids</b> it. Similarly, if he receives it to plant <b>it with grain</b> he may <b>not plant it</b> with <b>legumes,</b> as they weaken the field more than grains do, but if he receives it in order to plant <b>legumes</b> he may <b>plant it</b> with <b>grain, but Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel forbids</b> it.

### Part 17
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Ḥisda said: What is the reason of</b> the ruling of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel?</b> The landowner has apparently suffered no loss from the cultivator’s actions. His reasoning is <b>as it is written: “The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies, neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth”</b> (Zephaniah 3:13). In other words, one may not retract from an obligation accepted upon oneself, even if no one suffers as a result.

### Part 18
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to this from a <i>baraita</i>: The <b>Purim collection is</b> only <b>for</b> the <b>Purim</b> feast, <b>but one does not scrutinize the matter</b> by limiting the allocation for the poor to the exact costs of the meal and no more. <b>And</b> it is <b>not permitted for a poor person to purchase</b> even <b>a strap for his sandal from it unless he stipulated in the presence of the people of the city</b> that he may do as he wishes with the money he receives. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Ya’akov, who said</b> it <b>in the name of Rabbi Meir. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</b>
