### Part 1
<b>And</b> he can lie <b>with regard to a host [<i>ushpiza</i>],</b> as one may say that he was not well received by a certain host to prevent everyone from taking advantage of the host’s hospitality. <b>What is the</b> practical <b>difference</b> that emerges from this statement with regard to matters in which Torah scholars deviate from the truth? <b>Mar Zutra says:</b> The practical difference is with regard <b>to returning a lost item on</b> the basis of <b>visual recognition. If we know about him that he alters</b> his statements <b>only with regard to these three</b> matters, <b>we return</b> the lost item <b>to him, but if he alters</b> his statements <b>with regard to other matters, we do not return</b> the lost item <b>to him.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara relates: <b>A silver goblet was stolen from the host of Mar Zutra Ḥasida.</b> Mar Zutra <b>saw a certain student</b> of Torah <b>who washed his hands and dried</b> them <b>on the cloak of another.</b> Mar Zutra <b>said: This is</b> the one <b>who does not care about the property of another. He bound</b> that student, <b>and</b> the student then <b>confessed</b> that he stole the goblet.

### Part 3
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Although <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar</b> holds that one does not need to proclaim his finding of <i>anpurya</i> vessels, he <b>concedes</b> that the finder is <b>obligated to proclaim</b> his find <b>of new vessels that the eye</b> of its purchaser has <b>sufficiently seen. And these are new vessels that the eye</b> of its purchaser has <b>not</b> yet <b>sufficiently seen</b> and concerning <b>which</b> the finder is <b>not obligated to proclaim</b> his find: <b>for example, branches [<i>badei</i>]</b> upon which <b>needles or utensils</b> for <b>spinning</b> are hanging, <b>or strings of axes. When is it permitted for</b> the one who finds <b>all those</b> items <b>that</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>mentioned</b> in the <i>baraita</i> to keep them? It is <b>when he found them one at a time. But</b> if <b>he found them two at a time,</b> the finder is <b>obligated to proclaim</b> his find.

### Part 4
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the term <b><i>badei</i>?</b> It means <b>branches. And why did</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>call them branches?</b> It is because the item <b>upon which one hangs</b> another <b>item [<i>davar detalu bei midei</i>], he calls it a branch, like that which we learned there</b> (<i>Sukka</i> 44b): <b>One leaf on one branch.</b>

### Part 5
§ The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And likewise, Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar would say:</b> In the case of <b>one who rescues</b> a lost item <b>from a lion, or from a bear, or from a cheetah [<i>bardelas</i>], or from the tide of the sea, or from the flooding of a river;</b> and in the case of <b>one who finds</b> a lost item <b>in a main thoroughfare [<i>seratya</i>] or a large plaza [<i>pelatya</i>], or in any place where the multitudes are found, these</b> items belong <b>to him due to</b> the fact <b>that the owner despairs of their</b> recovery.

### Part 6
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>When Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says</b> that if one finds a lost item in any place where multitudes are found, the item belongs to him, did he refer only to a place <b>where there is a majority of gentiles; but</b> in a place <b>where there is a majority of Jews,</b> the owner does <b>not</b> despair of recovering the item, because he relies on the Jews to return his item? <b>Or perhaps, even</b> in a place <b>where there is a majority of Jews, he also says</b> that the item belongs to the one who found it.

### Part 7
And <b>if you say</b> that <b>even</b> in a place <b>where there is a majority of Jews, he also said</b> that the item belongs to the one who found it, <b>do the Rabbis disagree with him or do they not disagree?</b>

### Part 8
<b>And if you say</b> that <b>the Rabbis disagree</b> with him, in a place <b>where there is a majority of Jews, they certainly disagree.</b> In a place <b>where there is a majority of gentiles, do</b> the Rabbis <b>disagree, or do they not disagree?</b>

### Part 9
<b>And if you say</b> that <b>the Rabbis disagree</b> with him <b>even</b> in a place <b>where there is a majority of gentiles,</b> is the <b><i>halakha</i> in accordance with</b> the opinion of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, <b>or</b> is the <b><i>halakha</i> not in accordance with his</b> opinion?

### Part 10
And <b>if you say</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, does this <i>halakha</i> apply <b>specifically</b> in a place <b>where there is a majority of gentiles, or</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in accordance with his opinion <b>even</b> in a place <b>where there is a majority of Jews?</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who finds coins in synagogues [<i>bevatei khenesiyyot</i>] and study halls or in any place where the multitudes are found, these</b> coins belong <b>to him, due to</b> the fact <b>that the owner despairs of their</b> recovery. <b>Who</b> is the one about <b>whom you heard that he follows the multitudes,</b> i.e., that he attaches significance to the loss of an item in a place where the multitudes are present? It is <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar. Conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar holds that a lost item belongs to the finder <b>even</b> in a place <b>where there is a majority of Jews,</b> as synagogues and study halls are places frequented exclusively by Jews.

### Part 12
The Gemara rejects the proof. <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where</b> the coins are <b>scattered</b> and there is no distinguishing mark on them. The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> it is a case <b>where</b> the coins are <b>scattered, why</b> did the <i>baraita</i> establish the case <b>specifically</b> in <b>a place where the multitudes are found? Even</b> in a place where <b>the multitudes are not found,</b> the coins belong to the finder.

### Part 13
<b>Rather, actually</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the coins are <b>bound, and with what are we dealing here?</b> This is a case where the coins were found <b>in</b> the <b>houses of assembly [<i>bevatei khenesiyyot</i>] of gentiles,</b> not in synagogues. That resolves the matter of synagogues; but with regard to <b>study halls,</b> which are exclusive to Jews, <b>what can be said?</b> The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>our study halls in which gentile</b> guards or custodians <b>are sitting.</b> The Gemara notes: <b>Now that you have arrived at this</b> explanation, the <i>batei khenesiyyot</i> in the <i>baraita</i> can be explained as referring to <b>our synagogues, in which gentiles are sitting.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a mishna (<i>Makhshirin</i> 2:8): In a case when <b>one found a lost item in</b> a city where both Jews and gentiles reside, <b>if</b> the city has <b>a majority of Jews</b> he is <b>obligated to proclaim</b> his find. <b>If</b> there is <b>a majority of gentiles</b> he is <b>not obligated to proclaim</b> his find. <b>Who</b> is the one about <b>whom you heard that he follows the multitudes,</b> i.e., that he attaches significance to the loss of an item in a place where the multitudes are present? It is <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar. Resolve from</b> this mishna <b>that when Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says</b> that the item belongs to the finder, it is referring specifically to a place <b>where there is a majority of gentiles, but</b> in a place <b>where there is a majority of Jews, no,</b> it does not belong to the finder.

### Part 15
The Gemara rejects this proof: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? It <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> The Gemara suggests: In any case, <b>resolve</b> the dilemma <b>from</b> the mishna <b>that the Rabbis concede to Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar</b> in a place <b>where there is a majority of gentiles.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara rejects this explanation: <b>Rather, actually</b> the mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, and</b> he stated his opinion <b>even in</b> a place <b>where there is a majority of Jews. And with what are we dealing here?</b> This is a case <b>where</b> the found item is <b>concealed.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> the item is <b>concealed, what</b> is the reason the item <b>is with</b> the finder? Clearly it was placed there and the owner will return to retrieve it. <b>And didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (25b): In a case where <b>one found a vessel in a garbage dump,</b> if the vessel is <b>concealed he may not touch it,</b> but if it is <b>exposed,</b> the finder <b>takes</b> the item <b>and proclaims</b> his find.

### Part 17
The Gemara answers: It can be explained <b>as Rav Pappa says</b> elsewhere, that it is referring <b>to a garbage dump that is not designed to be cleared, and</b> the owner of the land <b>reconsidered</b> and decided <b>to clear it.</b> If one finds concealed vessels he should proclaim his find, because otherwise the vessels will be cleared with the rest of the garbage dump. <b>Here too,</b> the mishna is referring <b>to a garbage dump that is not designed to be cleared, and</b> the owner of the land <b>reconsidered</b> and decided <b>to clear it.</b> If one finds concealed items, his course of action is determined by the identity of the majority of the residents of the city. If they are Jews, he must proclaim his find, and if not, he need not proclaim his find. No proof can be cited to resolve the dilemma.
