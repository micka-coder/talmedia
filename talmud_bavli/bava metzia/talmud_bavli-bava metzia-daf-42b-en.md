### Part 1
With regard to <b>anyone who deposits</b> an item with another, it is <b>with the awareness</b> that at times, the bailee’s <b>wife and his children</b> will safeguard the item that <b>he deposits</b> it. Therefore, I was within my rights to give the deposit to my mother.

### Part 2
<b>Let us say to his mother: Go</b> and <b>pay.</b> She can <b>say:</b> My son <b>did not tell me that</b> the money <b>is not his</b> so <b>that I should bury it,</b> which is the optimal method to safeguard money.

### Part 3
<b>Let us say to</b> the bailee: <b>Why did you not say to her</b> that the money is not yours? <b>He</b> can <b>say: All the more so</b> that my omission of this information was preferable, <b>as when I say to her that</b> the money <b>is mine, she is</b> even <b>more careful with it.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rather, Rava said:</b> The bailee <b>takes an oath that he gave</b> the money <b>to his mother, and his mother takes an oath that she placed the money in the chest and it was stolen, and</b> the bailee is <b>exempt</b> from payment.

### Part 5
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain steward</b> who acted on behalf <b>of orphans, who purchased an ox for the orphans and passed it to the cowherd.</b> This ox <b>did not have molars and</b> other <b>teeth with which to eat, and</b> the ox <b>died</b> because it was unable to eat the standard food of oxen. <b>Rami bar Ḥama said: How should judges rule in this case?</b>

### Part 6
<b>Let them say to the steward: Go pay</b> for the dead ox. But he can <b>say: I gave it to the cowherd</b> with the expectation that he would care for it.

### Part 7
<b>Let us say to the cowherd: Go pay</b> for the dead ox. <b>He</b> can <b>say: I placed</b> the ox <b>with</b> other <b>oxen and I threw food before it. We did not know that it did not eat.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>After all, the cowherd is a paid bailee of the orphans.</b> Therefore, <b>he was required to examine</b> the situation and ascertain if the ox was eating. The Gemara answers: <b>If there was loss for the orphans, indeed,</b> the cowherd would be liable to pay. <b>And with what are we dealing here?</b> It is a case <b>where there is no loss</b> incurred <b>by the orphans, as they found the</b> previous <b>owner of the ox,</b> who sold it to them, <b>and the orphans took</b> their <b>money</b> back <b>from him</b> after discovering that the ox had this deficiency.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>Rather, who</b> then <b>claims</b> compensation from the cowherd? <b>The</b> previous <b>owner of the ox claims</b> compensation from the steward: <b>He should have informed us</b> that the ox was not eating. The Gemara answers: <b>What</b> would <b>we inform</b> the previous owner? <b>He knows that it is a mistaken transaction,</b> as he would be aware that the ox had no teeth. The Gemara explains: This is a case <b>with regard to a trader who buys from here and sells to there</b> and does not know the condition of the ox. <b>Therefore,</b> the trader <b>takes an oath</b> that <b>he did not know</b> about the ox’s defect, <b>and the cowherd pays the value of the meat</b> of the ox <b>based on</b> the <b>cheapest</b> price available in the market.

### Part 10
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain man who deposited hops,</b> used in the production of beer, <b>with another.</b> The bailee <b>himself had a pile of hops.</b> The bailee <b>said to his brewer: Cast</b> hops in the beer <b>from this</b> pile. The brewer <b>went and cast from</b> the <b>other</b> pile, the pile of the one who deposited the hops, into the beer. <b>Rav Amram said: How should judges rule in this case?</b>

### Part 11
<b>Let us say to</b> the bailee: <b>Go pay.</b> But he can <b>say: I said to him,</b> i.e., the brewer: <b>Cast</b> hops <b>from this</b> pile, and I am not at fault.

### Part 12
<b>Let us say to the brewer: Go pay.</b> He can <b>say:</b> The bailee <b>did not say to me: Cast</b> hops <b>from this</b> pile <b>and do not cast</b> hops <b>from that</b> pile. I thought he was merely giving advice, and I did not know that he was insistent that I refrain from using the other hops.

### Part 13
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> if the hops of the bailee were closer to where he and the brewer were located than those that were deposited with him, the bailee should be liable. As, <b>if</b> the brewer <b>delayed</b> bringing the hops for the <b>period</b> of time that it would take <b>to bring</b> the bailee hops from his own pile <b>and he did not</b> yet <b>bring them to him,</b> it is assumed that the bailee understood that the brewer had gone to bring the more distant, deposited, hops. By not objecting, the bailee <b>revealed that he was amenable</b> to brewing the beer from the deposited hops. The Gemara answers: This is a case <b>where he did not delay</b> bringing the hops, or alternatively, the two piles were equidistant from him.

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>Ultimately, what loss is there? But doesn’t</b> the bailee <b>profit</b> in this case? Let the bailee give the owner beer equal to the value of the hops that he took from the deposit and no one loses. <b>Rav Sama, son of Rava, said:</b> The Gemara is referring to a case <b>where the beer</b> ferments and <b>becomes vinegar.</b> Therefore, it is impossible to take the value of the hops from the beer. <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> It is referring to a case where the hops were mixed <b>with thorns</b> and did not enhance the beer.
