### Part 1
<b>until it sees the front of the house</b> through which people enter and exit, and it is brought into the house through that entrance, <b>as it is stated</b> in the formula of the declaration of the tithes: <b>“I have removed the consecrated from the house”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:13), which indicates that the obligation to tithe produce whose purpose has not yet been designated applies only when it is brought into the house.

### Part 2
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Even</b> bringing produce into the <b>courtyard determines</b> that the production process of the produce has been completed and that the produce is therefore subject to tithes, <b>as it is stated</b> in the confession of the tithes: “And I have given to the Levite, the stranger, the orphan, and the widow, <b>and they shall eat in your gates and be satisfied”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:12).

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan also, isn’t it written: “From the house”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He</b> could have <b>said to you</b> that the term “house” is not to be taken literally. Rather, it indicates that bringing untithed produce into <b>a courtyard is similar to</b> bringing it into <b>a house,</b> in the following way: <b>Just as a house</b> is <b>a secured</b> area, <b>so too, the courtyard</b> must be <b>secured.</b> An area that is accessible to the public is not considered a courtyard for the purposes of this <i>halakha</i>.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rabbi Yannai also, isn’t it written: “In your gates”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> term <b>is necessary</b> to teach <b>that</b> this <i>halakha</i>, that the production process is considered complete, applies only <b>when one brings</b> the produce into his house <b>through the gate,</b> i.e., the entranceway, <b>to the exclusion of</b> produce that was brought in <b>through rooftops and enclosures,</b> in <b>which</b> case the produce is <b>not</b> subject to tithes.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Ḥanina Ḥoza’a raises an objection</b> from a statement of the <i>baraita</i> mentioned earlier (87b): The term “at your own pleasure [<i>kenafshekha</i>]” can also mean: As you are. Consequently, the term <b><i>kenafshekha</i></b> teaches that just as the <i>halakha</i> is concerning the owner of the vineyard himself, <b>so is</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>the laborer himself: Just as</b> the owner, alluded to by the term <b><i>nafshekha</i>, may eat</b> from the produce before its labor is complete <b>and</b> is <b>exempt</b> from separating tithes, <b>so too, the laborer himself may eat</b> and is <b>exempt</b> from tithes.

### Part 6
The objection of Rav Ḥanina Ḥoza’a is as follows: This indicates that only an owner and a laborer may eat from produce without tithing it; <b>but one who buys</b> produce is <b>obligated</b> by Torah law to separate tithes before partaking of it. <b>What, is it not</b> correct to conclude that this is the <i>halakha</i> even when he purchased the produce while it was still <b>in the field,</b> i.e., he is obligated to tithe the produce even though it has not entered his house or courtyard?

### Part 7
<b>Rav Pappa said: Here,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>we are dealing with a fig tree that is standing in a garden</b> outside a courtyard <b>and its leaves are leaning into a courtyard, or, according to the one who says</b> that the obligation to separate tithes applies when the produce is brought <b>into the house,</b> the branches are leaning <b>into the house.</b> Therefore, the produce entered the courtyard or house.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, the homeowner</b> himself, not only the buyer, <b>should also be obligated</b> to separate tithes, as the produce is in either the courtyard or the house. The Gemara answers: <b>The homeowner’s eyes are on his fig tree,</b> i.e., his primary concern is the tree, not its produce, and the main part of the tree is outside the courtyard. <b>But the buyer’s eyes are on his purchase,</b> i.e., his focus is on the produce itself, which is in the space of the courtyard or house.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>And is a buyer obligated by Torah law</b> to tithe the produce he purchases? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>For what reason were the shops of Beit Hino,</b> a town near Jerusalem, <b>destroyed three years before</b> the destruction of <b>Jerusalem</b> itself? It was <b>because they based their practices</b> strictly <b>on matters of Torah,</b> i.e., they did not adhere to the rabbinic safeguards. The <i>baraita</i> explains <b>that they would say</b>
