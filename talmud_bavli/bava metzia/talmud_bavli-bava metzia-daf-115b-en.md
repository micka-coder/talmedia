### Part 1
<b>it comes to</b> teach <b>about</b> the prohibition <b>against</b> taking as collateral <b>other items</b> used in the preparation of food.

### Part 2
§ The Gemara suggests: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>Abaye and Rava,</b> in another dispute, <b>disagree with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of this <b>dispute between Rav Huna and Rav Yehuda</b> concerning the collateral? The Torah commands with regard to the preparation of the Paschal offering: “Do not eat of it raw, nor cooked in water, but roasted with fire, its head with its legs and with the innards thereof” (Exodus 12:9). Abaye and Rava engage in a dispute concerning the case of one who ate the meat when it was not properly roasted.

### Part 3
<b>As Rava says:</b> If he <b>ate</b> an olive-bulk of it <b>raw,</b> he <b>is flogged</b> with <b>two</b> sets of lashes. One set of lashes is <b>due to</b> the prohibition: “Do not eat of it <b>raw,” and</b> the other is <b>due to</b> the prohibition: <b>“But roasted with fire.”</b> If he ate an olive-bulk of a Paschal offering that had been <b>cooked,</b> he also <b>is flogged</b> with <b>two</b> sets of lashes: One set of lashes is <b>due to</b> the prohibition against it being <b>cooked</b> in water, <b>and</b> the second is <b>due to</b> the injunction: <b>“But roasted with fire.”</b> If he ate an olive-bulk of both <b>raw</b> meat <b>and cooked</b> meat, he <b>is flogged</b> with <b>three</b> sets of lashes: One set of lashes is <b>due to</b> the prohibition against it being <b>raw, and</b> the second is <b>due to</b> the prohibition against it being <b>cooked, and</b> the third is <b>due to</b> the prohibition: <b>“Do not eat of it…but roasted with fire.”</b>

### Part 4
Conversely, <b>Abaye says:</b> The prohibition “Do not eat of it…but roasted with fire” is not referring exclusively to this issue, but includes many cases, and one <b>is not flogged for</b> violating <b>a general prohibition.</b> In this case, Abaye and Rava apparently disagree over the same matter as do Rav Huna and Rav Yehuda. <b>Shall we say that Abaye states</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yehuda, and Rava states</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna?</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara responds: <b>Rava</b> could have <b>said to you: I state</b> my opinion <b>even in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yehuda,</b> as there is a difference between the two cases: <b>Rav Yehuda states</b> his opinion <b>only there,</b> with regard to collateral, <b>because</b> the phrase: <b>“For he takes a man’s life as collateral”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:6), <b>does not</b> itself <b>indicate</b> that the verse is referring to <b>the lower and upper millstones.</b> Rather, it is a general statement, and <b>therefore it comes to</b> teach <b>about</b> the prohibition <b>against</b> taking as collateral <b>other items</b> used in the preparation of food, not to add a prohibition to take as collateral the lower and upper millstones.

### Part 6
<b>But here,</b> the phrase <b>“but roasted with fire” comes for what</b> purpose? It excludes only raw or cooked meat, which were already mentioned. Therefore, <b>learn from</b> it that it comes <b>to</b> include another <b>prohibition</b> in addition to those specific directives referring to raw and cooked meat.

### Part 7
<b>And Abaye</b> could have <b>said to you: I state</b> my opinion <b>even in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna.</b> This is because <b>Rav Huna states</b> his opinion <b>only there,</b> with regard to collateral, <b>because</b> the prohibition <b>“For he takes a man’s life as collateral”</b>
