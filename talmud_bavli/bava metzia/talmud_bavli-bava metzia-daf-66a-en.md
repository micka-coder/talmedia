### Part 1
<b>These are merely words of enticement [<i>pittumei millei</i>]</b> designed to encourage the buyer, but they are not part of a legal contract and therefore do not obligate the seller. <b>Rav Ashi said to Ameimar: What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Since the buyer</b> is the one who <b>needs to stipulate</b> this condition but he neglected to do so, <b>and here</b> it was <b>the seller who stipulated</b> the condition, is that why <b>you said</b> that <b>these are merely words of enticement?</b>

### Part 2
<b>But</b> according to this reasoning, consider <b>the <i>baraita</i>, as it teaches</b> that if the buyer says: <b>When you have money I will give</b> the property <b>back to you,</b> this is <b>permitted.</b> Now in this case <b>it is the seller who needs to stipulate</b> this condition, but the <b>seller did not stipulate</b> it <b>and</b> it was <b>the buyer</b> who <b>stipulated</b> it. Accordingly, they should likewise be regarded as words of enticement.

### Part 3
<b>And we said</b> concerning the <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is different</b> in <b>the first clause and what is different</b> in <b>the latter clause? And Rava says</b> that <b>the latter clause</b> is referring to a situation <b>where</b> the buyer <b>said</b> he would return the field <b>of his own accord.</b> Rav Ashi infers: The <b>reason</b> the condition is invalid is that the buyer <b>said to him</b> that he would return the field <b>of his own accord. But if he did not say to him</b> that he would return the field <b>of his own accord, we</b> would <b>not say</b> that <b>these are merely words of enticement,</b> even though the statement was made by the buyer about himself, and not as a condition by the seller.

### Part 4
Ameimar <b>said to him:</b> In fact, any condition stated by the wrong person is invalid, but it <b>was stated</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that whenever the buyer states such a condition, he is <b>considered like one who said</b> that he would return the field <b>of his own accord.</b>

### Part 5
§ The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain person on his deathbed who wrote a bill of divorce for his wife</b> in order to exempt her from the obligation of <i>ḥalitza</i> in the event of his death, and <b>he moaned and sighed</b> at the time, in distress over having to divorce her. <b>She said to him: Why do you sigh? If you recover</b> from this illness, <b>I am yours,</b> as I will marry you again. The Gemara discusses the legal validity of this promise. <b>Rav Zevid said: These are merely words of enticement</b> designed to encourage him to grant the divorce, but they do not actually obligate the wife to remarry him if he lives.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Aḥa of Difti said to Ravina: And</b> even <b>if they were not</b> merely <b>words of enticement,</b> but she had made an actual condition upheld by an oath or an act of acquisition, <b>what</b> of it? Is it <b>her</b> prerogative <b>to stipulate a condition</b> concerning her <b>bill of divorce?</b> It is not in her power to do so, as it is <b>his</b> right <b>to establish</b> such <b>a condition,</b> and since he failed to do so explicitly, any condition she accepts upon herself is of no consequence. The Gemara answers: This statement of Rav Zevid is necessary, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>he himself relied upon her</b> condition when he <b>decided</b> to <b>give her the bill of divorce,</b> and therefore it is as though he stipulated the condition. Rav Zevid therefore <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case.

### Part 7
§ The mishna teaches: If one <b>lent</b> money <b>to</b> another <b>on</b> the basis of <b>his field</b> serving as a guarantee, and he said to borrower: If you do not give me the money from now until three years have passed, your field is mine, then if his money is not returned within three years, the field is his. <b>Rav Huna says:</b> If the lender stated the condition <b>at the time of the giving of the money, he has acquired it all,</b> meaning that if the borrower fails to pay the debt, the entire field is transferred to the lender. But if the lender stated his condition at some point <b>after the giving of the money, he has acquired only</b> a portion of the field <b>corresponding to the money</b> that <b>he</b> lent. <b>And Rav Naḥman says: Even</b> if the lender stated his condition <b>after the giving of the money, he has acquired it all.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Naḥman performed an action in the court of the Exilarch in accordance with his statement</b> that even if the lender states his condition after the loan is granted, the lender acquires the entire field if the loan isn’t repaid within the specified time period. The case then came before <b>Rav Yehuda,</b> who <b>tore up</b> the lender’s <b>deed</b> of ownership of the field, claiming it was invalid. <b>The Exilarch said</b> to Rav Naḥman: <b>Rav Yehuda tore up your document,</b> i.e., he overruled your decision. Rav Naḥman <b>said to him:</b> Did <b>a child tear it up? A great man tore it up;</b> he must have <b>seen in it</b> some <b>reason</b> to invalidate it, <b>and</b> that is why he <b>tore it up.</b>

### Part 9
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> a different version of this exchange, according to which Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: A child tore it up,</b> i.e., there is no need to take his opinion into consideration, <b>as everyone is</b> like <b>a child relative to me with regard to</b> monetary <b>laws.</b> Rav Naḥman was the greatest expert of his generation with regard to monetary matters, and therefore he could discount the opinions of others.

### Part 10
After examining the matter again, <b>Rav Naḥman</b> retracted his words and <b>then said</b> the opposite of his initial ruling: <b>Even</b> if the lender stated his condition <b>at the time of the giving of the money, he has not acquired anything. Rava raised an objection to Rav Naḥman</b> from the mishna, which teaches: If one lent money to another on the basis of the borrower’s field serving as a guarantee, and said to him: <b>If you do not give me</b> the money now and instead delay your payment <b>from now until three years</b> have passed, the field <b>is mine,</b> then after three years, the field <b>is his.</b> Evidently, a condition of this kind is valid.

### Part 11
Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: I</b> used to <b>say</b> that <b>a transaction with inconclusive consent [<i>asmakhta</i>] effects acquisition,</b> meaning that any obligation one accepts to serve as a penalty over and above the value of what he actually owes is nevertheless binding. <b>But Minyumi said</b> that <b>an <i>asmakhta</i> does not effect acquisition,</b> and the transaction under discussion is an <i>asmakhta</i>. Now that he convinced me that his opinion is correct, I have retracted my previous opinion.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>the mishna</b> is <b>difficult according to Minyumi.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that <b>the mishna is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, who said</b> that <b>an <i>asmakhta</i> effects acquisition,</b> but his is a minority opinion.
