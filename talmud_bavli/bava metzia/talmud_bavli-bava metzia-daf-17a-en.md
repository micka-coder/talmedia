### Part 1
<b>and</b> later on the debtor <b>said: I repaid</b> him, his claim is <b>deemed credible.</b> He must take an oath and is exempt from payment. Therefore, if the <b>creditor comes</b> and asks the court <b>to write</b> an authorization for him to appropriate the property of the debtor, <b>they do not write</b> an authorization <b>and give</b> the document <b>to him.</b>

### Part 2
By contrast, if the court merely said: <b>You are liable to give him</b> what you owe him, but did not complete the process by saying: Go and give it to him, <b>and</b> later on the debtor <b>said: I repaid</b> the debt, his claim <b>is not deemed credible.</b> The assumption is that since he did not pay on his own without the need for litigation, he does not intend to pay until the court finalizes its verdict against him. Therefore, since the debtor is suspected of lying, the creditor takes an oath and collects what he is owed. In this case, if the <b>creditor comes</b> and asks the court <b>to write</b> an authorization for him to appropriate the property of the debtor, <b>they write</b> the document <b>and give</b> it <b>to him.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rav Zevid says in the name of Rabbi Naḥman: Both</b> in the case where the court said: <b>Go</b> and <b>give him</b> what you owe him, <b>and</b> in the case where the court said: <b>You are liable to give him,</b> if the debtor subsequently <b>said: I repaid</b> the debt, his claim is <b>deemed credible.</b> Therefore, if the <b>creditor comes</b> and asks the court <b>to write</b> an authorization, <b>they do not write</b> the document <b>and give</b> it <b>to him.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rather, if there is</b> room <b>to make a distinction</b> between different cases, <b>this is how there is</b> room <b>to distinguish</b> between them: If the court <b>said to</b> the debtor: <b>Go</b> and <b>give him</b> what you owe him, <b>and</b> subsequently the debtor <b>said: I repaid</b> the debt, <b>and the witnesses testify</b> concerning <b>him that he did not repay it</b> when the debt was demanded in their presence, <b>and</b> later the debtor <b>said again: I repaid</b> the debt, in such a case, the debtor <b>has assumed the presumptive status of one who denies</b> his debts with regard <b>to that money,</b> and he is no longer believed when he claims that he repaid the debt unless witnesses substantiate his claim.

### Part 5
By contrast, if the court said: <b>You are liable to give him</b> what you owe him, <b>and</b> subsequently the debtor <b>said: I repaid</b> the debt, <b>and the witnesses testify</b> concerning <b>him that he did not repay</b> the debt when it was demanded in their presence, <b>and</b> later the debtor <b>said again: I repaid,</b> in this case, the debtor <b>does not assume the presumptive status of one who denies</b> his debts <b>with regard to that money.</b> His claim that he repaid the debt in the absence of witnesses is accepted after he takes an oath to that effect.

### Part 6
<b>What is the reason</b> that he is not presumed to be lying? It is because before the court verdict was finalized, the debtor was merely trying to <b>evade</b> the creditor, <b>thinking</b> to himself: Since the court has not yet finalized the verdict, I can delay payment <b>until the Sages</b> in the court <b>investigate my case</b> further, as I am not actually liable to pay until the verdict is finalized.

### Part 7
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥanna says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If one says to another: <b>I</b> have <b>one hundred dinars in your possession</b> that you borrowed from me, <b>and the other says</b> in response: <b>Nothing</b> of <b>yours</b> is <b>in my possession, and the witnesses testify</b> concerning <b>him that,</b> in fact, <b>he does have</b> such a debt, <b>and subsequently</b> the debtor <b>said: I repaid</b> the debt, in that case the debtor <b>assumes the presumptive status of one who denies</b> his debts <b>with regard to that money.</b>

### Part 8
It is <b>like</b> the ruling in <b>this</b> case, <b>where Shabbtai, son of Rabbi Marinus, wrote</b> a pledge <b>to</b> give <b>his daughter-in-law a cloak [<i>itztela</i>] of fine wool [<i>demileta</i>] in her marriage contract, and</b> he <b>accepted upon himself</b> the status of a guarantor for the contract. <b>Her marriage contract was lost,</b> and there was a disagreement between the parties as to its content. Shabbtai <b>said to her: These matters never occurred;</b> I never wrote that I would give you such a cloak. <b>Witnesses</b> then <b>came and said: Yes, he did write her</b> this pledge. <b>Ultimately, he said to them: I paid it,</b> i.e., I gave her the cloak. This case <b>came before Rabbi Ḥiyya.</b> He <b>said to</b> Shabbtai: <b>You have assumed the presumptive status of one who denies</b> his debts <b>with regard to that cloak.</b> His claim was therefore not accepted, even by means of an oath.

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Avin says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ela says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If one <b>was obligated</b> to take <b>an oath to</b> counter <b>another</b> person’s claim brought against him, <b>and</b> later <b>he said: I took the oath, and the witnesses testify</b> against <b>him that he did not take an oath</b> when it was demanded of him in their presence, <b>and</b> the defendant subsequently <b>said again: I took the oath, he assumes the status of one who denies</b> his obligations <b>with regard to that oath.</b>

### Part 10
<b>The Rabbis stated</b> this ruling <b>before Rabbi Abbahu. He said to them: Rabbi Avin’s statement is reasonable</b> in a case <b>where</b> one <b>was obligated by a court to take an oath. But</b> if one voluntarily <b>obligated himself</b> to take <b>an oath,</b> and he later claims that he took the oath, he is <b>deemed credible.</b> This is because <b>a person is prone to say incidentally</b> that he will take an oath and then change his mind; this does not render him a liar. The Rabbis then <b>brought</b> Rabbi Abbahu’s analysis <b>back</b> to <b>Rabbi Avin</b> and presented it <b>before</b> him. Rabbi Avin <b>said to them: I also said</b> this <i>halakha</i> specifically with regard to one who was obligated <b>by a court</b> to take an oath, as Rabbi Abbahu explained.

### Part 11
<b>It was also stated</b> that <b>Rabbi Avin says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ela says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If one <b>was obligated by a court</b> to take <b>an oath to</b> counter the claim of <b>another</b> person, <b>and</b> he subsequently <b>said: I took the oath, and the witnesses testify</b> against <b>him that he did not take an oath</b> when it was demanded of him in their presence, <b>and</b> later the defendant <b>said again: I took the oath, he has assumed that status of one who denies</b> his obligations <b>with regard to that oath.</b> This wording is explicitly in accordance with Rabbi Abbahu’s explanation.

### Part 12
§ <b>Rabbi Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>one who finds a promissory note in the marketplace, and a ratification is written in it, and the date of</b> the loan <b>is written in it,</b> and evidently it was written <b>on that same day, he must return it to the owner,</b> i.e., the creditor.

### Part 13
The Gemara explains why there is no concern that perhaps the debtor does not owe the money: <b>If</b> one were to be concerned <b>because</b> perhaps the debtor <b>wrote</b> the promissory note intending <b>to borrow</b> money, <b>but</b> he ultimately <b>did not borrow</b> it, this is not a concern, as <b>a ratification is written in</b> the promissory note. Since only the creditor would have brought the note for ratification, it is clear that the loan occurred. And <b>if</b> one were to be concerned <b>because</b> perhaps there was <b>repayment,</b> this is not a concern, as <b>we are not concerned</b> that there was <b>repayment on the</b> same <b>day</b> that the loan was taken, since normally one would not take a loan for less than one day.

### Part 14
<b>Rabbi Zeira said to Rabbi Asi: Does Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> actually <b>say this? Isn’t it you who said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> that one <b>who borrowed</b> money and wrote a promissory <b>note for</b> the loan, <b>and</b> subsequently <b>repaid</b> the debt, <b>may not reuse it to borrow</b> another time, <b>as its lien is already forgiven</b> by virtue of the repayment? A promissory note is valid only for the debt for which it was written.

### Part 15
Rabbi Zeira explains: <b>When</b> did the debtor take the second loan? <b>If we say</b> that it was <b>the day after</b> the first loan, when the promissory note was written, <b>or another</b> later <b>date,</b> then Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement is difficult. <b>Why</b> does he <b>specifically</b> give as the reason for the promissory note’s disqualification: <b>As its lien is already forgiven?</b> Instead, he should <b>derive</b> the disqualification of the promissory note from the fact <b>that it is antedated,</b> i.e., dated prior to the actual loan, <b>and we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shevi’it</i> 10:5): <b>Antedated promissory notes are invalid.</b> Therefore, Rabbi Yoḥanan could not have been referring to a case where the second loan took place after the date of the first loan.

### Part 16
<b>Rather, is</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement <b>not</b> referring to a case where the second loan took place <b>on the</b> same <b>day</b> as the first loan? <b>Evidently, people do</b> occasionally <b>repay</b> their loans <b>on the</b> same <b>day</b> as they take the loan.

### Part 17
Rabbi Asi <b>said to him: Did I say that</b> people <b>do not repay</b> their loans on the same day <b>at all?</b> Rather, <b>I said that</b> it is <b>uncommon</b> for <b>people to repay</b> their loans <b>on the same day.</b> Therefore, if a note is found on the same day it was written, it is reasonable to assume that it has not yet been repaid, even though there is a remote possibility that it has.

### Part 18
<b>Rav Kahana says</b> an alternative explanation: Rabbi Yoḥanan is referring to a case <b>when</b> the <b>liable party,</b> i.e., the debtor, <b>admits</b> to the debt. The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so, what</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> that the note may be returned? This is obvious.

### Part 19
The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that even if <b>this</b> debtor admits to the debt, perhaps he actually <b>repaid</b> it, <b>and</b> the fact <b>that</b> the debtor <b>says: I did not repay it, is because he wants to go back</b> and use the promissory note <b>to borrow</b> money <b>again. And</b> the reason he prefers to claim that he did not repay the first debt is that he is <b>concerned about</b> saving <b>the scribe’s fee</b> that he would have to pay for another promissory note. Therefore, Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>teaches us</b> that this possibility need not be taken into account, <b>as, if that were so,</b> the <b>creditor himself would not allow</b> such a scheme. He would be afraid to act in such a manner, <b>thinking: The Sages will hear about me</b> that I reused the note, <b>and will cause me to lose</b> the payment owed to me.

### Part 20
The Gemara asks: In <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from that which we learned</b> in a mishna (12b): With regard to one who <b>found promissory notes, if they include a property guarantee</b> for a loan, <b>he may not return</b> them to the creditor.

### Part 21
<b>And we interpreted</b> this mishna as referring to a case <b>when the liable party admits</b> to the debt. <b>And</b> the reason the promissory notes may not be returned is <b>due to</b> the concern that <b>perhaps</b> the debtor <b>wrote</b> the note in order <b>to borrow</b> the money <b>in Nisan, but</b> he ultimately <b>did not borrow</b> it <b>until Tishrei, and</b> the creditor will <b>come to unlawfully repossess</b> land from <b>purchasers</b> who bought the debtor’s land <b>between Nisan and Tishrei.</b> He is entitled to collect land only from those who bought land from the debtor after the loan took place, causing the lien on the debtor’s land to take effect.

### Part 22
The Gemara points out the contradiction between this mishna and Rabbi Kahana’s explanation of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement: <b>And</b> this indicates that <b>we do not say that if that were so,</b> if the promissory note were antedated, the <b>creditor himself would not allow</b> the debtor to use it, <b>as he would say to him: Write another note</b> dated properly <b>in Tishrei, lest the Sages hear</b> about the fact that the date is incorrect <b>and</b> disqualify the promissory note, <b>causing me to lose</b> the money.

### Part 23
The Gemara answers: The Sages <b>say</b> that <b>there,</b> in the case of the mishna, <b>since</b> the creditor <b>benefits</b> by using this promissory note, <b>as</b> he can <b>repossess</b> land from <b>purchasers</b> who bought from the debtor <b>between Nisan and Tishrei, it is satisfactory to him, and he does not say anything</b> to the debtor about using this promissory note. By contrast, <b>here,</b> in the case to which Rabbi Yoḥanan is referring, <b>since</b> the creditor <b>does not benefit</b> from reusing the promissory note, <b>as ultimately, the note is written</b> for the <b>current</b> date, <b>what is there</b> for him <b>to repossess</b> from <b>purchasers</b> by means of the note that he cannot repossess by means of a new promissory note? Therefore, <b>he would not allow</b> the debtor to borrow more money from him <b>with</b> a promissory <b>note whose lien was forgiven,</b> as this would result only in risk and have no potential benefit.

### Part 24
§ <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>one who claims</b> to have repaid a debt that has <b>already</b> been established by <b>a court enactment,</b> i.e., a rabbinic ordinance obligating one to pay a debt, e.g., the main sum in a marriage contract, but he has no witnesses,
