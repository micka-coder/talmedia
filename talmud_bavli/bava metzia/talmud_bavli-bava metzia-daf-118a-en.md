### Part 1
<b>They are yours,</b> as I hereby declare them ownerless, and you can take them for yourself; the court <b>does not listen to him,</b> since he cannot force the other to acquire the stones. If <b>after</b> the owner of the garden voluntarily <b>accepted</b> ownership of the stones <b>upon himself,</b> the owner of the wall <b>said to him: Here you are,</b> take <b>your expenditures</b> for the removal of the stones, <b>and I will take</b> the stones that are <b>mine;</b> the court <b>does not listen to him,</b> as they had already been acquired by the owner of the garden.

### Part 2
The mishna continues: In the case of <b>one who hires a laborer to do</b> work <b>with him with hay or with straw, and</b> after he finished the task, the laborer <b>said to</b> the employer: <b>Give me my wages, and</b> the employer <b>said to him: Take what you have worked with as your wages,</b> i.e., take some of the hay or straw as payment, the court <b>does not listen to him.</b> Although debts can be paid with any item of value, even hay or straw, the wages of a laborer must be paid in accordance with the initial agreement between the laborer and the employer. But if <b>after</b> the laborer <b>accepted upon himself</b> to keep the hay or straw as payment, the employer changed his mind <b>and said to him: Here you are,</b> take <b>your wages and I will take</b> what is <b>mine;</b> the court <b>does not listen to him,</b> since the laborer had already acquired the hay.

### Part 3
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the case of the roof of the olive press that <b>was broken,</b> the Gemara cites a dispute with regard to the amount that collapsed: <b>Rav says: Most of it</b> must have collapsed, <b>and Shmuel says:</b> Even a hole <b>of four</b> cubits is sufficient for the ruling of the mishna to apply. <b>Rav says: Most of it</b> must have collapsed, <b>but</b> if it is only a hole <b>of four</b> cubits, there is no basis for a claim, since <b>a person</b> can <b>sow partially</b> on a level <b>below, and partially</b> on a level <b>above. And Shmuel says:</b> It is enough if it is a hole <b>of four</b> cubits, as <b>a person cannot sow partially</b> on a level <b>below, and partially</b> on a level <b>above.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for the dispute between Rav and Shmuel to be stated both here and with regard to the case of an upper story of a house that collapsed (116b). <b>As had</b> the Gemara <b>taught us only</b> that they disagree with regard to <b>a residence,</b> one would have said: It is only <b>in this</b> case that <b>Shmuel is saying</b> his ruling, <b>because people do not tend to live a little here and a little there, but with regard to sowing, people</b> do <b>tend to sow a little here and a little there.</b> Therefore, one might <b>say</b> that he <b>concedes to Rav</b> in the case of the olive press. <b>And if</b> this dispute <b>was stated</b> only <b>with regard to this</b> case of the olive press, one would have said that it is only <b>with regard to this</b> case that <b>Rav is saying</b> his opinion, <b>but with regard to that</b> case involving the house, one might <b>say</b> that he <b>concedes to Shmuel.</b> Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> to state that their dispute applies to both cases.

### Part 5
§ The mishna teaches: If the court saw that the wall was shaky, or that the tree was tilting, and <b>they gave him time</b> to cut down the tree or to dismantle the wall, and then they fell down, if this occurred during the allotted time, he is exempt, but if they collapsed after the time given to him had elapsed, he is liable to pay. The Gemara asks: <b>And how much time</b> will <b>a court</b> usually allot for this purpose? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The standard period is <b>thirty days.</b>

### Part 6
§ The mishna teaches: In the case of <b>one whose wall</b> was located next to his friend’s garden and it fell, if the owner of the wall told the owner of the garden to keep the stones, he cannot retract. The Gemara comments: <b>But from the fact that the last clause</b> of the mishna <b>teaches</b> that if the owner of the fallen wall says: <b>Here you are,</b> take <b>your expenditures,</b> the court does not listen to him, it can be understood <b>by inference</b> that <b>we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> the owner of the garden <b>cleared</b> away the stones. It can therefore be deduced that the <b>reason</b> the owner of the fallen wall cannot retract his offer is <b>that</b> the owner of the garden <b>cleared them</b> away, <b>but</b> if <b>he did not clear them</b> away, the stones are <b>not</b> considered his, and they remain in the possession of the owner of the wall.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> do they remain in the possession of the owner of the wall? <b>But shouldn’t</b> the owner of the garden’s <b>field effect acquisition</b> of the stones on <b>his</b> behalf? <b>As Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: The courtyard of a person effects acquisition for him</b> of those items that enter it, even <b>without his knowledge.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: <b>This statement</b> applies only in a case <b>where</b> the giver <b>intends to transfer them to him,</b> in which case the field can effect acquisition of the stones for the receiver without an additional act of acquisition, <b>but here,</b> the owner of the fallen wall <b>is</b> seeking only to <b>evade</b> the owner of the garden. He wants the owner of the garden to take care of the stones, at which point he can collect them from him without much effort on his part, and he does not intend to give the stones to him.

### Part 9
§ The mishna teaches: In the case of <b>one who hires</b> a laborer <b>to do</b> work <b>with him with hay,</b> the employer cannot force him to accept his wages in the form of some of the hay. The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to mention this <i>halakha</i> with regard to both cases.

### Part 10
<b>As had it taught us</b> only <b>with regard to this first</b> case of the stones that fell <b>that when</b> the owner of the fallen wall <b>says to</b> the owner of the garden: <b>They are yours,</b> the court <b>does not listen to him,</b> one would have said that this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>because he does not have a wage</b> owed <b>by him,</b> as they had no prior business dealings together, and the owner of the stones does not owe the owner of the garden anything. <b>But here,</b> in the case of a laborer working with hay, in <b>which</b> the laborer <b>does have a wage</b> owed <b>by</b> the employer, one might <b>say</b> that the court <b>listens to him, as people say</b> the following proverb: When collecting a debt <b>from your debtor,</b> allow yourself to be <b>repaid</b> even in <b>bran [<i>parei</i>],</b> i.e., take whatever you can as payment of a loan.

### Part 11
<b>And had it taught us</b> only over <b>here</b> with regard to the hay, one would have said that it is only <b>here that after</b> the laborer <b>has</b> already <b>accepted</b> ownership <b>upon himself,</b> the court <b>does not listen to</b> the employer who desires to retract, <b>because</b> the laborer <b>has a wage</b> owed <b>by him,</b> and therefore there is reason to say that he receives the hay. <b>But here,</b> with regard to the stones, <b>where</b> the owner of the garden <b>does not have a wage</b> owed <b>by</b> the owner of the fallen wall, one might <b>say</b> that the court <b>listens to him</b> and he can retract. It is therefore <b>necessary</b> for the mishna to teach both cases.

### Part 12
§ The mishna teaches that if an employer seeks to pay his laborer with straw, the court <b>does not listen to him.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the court <b>does listen to him?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> This is <b>not difficult.</b> The ruling of the mishna <b>here,</b> that the court does not listen to him, is stated <b>with regard to</b> a case of work done with the employer’s <b>own</b> property. And the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> <b>there,</b> that the court does listen to him, is stated <b>with regard to</b> work done with the property <b>of another,</b> and there the employer’s request is accepted.

### Part 13
<b>Rava said to Rav Naḥman: In</b> a case where he is working with <b>his own</b> property, <b>what is the reason</b> that the court does not listen to him? <b>As</b> the laborer can <b>say to</b> the employer: The responsibility of paying my <b>wage is on you.</b> But if he was working <b>with</b> the property <b>of his friend,</b> the responsibility of paying <b>his earnings is also on</b> the employer, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who hires a laborer to perform</b> work <b>in his own</b> field, <b>and</b> the employer inadvertently <b>showed</b> the laborer the field <b>belonging to another</b> in which he should work, the employer <b>must give</b> the laborer <b>his full wages, and</b> in addition, the employer <b>goes back and takes from the owner</b> of the field in which he worked the value of <b>the benefit</b> that owner <b>received from</b> the laborer. The payment of the wages is incumbent upon the employer, not the owner of the field.

### Part 14
<b>Rather, Rav Naḥman said</b> a different explanation: It is <b>not difficult.</b> The ruling of the mishna <b>here,</b> that the court does not listen to him, is stated <b>with regard to</b> work done with the employer’s <b>own</b> property. And the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> <b>there,</b> that the court does listen to him, is stated <b>with regard to</b> work done with <b>ownerless</b> property, e.g., the employer hired him to gather ownerless hay, and later told him to keep some of the hay as his wages. In that case, he can force the laborer to accept the hay as payment.

### Part 15
<b>Rava raised an objection to Rav Naḥman:</b> It was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The found item of</b> a salaried <b>laborer</b> belongs <b>to himself. When</b> is this so? <b>When the employer told him</b> to perform a specific task, for example if he said: <b>Weed with me today, or</b> if he said: <b>Hoe with me today.</b> If the laborer finds lost property while performing that task, then the item belongs to him. <b>But if</b> the employer <b>says to</b> the laborer: <b>Work with me today,</b> without specifying what labor he wants him to perform, <b>his found item</b> belongs <b>to the employer,</b> as acquiring found items can be considered part of his terms of employment. In the case of Rav Naḥman, since the employer instructed the laborer to gather ownerless hay, the acquisition of the hay is certainly part of the terms of his employment, and belongs to the employer. Since it is the employer’s property, he is not able to force the laborer to accept the hay as payment.

### Part 16
<b>Rather, Rav Naḥman said:</b> Both the ruling of the mishna and the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> are stated with regard to a laborer hired to work with ownerless property, but it is <b>not difficult.</b> The ruling of the mishna <b>here,</b> that the court does not listen to him, is stated <b>with regard to</b> a case where the laborer’s task was to <b>lift</b> up the hay and gather it, and he is therefore considered the employer’s agent and acquires the hay for him. Since the hay then belongs to the employer, he cannot force the laborer to accept it as payment. And the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> <b>there,</b> that the court does listen to him, is stated <b>with regard to</b> a case where his work merely consisted of <b>viewing,</b> e.g., he hired him to make sure that no one takes the ownerless hay. In that case, even the employer does not acquire the straw, and it remains ownerless. Consequently, the employer can tell the laborer to take some hay as payment.

### Part 17
<b>Rabba says:</b> The issue of whether, <b>in</b> the case of <b>ownerless</b> property, <b>viewing</b> effects acquisition of it <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 9b): The <b>watchmen of</b> the <b><i>sefiḥim</i>,</b> grain that grew without being purposely planted, <b>of the Sabbatical</b> Year ensured that people did not take this ownerless grain, so that it remained available to be used for the <i>omer</i> offering and the two loaves, i.e., the public offering on <i>Shavuot</i> of two loaves from the new wheat. These watchmen <b>take their wages from</b> the <b>collection of the</b> Temple treasury <b>chamber,</b> as they are employed by the Temple treasury. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: One who</b> so <b>desires</b> can <b>volunteer</b> his services and safeguard the grain, <b>and</b> he has the status of <b>an unpaid bailee.</b> The Rabbis <b>said to him:</b> Do <b>you say so?</b> But according to your view, the <i>omer</i> and the two loaves <b>do not come from communal</b> funds as required, since in reality they come from a private individual, i.e., the bailee.

### Part 18
The Gemara suggests: <b>What, is it not with regard to this that they disagree: The first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that <b>in</b> the case of <b>ownerless</b> property, <b>viewing effects acquisition</b> of it, and so the watchman, although he did not lift up the grain, acquires the grain by viewing it. <b>And</b> therefore, <b>if he is given a wage</b> from communal funds, then <b>yes,</b> he is safeguarding it on behalf of the community, and he acquires it for them. <b>But if</b> he is <b>not</b> paid, he has <b>not</b> acquired it for the community, but for himself. <b>And,</b> conversely, <b>Rabbi Yosei holds</b> that <b>in</b> the case of <b>ownerless</b> property, <b>viewing does not effect acquisition</b> of it, <b>and when</b> the <b>community goes and brings</b> the grain for the <i>omer</i> offering and the two loaves, <b>it is</b> only <b>now,</b> at this stage, <b>that they acquire it.</b>

### Part 19
<b>And what,</b> according to this explanation, is the meaning of the phrase: Do <b>you say</b> so? <b>This is what they were saying to him:</b> If the opinion <b>from your statement</b> that one may volunteer as an unpaid bailee is applied <b>to our statement</b> that in the case of ownerless property, viewing effects acquisition, the result is that the <b><i>omer</i> offering and the two loaves do not come from communal</b> funds as required.

### Part 20
<b>Rava said: No;</b> the dispute can be explained differently. It can be explained <b>that everyone</b> agrees that <b>in</b> the case of <b>ownerless</b> property, <b>viewing effects acquisition, and here they disagree</b> with regard to the question of whether <b>we are concerned</b> that <b>perhaps he will not give</b> the grain <b>over wholeheartedly</b> to the community. <b>As the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>we give</b> the watchman <b>a wage, and if</b> we do <b>not</b> pay him, but allow him to act as a volunteer, <b>we are concerned</b> that <b>perhaps he will not give</b> the grain <b>over wholeheartedly</b> to the community, as deep down he might feel that the grain really belongs to him and that he is offering it from his own pocket, which means that the <i>omer</i> offering and two loaves are not properly offered by the community.

### Part 21
Conversely, <b>Rabbi Yosei holds</b> that <b>we are not concerned</b> that <b>perhaps he will not hand</b> the grain <b>over wholeheartedly</b> to the community. <b>And what</b> is the meaning of the phrase: Do <b>you say</b> so? <b>This is what they were saying to him:</b> If the opinion <b>from your statement</b> that one may volunteer as an unpaid bailee is applied <b>to our statement that we are concerned</b> that <b>perhaps he will not give</b> the grain <b>over wholeheartedly,</b> the result is that the <b><i>omer</i> offering and</b> the <b>two loaves do not come from communal</b> funds as required.

### Part 22
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that there is a different version of this discussion: <b>Rava said:</b> It can be explained <b>that everyone</b> agrees that <b>in</b> the case of <b>ownerless</b> property, <b>viewing does not effect acquisition</b> of it, <b>and here,</b> concerning the <i>omer</i> offering, <b>they disagree with regard to</b> the question of whether <b>we are concerned about violent people</b> that may come and seize the grain for themselves. <b>As the first <i>tanna</i> holds that the Sages instituted</b> a directive <b>to give him four dinars,</b> or whatever payment is appropriate for his services as a watchman, <b>so that violent people should hear</b> of this <b>and keep away from</b> the grain, since when they hear that the Temple is paying the watchmen, they will certainly not take the grain. <b>And Rabbi Yosei holds</b> that the Sages <b>did not institute</b> this directive, since there is no concern about violent people.
