### Part 1
<b>teach</b> the same phrase: <b>One who lent to another</b> based <b>on collateral,</b> which indicates that the collateral was given at the time of the loan? <b>Rather,</b> the Gemara proposes a different resolution: It is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where he lent him money,</b> whereas <b>there,</b> the mishna is referring to a situation <b>where he lent him produce.</b> Since produce will spoil, the lender benefits from the deal, as he will receive fresher produce in return. Therefore, he is considered a paid bailee for the collateral.

### Part 2
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But from</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause</b> of the mishna <b>teaches</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One who lent</b> another <b>money</b> is <b>an unpaid bailee,</b> whereas <b>one who lent</b> another <b>produce</b> is <b>a paid bailee, by inference</b> you can conclude that according to <b>the first <i>tanna</i> there is no difference</b> between one who lends money and one who lends produce. If so, the proposed resolution does not fit the text.

### Part 3
The Gemara responds: <b>The entire</b> mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, and</b> the mishna <b>is incomplete and this is what it is teaching: One who lent to</b> another based <b>on collateral is a paid bailee. In what</b> case <b>is this statement said? When he lent him produce. But</b> if <b>he lent him money,</b> he is <b>an unpaid bailee. As Rabbi Yehuda says: One who lent</b> another <b>money</b> is <b>an unpaid bailee</b> with regard to the collateral, whereas <b>one who lent produce</b> is <b>a paid bailee.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If that is so,</b> it turns out that <b>the mishna is established not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b> This is problematic, as most of the Sages of the mishna were Rabbi Akiva’s students, and anonymous <i>mishnayot</i> are generally presumed to follow his rulings. <b>Rather, it is clear</b> that <b>the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that the dispute between Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Eliezer applies only <b>in</b> a case <b>where</b> the <b>collateral is not equal</b> to <b>the monetary value</b> of the loan, <b>and they disagree with regard to</b> a statement <b>of Shmuel. As Shmuel says:</b> With regard to <b>one who lends one thousand dinars to another and</b> the borrower <b>puts before</b> the lender as collateral <b>for</b> the loan <b>the handle of a sickle,</b> which is worth only a small fraction of the loan, nevertheless, if <b>the sickle is lost, the thousand dinars are lost.</b> The Gemara is suggesting that Rabbi Akiva would agree with this ruling, whereas Rabbi Eliezer would disagree with it.

### Part 6
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>If</b> the case is one <b>where</b> the <b>collateral is not equal</b> to <b>the amount of money</b> constituting the loan, <b>everyone holds</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>not</b> in accordance with the opinion <b>of Shmuel. But here</b> the dispute is referring <b>to</b> a situation <b>where</b> the collateral does <b>equal the amount of the money</b> constituting the loan, <b>and they disagree with regard to</b> a statement <b>of Rabbi Yitzḥak.</b>

### Part 7
<b>As Rabbi Yitzḥak says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a creditor acquires collateral</b> given to him and is considered its owner as long as the item is in his possession? It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated:</b> “You shall return the pledge to him when the sun goes down that he may sleep in his garment, and bless you; <b>and it shall be a righteousness for you</b> before the Lord your God” (Exodus 24:13). Rabbi Yitzḥak infers: <b>If</b> the creditor <b>does not acquire the collateral,</b> then <b>from where is the righteousness</b> involved in returning it? In this case, the creditor would not be giving up anything of his own. <b>From here</b> it is derived <b>that a creditor acquires the collateral.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>And</b> can <b>you understand</b> it that way? You can <b>say that Rabbi Yitzḥak stated</b> this <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where</b> he <b>took his collateral not at the time of his loan</b> but at a later stage, in order to collect his debt. <b>But did</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak <b>say</b> this ruling in a situation where he <b>took his collateral at the time of his loan?</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rather,</b> if <b>he took his collateral not at the time of his loan, everyone holds</b> in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yitzḥak. And here</b> it is discussing a case <b>where he took his collateral at the time of his loan, and</b> Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Akiva <b>disagree with regard to</b> the case of <b>a bailee of a lost item. As it was stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> disagreed concerning the responsibility of <b>the bailee for a lost item.</b> If someone found a lost item and it is subsequently lost or stolen from him, what responsibility does he bear toward the owner? <b>Rabba said:</b> This individual is considered to be <b>like an unpaid bailee. Rav Yosef said:</b> He is <b>like a paid bailee.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that the opinion <b>of Rav Yosef is</b> the subject of a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b> There is no question that Rabba’s opinion is the subject of a dispute between <i>tanna’im</i>, as Rabbi Akiva’s opinion cannot be reconciled with his ruling: If one who takes collateral for his loan is considered a paid bailee, the same certainly applies to one who goes out of his way to safeguard a lost item. The Gemara is asking whether there is any way to explain Rav Yosef’s ruling in accordance with the opinions of both <i>tanna’im</i>, or if he must accept that Rabbi Eliezer disputes his opinion. The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> it is possible <b>with regard to a bailee for a lost item</b> that <b>everyone holds</b> in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rav Yosef,</b> even Rabbi Eliezer. <b>And here,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>,
