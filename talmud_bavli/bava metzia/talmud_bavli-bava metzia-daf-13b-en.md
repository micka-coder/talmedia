### Part 1
the one <b>who says</b> that these <b>matters,</b> the loan, <b>never happened</b> and that the promissory note is forged. Therefore, he has no claim to the paper on which the promissory note is written.

### Part 2
§ <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> in the mishna between Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis is <b>in</b> a case <b>when</b> the purported <b>liable party does not admit</b> to the debt. <b>As, Rabbi Meir holds</b> that <b>with</b> a promissory <b>note that does not include a property guarantee,</b> one <b>can collect</b> a debt <b>neither from liened</b> property that has been sold <b>nor from unsold</b> property. <b>And the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>it is</b> only <b>from liened</b> property <b>that one cannot collect</b> a debt using this promissory note but that one <b>does collect</b> a debt <b>from unsold</b> property. <b>But</b> in a case <b>when</b> the <b>liable party admits</b> to the debt, <b>everyone agrees</b> that the finder <b>must return</b> the promissory note, <b>and we do not suspect</b> the creditor and the debtor of engaging in <b>repayment and collusion [<i>veliknuneya</i>]</b> to the detriment of one who purchased land from the debtor.

### Part 3
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> is in a case <b>when</b> the <b>liable party admits</b> to the debt. <b>As, Rabbi Meir holds</b> that <b>it is</b> only <b>from liened</b> property <b>that one cannot collect</b> a debt using a promissory <b>note that does not include a property guarantee, but</b> one <b>does collect</b> a debt <b>from unsold</b> property. <b>And the Rabbis hold</b> that one <b>collects</b> a debt <b>from liened</b> property <b>too. But</b> in a case <b>when the liable party does not admit</b> to the debt, <b>everyone agrees</b> that the finder <b>may not return</b> the promissory note, <b>as we suspect</b> that perhaps there was <b>repayment.</b>

### Part 4
It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan, and</b> from it there is also <b>a conclusive refutation of one</b> element of the opinion <b>of Rabbi Elazar and a conclusive refutation of two</b> elements of the opinion <b>of Shmuel.</b>

### Part 5
The <i>baraita</i> teaches: In a case where one <b>found promissory notes and they include a property guarantee, even if both</b> the creditor and the debtor <b>agree</b> about the existence of the debt, the finder <b>should not return</b> it <b>to this</b> creditor <b>or to that</b> debtor. If <b>they do not include a property guarantee,</b> then in a case <b>when the debtor admits</b> to the debt, <b>one should return</b> the promissory note to the creditor. But if <b>the debtor does not admit</b> to the debt, <b>one should not return</b> it <b>to this</b> creditor <b>or to that</b> debtor. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>

### Part 6
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>As Rabbi Meir would say:</b> With promissory <b>notes that include a property guarantee, one can collect</b> the debt <b>from liened property; but</b> with those <b>that do not include a property guarantee,</b> one <b>collects</b> the debt only <b>from unsold property. And the Rabbis say:</b> With <b>both this</b> type <b>and that</b> type of promissory note, <b>one can collect</b> the debt <b>from liened property.</b>

### Part 7
This is <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of <b>one</b> element <b>of</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Elazar, who says</b> that <b>according to Rabbi Meir, with</b> a promissory <b>note that does not include a property guarantee</b> one <b>can collect</b> a debt <b>neither from liened</b> property that has been sold <b>nor from unsold</b> property. <b>And</b> Rabbi Elazar also <b>says</b> that <b>according to both Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis, we do not suspect</b> that there is <b>collusion</b> between the debtor and the creditor.

### Part 8
<b>And</b> the <b><i>baraita</i> teaches</b> that with a promissory <b>note that does not include a property guarantee</b> the creditor <b>cannot collect</b> a debt <b>from liened</b> property, <b>but he can collect</b> it <b>from unsold</b> property. <b>And</b> the <i>baraita</i> also <b>teaches</b> that <b>according to</b> the opinions of <b>both Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis, we suspect</b> that there is <b>collusion</b> between the debtor and the creditor, <b>as it is taught</b> that if one found promissory notes that include a property guarantee, <b>even if both</b> the creditor and the debtor <b>agree</b> about the existence of the debt, the finder <b>should not return</b> it <b>to this</b> creditor <b>or to that</b> debtor. <b>Apparently, we suspect collusion.</b> This refutes Rabbi Elazar’s opinion that there is no suspicion of collusion.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>But aren’t these two</b> elements of Rabbi Elazar’s statement that are refuted by the <i>baraita</i>? Why was it stated above that only one element is refuted?
