### Part 1
The accepted depreciation is <b>eight <i>pundeyon</i>,</b> which is a rate of <b>two <i>pundeyon</i> per dinar,</b> or one-sixth of a dinar.

### Part 2
The mishna continues: <b>Until when</b> is it <b>permitted</b> for one <b>to return</b> a worn coin once he realizes that it is defective? <b>In the cities [<i>bakerakim</i>],</b> one may return it only <b>until a period</b> of time has passed <b>that</b> would allow him to <b>show</b> it <b>to a money changer,</b> who is an expert in matters of coins. <b>In the villages,</b> where there is no money changer, one may return it only <b>until Shabbat eves,</b> when people purchase their Shabbat needs. Although these are the limits of how much a coin must be eroded in order for there to be exploitation, <b>if</b> the one who gave the coin to the aggrieved party <b>recognized it, he must accept it</b> back <b>from him even after twelve months</b> have passed no matter how little the erosion affected its value. <b>And he has only a grievance against him,</b> as the Gemara will explain.

### Part 3
<b>And</b> one <b>may give</b> the slightly eroded coin <b>for</b> use in the desacralizing <b>of second-tithe</b> produce <b>and he</b> need <b>not be concerned, as</b> one who would refuse to accept a slightly eroded coin <b>is merely a miserly soul,</b> while the coin is in fact valid for any use.

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> to the mishna from a <i>baraita</i> in which the same measures of depreciation are enumerated, as in that <i>baraita</i> those measures are introduced with the question: <b>How much</b> must <b>the <i>sela</i></b> coin <b>be eroded so</b> that its use in a transaction at its original value <b>will constitute exploitation?</b> That is diametrically opposed to the mishna.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Pappa says:</b> This is <b>not difficult. The <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna <b>calculates</b> the measures <b>from low to high.</b> The <i>tanna</i> says that it does not constitute exploitation up to, but not including, the levels of depreciation enumerated in the mishna. Beginning with those levels of depreciation, it is exploitation. And <b>the external <i>tanna</i>,</b> i.e., the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>calculates from high to low.</b> That <i>tanna</i> says that it is exploitation down to and including the levels of depreciation enumerated in the <i>baraita</i>. It is only beneath those levels that it is not considered exploitation. There is no halakhic dispute between the two <i>tanna’im</i>.

### Part 6
The Gemara returns to discuss the mishna and asks: <b>What is different with regard to a <i>sela</i>, that</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree</b> about the level of depreciation that constitutes exploitation, <b>and what is different with regard to a garment, that</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>do not disagree</b> concerning whether the disparity between value and price that constitutes exploitation is one-sixth or less than one-sixth?

### Part 7
<b>Rava said: Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> that <b>taught</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of exploitation with regard to <b>a garment</b> in the <i>mishnayot</i> cited earlier in this chapter? <b>It is Rabbi Shimon,</b> who maintains that even in the case of a <i>sela</i>, the measure of exploitation is one-sixth. <b>Abaye said</b> that the two cases are different: With regard to <b>a garment, a person</b> is likely <b>to waive</b> the disparity <b>up to one-sixth, as people say: Overpay</b> and acquire an item <b>for your back,</b> i.e., a garment, <b>and</b> acquire <b>at cost</b> items <b>for your stomach,</b> i.e., food. Since it is worth purchasing fine garments, the disparity is not significant. By contrast, with regard to the <b><i>sela</i></b> in question, <b>since it does not circulate, he does not waive</b> even the sum of a smaller disparity.

### Part 8
§ With regard to <b>the</b> matter of exploitation and coins <b>itself,</b> the Gemara elaborates: <b>How much will the <i>sela</i></b> coin <b>be eroded and</b> its use in a transaction <b>will constitute exploitation? Rabbi Meir says: Four <i>issar</i>,</b> which is a rate of <b>an <i>issar</i> per dinar. Rabbi Yehuda says: Four <i>pundeyon</i>, a <i>pundeyon</i> per dinar. Rabbi Shimon says: Eight <i>pundeyon</i>, two <i>pundeyon</i> per dinar.</b> If the depreciation is <b>greater than that, he may sell</b> the coin <b>at its value</b> as metal, not for its original value.

### Part 9
<b>To</b> what <b>extent can the coin erode and it will</b> still <b>be permitted</b> for one <b>to maintain it</b> as a coin? <b>With regard to a <i>sela</i>,</b> it can be used as a <i>sela</i> <b>until</b> it erodes so that its value reaches <b>one shekel,</b> i.e., half a <i>sela</i>. <b>With regard to a dinar,</b> it can be used as a dinar <b>until</b> it erodes so that its value reaches <b>one-quarter.</b> Once it erodes to the point where its value reaches <b>an <i>issar</i> less than that,</b> it is <b>prohibited to spend it. He may not sell</b> the invalidated coin <b>to a merchant, nor to a violent man, nor to a murderer, because they deceive others with it</b> or force them to take it. <b>Rather, he should perforate it and suspend it</b> as an ornament <b>on the neck of his son or the neck of his daughter.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara continues its analysis of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said: With regard to a <i>sela</i>,</b> it can be used as a <i>sela</i> <b>until</b> it erodes so that its value reaches <b>one shekel,</b> i.e., half a <i>sela</i>. <b>With regard to a dinar,</b> it can be used as a dinar <b>until</b> it erodes so that its value reaches <b>one-quarter.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> whereby <b>with regard to a <i>sela</i>,</b> it can be used as a <i>sela</i> <b>until</b> it erodes so that its value reaches <b>one shekel,</b> which is half a <i>sela</i>, <b>and what is different</b> whereby <b>with regard to a dinar,</b> it can be used as a dinar <b>until</b> it erodes so that its value reaches <b>one-quarter [<i>rova</i>]?</b>

### Part 11
<b>Abaye says: What</b> is the meaning of <b><i>rova</i> that</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches?</b> It <b>too</b> is referring to a coin called <i>rova</i>, which is worth <b>one-quarter of a shekel,</b> which is half a dinar. <b>Rava said:</b> The language of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is also precise</b> in this regard, <b>as</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches <i>rova</i> and does not teach one-quarter [<i>revia</i>].</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>Learn from</b> that inference that the reference of the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> is to the coin called <i>rova</i>, which is half a dinar.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> does the <i>tanna</i> state his ruling so that the amount of erosion that disqualifies <b>a dinar is dependent on a shekel?</b> Why does the <i>tanna</i> state the measure as one-quarter of a shekel, rather than stating it as one-half of a dinar? The Gemara explains: By doing so, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us a matter in passing, that there are</b> cases where <b>a dinar originates from a shekel,</b> e.g., a shekel that eroded and is now worth one-half its original value, i.e., one dinar.

### Part 13
This <b>supports</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ami, as Rabbi Ami says:</b> With regard to <b>a dinar that originated from a shekel, it is permitted to maintain it</b> and use it as a dinar. Based on its size and shape, there is no concern that people will confuse it with a shekel. With regard to <b>a dinar that originated from a <i>sela</i>, it is prohibited to maintain it</b> and use it as a dinar. Due to the fact that even after erosion the coin remains the size of a <i>sela</i>, which is clearly larger than a dinar, the concern is that people will mistakenly consider it more valuable than a dinar.

### Part 14
§ The Gemara continues its analysis of the <i>baraita</i>, which teaches: Once it erodes to the point where its value reaches <b>an <i>issar</i> less than that,</b> it is <b>prohibited to spend it.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>saying</b> in that statement? <b>Abaye said</b> that <b>this</b> is what the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying:</b> If <b>a <i>sela</i> eroded</b> by the amount of <b>an <i>issar</i> greater than the measure of exploitation,</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to spend it at its original value. <b>Rava said to</b> Abaye: <b>If so,</b> then <b>even any amount</b> greater than the measure of exploitation should be forbidden <b>as well. Rather, Rava said</b> that this is what the <i>tanna</i> is saying: If <b>a <i>sela</i> eroded</b> by the amount of <b>an <i>issar</i> per dinar,</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to spend it, <b>and</b> this <b>unattributed</b> <i>baraita</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who says in the mishna that the measure of exploitation is one <i>issar</i> per dinar.

### Part 15
<b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Kelim</i> 12:7): <b>A <i>sela</i> that was invalidated</b> for use as a coin, <b>and</b> an individual <b>designated it so that he would weigh with it</b> items that require <b>weighing,</b> is susceptible to becoming <b>ritually impure.</b> His designation rendered it a vessel like any other weight. <b>To</b> what <b>extent can the coin erode and</b> it <b>will</b> still <b>be permitted to maintain it? For a <i>sela</i>,</b> it is an erosion of <b>two dinars,</b> half its value. If it eroded to an extent that it was worth <b>less than that, he must cut</b> it into pieces to prevent its being confused with a proper coin.

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: If it eroded but its current value is <b>greater than</b> one shekel, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rav Huna says:</b> If it eroded and depreciated <b>less than</b> one shekel <b>he must cut</b> it into pieces, and if it eroded and depreciated <b>more than that he must</b> also <b>cut</b> it into pieces. <b>Rabbi Ami says:</b> If it eroded and depreciated <b>less than</b> one shekel <b>he must cut</b> it into pieces, and if it eroded and depreciated <b>more than that he may maintain</b> it, because there is no concern that one will confuse a coin that eroded to that extent with a <i>sela</i>.

### Part 17
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the <i>baraita</i>:
