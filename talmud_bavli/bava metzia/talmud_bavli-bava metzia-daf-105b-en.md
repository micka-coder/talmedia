### Part 1
If a <i>zav</i> and a ritually pure person <b>climbed a tree that has little strength,</b> which shook as they climbed it, <b>or</b> if they climbed onto <b>a branch that has little strength,</b> the ritually pure person is <b>rendered ritually impure.</b> One of the ways a <i>zav</i> imparts impurity is by movement, and here the <i>zav</i> is viewed as having moved the pure person.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this <b>tree that has little strength,</b> i.e., how is a tree with little strength defined? The Sages of <b>the school of Rabbi Yannai say:</b> It is <b>any</b> tree <b>whose trunk is not</b> broad enough <b>that</b> one can <b>hollow out</b> a vessel of <b>a quarter</b>-<i>kav</i> from it. <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>a branch that has little strength? Reish Lakish said:</b> It is <b>any</b> branch concerning <b>which</b> its circumference can <b>be hidden,</b> i.e., inserted, <b>in</b> a person’s <b>fist.</b> A branch of this size is generally not strong enough to hold two people without shaking.

### Part 3
<b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Oholot</i> 18:6): With regard to one <b>who walks in an area in which uncertainty exists concerning the location of a grave or corpse [<i>beit haperas</i>],</b> if he treads <b>over stones that he can move</b> as he walks, raising concerns that he might have moved a bone of a corpse and thereby rendered himself impure, or if he was in that location, <b>on</b> the back of <b>a person or</b> riding <b>on an animal that had little strength,</b> he is <b>impure,</b> as he is considered to have moved the impurity himself.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>a person that has little strength? Reish Lakish said: Any</b> person <b>whose knees knock</b> against each other <b>when</b> someone <b>rides upon him. What are the circumstances</b> of <b>an animal that has little strength?</b> The Sages of <b>the school of Rabbi Yannai say: Any</b> animal <b>that releases excrement</b> due to strain <b>when</b> a person <b>rides upon it.</b>

### Part 5
§ As the Gemara has cited the rulings of the school of Rabbi Yannai with regard to measurements, it now cites similar <i>halakhot</i> that the Sages of <b>the school of Rabbi Yannai state: With regard to prayer and with regard to phylacteries,</b> the measure is <b>four <i>kav</i>.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara inquires: <b>What is</b> the relevance of this measure <b>with regard to prayer?</b> This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who carries a load on his shoulder and the time for prayer arrives,</b> if the load is <b>less than four <i>kav</i>,</b> he <b>lowers it behind him</b> while still holding it <b>and prays,</b> as a light load of this size does not interfere with prayer. If the load is <b>four <i>kav</i>, he places it on the ground and prays.</b>

### Part 7
<b>What is</b> the relevance of this amount <b>with regard to phylacteries?</b> This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a man <b>was carrying a load on his head and</b> he had <b>phylacteries on his head, if the phylacteries were being crushed</b> under the load it is <b>forbidden</b> to leave them on his head, <b>but if</b> they were <b>not</b> being crushed, it is <b>permitted.</b> With regard <b>to which load</b> did the Sages <b>state</b> this <i>halakha</i>? They stated it with regard <b>to a load of four <i>kav</i>.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches:</b> With regard to one <b>who removes garbage</b> by carrying it <b>on his head and</b> has <b>phylacteries on his head, he</b> may <b>not move</b> the phylacteries <b>to the side</b> to prevent them from being crushed, <b>and</b> likewise he may <b>not tie</b> the phylacteries of the head <b>to his loins because he</b> thereby <b>treats them in a manner</b> of <b>degradation. But</b> he may <b>tie them on his arm in the location</b> where <b>the phylacteries</b> of the hand are placed.

### Part 9
The Sages <b>said in the name of the school of Sheila:</b> It is <b>forbidden to place on the head</b> of one <b>that has phylacteries on it even the scarf</b> in which <b>they</b> are wrapped. The Gemara asks: <b>And how much</b> does Rabbi Sheila permit one to place on his head while wearing phylacteries? <b>Abaye said: Even</b> as little as <b>one-quarter of one-quarter</b> of the smallest measurement <b>of Pumbedita</b> is still forbidden from being placed on one’s head.

### Part 10
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: What fixed</b> measure is <b>a pile? Rather,</b> the relevant issue is <b>whether it has</b> a crop <b>equivalent to</b> the measure of seeds for <b>dropping</b> in a field in order to sow it. The Gemara asks: <b>And how much</b> is <b>equivalent to </b>the measure of seeds for <b>dropping</b> in a field in order to sow it? <b>Rabbi Ami says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> says: <b>Four <i>se’a</i> for</b> the amount of land sufficient to grow <b>a <i>kor</i>. Rabbi Ami himself,</b> though, <b>says eight <i>se’a</i> for</b> the amount of land sufficient to grow <b>a <i>kor</i>. A certain elder said to Rav Ḥama, son of Rabba bar Avuh: I will explain it to you: In the years of Rabbi Yoḥanan the land was fat,</b> while <b>in the years of Rabbi Ami the land was lean,</b> and it was therefore necessary to double the amount of seed for each unit of land.

### Part 11
<b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Pe’a</i> 5:1): If <b>the wind scattered the</b> standing <b>sheaves</b> so that it is no longer known which gleanings fell from the sheaves during the harvest and belong to the poor, one <b>evaluates how many gleanings</b> it was <b>fit to produce, and</b> he <b>gives</b> these <b>to the poor. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: He gives to the poor</b> the amount <b>equivalent to </b>the measure of seeds <b>dropping</b> in the course of harvesting.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>And how much</b> is the amount <b>equivalent to</b> the measure of seeds <b>dropping </b>in the course of harvesting? <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael <b>he said</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar</b> said, <b>and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan: Four <i>kav</i> for a <i>kor</i>. Rabbi Yirmeya raised a dilemma:</b> Does this mean <b>for a</b> field that requires a <b><i>kor</i> of seed</b> to plant it, <b>or for a <i>kor</i> of produce?</b> And if it is the former, does it refer <b>to sowing</b> by <b>hand or to sowing</b> by <b>oxen?</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael <b>he</b> said that <b>Rabbi Avuh said</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar said, and some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Four <i>kav</i> for a</b> field sown with a <b><i>kor</i> of seed.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> the other question should <b>still raise a dilemma for you:</b> Does this refer <b>to sowing</b> by <b>hand or to sowing</b> by <b>oxen?</b> No answer was found for this question, and the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 14
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who receives a field from another</b> to cultivate <b>and grasshoppers consumed it or</b> it <b>was wind blasted, if it is a regional disaster</b> which affected all the fields in the area, the cultivator <b>subtracts from</b> the produce <b>he</b> owes as part of <b>his tenancy. If it</b> is <b>not a regional disaster,</b> the cultivator does <b>not subtract from</b> the produce <b>he</b> owes as part of <b>his tenancy. Rabbi Yehuda says: If</b> the cultivator <b>received it from</b> the owner <b>for</b> a fixed sum of <b>money, whether this</b> way, i.e., there is a regional disaster, or <b>whether that</b> way, i.e., there was no regional disaster, <b>he does not subtract</b> the produce he owes as part of <b>his tenancy.</b>

### Part 15
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>a regional disaster? Rav Yehuda said:</b> If, <b>for example, most of</b> that <b>valley</b> in which the field was located <b>was wind blasted,</b> it is considered a regional disaster. <b>Ulla said:</b> If, <b>for example, four fields were wind blasted on its four sides,</b> it is considered a regional disaster.

### Part 16
<b>Ulla</b> also <b>said: They raise</b> the following <b>dilemma in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael: If <b>one furrow was wind blasted along its entire length,</b> adjacent to other fields that were wind blasted, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Is this considered to be part of the regional disaster? Conversely, if <b>one furrow remained</b> undamaged <b>along its entire length, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does the remaining furrow mean that the entire field is not considered to be part of the regional disaster? If <b>a fallow</b> field <b>divided</b> between the cultivated fields and the fields that were wind blasted, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Alternatively, if there was a field of <b>fodder</b> between this field and the others that were wind blasted,
