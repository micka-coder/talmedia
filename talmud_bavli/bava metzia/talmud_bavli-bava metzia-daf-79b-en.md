### Part 1
<b>Let</b> the owner <b>say to him: Give me that wine and I will bring a boat.</b> Since that particular wine is gone, the renter cannot comply with his request, and therefore he should have to pay the rental fee.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Pappa said: You find</b> the correct application of Rabbi Natan’s ruling <b>only in</b> a case where the two parties stipulated <b>this</b> specific <b>boat and that</b> specific <b>wine.</b> Since neither party can fulfill his part of the agreement, the money remains where it is. <b>But</b> if they stipulated <b>an unspecified boat and unspecified wine,</b> as they can both complete the agreement, <b>they divide</b> the rental fee, i.e., the renter pays half.

### Part 3
<b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to <b>one who rents a boat and unloads it [<i>uferakah</i>] halfway through the journey,</b> the renter <b>gives</b> the owner <b>his</b> rental <b>fee for half the journey, and</b> the owner of the boat <b>has nothing but a grievance against him.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances? If we say that</b> this is referring to a situation where the owner <b>can find</b> someone else <b>to</b> whom he can <b>rent out</b> the boat, <b>why does he have</b> grounds for <b>a grievance? And if it</b> is referring to a case <b>where he cannot find</b> another <b>to</b> whom he can <b>rent it out,</b> the renter <b>should be required to pay the full</b> rental <b>fee,</b> as he reneged on his commitment to rent the boat for the entire trip.

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> this is referring to a case <b>where</b> the owner <b>can find</b> someone else <b>to</b> whom he can <b>rent out</b> the boat. <b>But why does he have</b> cause for a <b>grievance? Because of the wear and tear on the boat</b> due to the additional loading and unloading of cargo, which was not taken into account in their agreement. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, that is a proper</b> legal <b>claim, and</b> the owner of the boat <b>has</b> not merely a grievance against the renter, but cause for claiming <b>monetary restitution from him.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rather, what is</b> the meaning of the term <b><i>perakah</i>?</b> This means <b>that</b> the renter <b>unloaded</b> more of <b>his own cargo into</b> the boat halfway through the journey. Accordingly, the <i>baraita</i> is ruling that the renter must pay a fee for the additional cargo only for the second half of the journey. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>what is</b> the <b>grievance?</b> Why should the owner object to this arrangement at all? The Gemara explains that the grievance is <b>due to the change from</b> the renter’s prior <b>intention,</b> as they had not agreed upon the addition of this additional cargo when they performed the transaction. <b>Alternatively,</b> the grievance is because <b>of the extra rope</b> that was necessary to secure the additional cargo.

### Part 6
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who rents a donkey to ride on it,</b> the <b>renter</b> may <b>place on it his garment, his water jug, and food for that journey. Beyond those</b> items, the <b>donkey driver,</b> who would take the renter on the journey, may <b>prevent him</b> from placing anything on the animal by saying that he does not wish to further burden the donkey. The <b>donkey driver</b> may <b>place on it barley and hay</b> for the donkey <b>and his own food for that</b> first <b>day</b> alone. <b>Beyond those</b> items, the <b>renter</b> may <b>prevent him</b> from placing anything on the animal.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances? If</b> this is referring to a situation <b>where</b> food <b>is available for purchase, the donkey driver</b> should <b>also</b> be able <b>to prevent</b> the renter from bringing food for the entire journey, <b>and if</b> it is a case <b>where</b> food <b>is not available for purchase,</b> the <b>renter</b> should <b>also not</b> be able <b>to prevent</b> the donkey driver from loading on the donkey his own food for the entire journey.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Pappa said: No,</b> the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> is <b>necessary</b> in a situation <b>where</b> food <b>is available</b> for one who <b>goes to the trouble to purchase</b> it <b>from</b> one <b>station [<i>me’avna</i>] to</b> the next <b>station.</b> Since it is <b>the manner of a donkey driver to go to</b> the <b>trouble to purchase</b> food, he may load the animal only with food for that day, whereas it is <b>not the manner of</b> the <b>renter to go to the trouble to purchase</b> food, and therefore he may take food with him for the entire journey.

### Part 9
<b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to <b>one who rents a donkey with</b> the understanding that <b>a man will ride upon it, a woman may not ride upon it.</b> If he rented it <b>with</b> the understanding that <b>a woman</b> will ride upon it, <b>a man</b> may <b>ride upon it. And</b> if he rented it <b>with</b> the understanding that <b>a woman</b> will ride upon it, any female may ride upon it, <b>whether</b> she is <b>an adult woman or a minor girl.</b> And <b>even a pregnant</b> woman, despite her additional weight, <b>and even a nursing woman</b> who takes the child with her may ride upon it.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>Now</b> that <b>you said</b> that the owner cannot prevent even <b>a nursing woman</b> from riding upon the donkey, despite the fact that this involves the weight of two people, <b>is it necessary</b> to say that <b>a pregnant woman</b> may ride upon the donkey? <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> The <i>tanna</i> <b>spoke</b> of <b>a pregnant woman who is</b> also <b>nursing,</b> as there is additional weight.

### Part 11
<b>Abaye said: You</b> can <b>learn from</b> the fact that a pregnant woman is considered heavier than the average woman <b>that the weight of a fish [<i>binita</i>] is in its belly,</b> i.e., weight increases according to the size of its belly. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the</b> practical <b>difference</b> resulting from Abaye’s statement with regard to a fish? The Gemara explains: It is <b>with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>buying and selling,</b> so that one can know how to evaluate the weight of a fish, and calculate its value accordingly.
