### Part 1
<b>And if</b> he rides <b>it</b> in <b>the public domain, he acquires</b> it, as people commonly ride animals in the city’s public domain. <b>And if he is an important person,</b> who always rides his animal rather than leading it, <b>he acquires</b> it even in an alleyway. <b>And if</b> the buyer <b>is a woman, she acquires</b> the animal, as women do not normally lead animals. <b>And if</b> the buyer <b>is a detestable person,</b> who rides even where other people do not, he too <b>acquires</b> the animal.

### Part 2
§ <b>Rabbi Elazar raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>one who says to another,</b> to whom he wishes to sell vessels: <b>Pull this animal in order</b> to <b>acquire</b> the <b>vessels that are upon it, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Can the buyer acquire the vessels by pulling the animal?

### Part 3
Before discussing the dilemma, the Gemara clarifies the issue. If the vendor merely says: <b>In order</b> that you will <b>acquire</b> the vessels, how can the buyer acquire them? <b>Did he say to him</b> in the imperative: <b>Acquire</b> the vessels? Without the seller’s explicitly instructing the buyer to acquire the vessels, the buyer cannot acquire them. <b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Elazar’s dilemma is with regard to a case where the seller says to the buyer: <b>Pull this animal and</b> thereby <b>acquire</b> the <b>vessels that are</b> upon it. <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Is pulling the animal effective</b> in order <b>to acquire</b> the <b>vessels</b> upon it, <b>or not?</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rava said:</b> It is clearly not effective, as even <b>if he said to him: Acquire</b> the <b>animal and acquire</b> the <b>vessels, does</b> the buyer <b>acquire</b> the <b>vessels?</b> Although one can acquire an item by having it placed in his courtyard, and one’s animal is the equivalent of his courtyard, <b>it is</b> considered <b>a mobile courtyard, and a mobile courtyard does not effect acquisition</b> of items that are placed in it.

### Part 5
<b>And if you would say</b> that the animal can function as a courtyard <b>when</b> it is <b>standing</b> still, not walking, while being pulled, <b>isn’t</b> there a principle which states that <b>anything that does not effect acquisition when moving</b> also <b>does not effect acquisition</b> when it is <b>standing or sitting?</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that the buyer can acquire vessels by having them placed on the animal’s back only <b>when</b> the animal is <b>bound.</b> In that circumstance, when the buyer acquires the animal it assumes the legal status of his courtyard, and he also acquires the items that are placed upon the animal.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Pappa and Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said to Rava: If that is so,</b> in a case where one <b>was sailing on a boat and fish jumped and fell into the boat, is</b> the boat <b>also</b> considered <b>a mobile courtyard, and</b> therefore <b>he does not acquire</b> the fish? Rava <b>said to</b> them: A boat is not considered a mobile courtyard, as the <b>boat</b> itself <b>sits idle, and it is the water that moves it.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: If that is so,</b> that one does not acquire items that are placed in his mobile courtyard, then if a woman <b>was walking in the public domain and</b> her husband <b>threw a bill of divorce into her lap,</b> i.e., onto her person, <b>or into her basket</b> that she was carrying on her head, <b>here too, is she not divorced</b> because the basket was moving? Rav Ashi <b>said to him: Her basket</b> is not considered a mobile courtyard, as it <b>sits idle, and it is she who walks beneath it.</b>

### Part 9
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one <b>was riding on an animal and saw a found item, and said to another</b> person who was walking beside him: <b>Give</b> it <b>to me,</b> if the pedestrian <b>took it and said: I have acquired it</b> for myself, <b>he has acquired it</b> by means of lifting it, even though he did not see it first. But <b>if, after giving it to</b> the one riding the animal, <b>he said: I acquired it</b> for myself <b>at the outset, he has said nothing</b> and the rider keeps the item.

### Part 10
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Pe’a</i> 4:9): With regard to <b>one who gleaned the produce in the corner of the field, which is given to the poor [<i>pe’a</i>], and said: This</b> produce <b>is for so-and-so, a poor person, Rabbi Eliezer says: He</b> thereby <b>acquired</b> it <b>on</b> the poor person’s <b>behalf. And the Rabbis say:</b> He did not acquire it for the poor person; rather, <b>he should give it to the first poor person that he encounters.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Ulla said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b> This <b>dispute</b> is in a case where the <i>pe’a</i> was gleaned <b>by a rich person,</b> who is not entitled to take the <i>pe’a</i> for himself, <b>on behalf of a poor person.</b>

### Part 12
<b>As Rabbi Eliezer holds</b> that <b>since [<i>miggo</i>], if he</b> so <b>desires, he can renounce ownership of his property and</b> he would then <b>be poor, and</b> the <i>pe’a</i> would then be <b>suitable for him, now too,</b> it is considered potentially <b>suitable for him</b> even though he is wealthy. <b>And since [<i>miggo</i>] he can acquire</b> it <b>for himself, he can acquire</b> it <b>on behalf of another</b> poor person <b>as well. And the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>we say <i>miggo</i> once,</b> but <b>we do not say <i>miggo</i> twice.</b> Therefore, a wealthy person cannot acquire <i>pe’a</i> for a poor person.

### Part 13
<b>But</b> in a case where the <i>pe’a</i> was gleaned <b>by a poor person on behalf of</b> another <b>poor person, everyone agrees</b> that <b>he acquires</b> it <b>on behalf of</b> the other person, <b>as since [<i>miggo</i>] he can acquire</b> it <b>for himself, he can acquire</b> it <b>on behalf of another</b> person <b>as well.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Rav Naḥman said to Ulla: But shouldn’t the Master say</b> that the <b>dispute</b> is even in a case where the <i>pe’a</i> was gleaned <b>by a poor person on behalf of</b> another <b>poor person?</b> This can be proven from the mishna, <b>as everyone is</b> considered like <b>poor people with regard to a found item,</b> i.e., everyone has the right to acquire a found item just as a poor person is entitled to glean <i>pe’a</i>, <b>and we learned</b> in the mishna: If one <b>was riding on an animal and saw a found item, and said to another</b> person: <b>Give</b> it <b>to me,</b> if the pedestrian <b>took it and said: I have acquired it</b> for myself, <b>he has acquired it.</b>

### Part 15
<b>Granted, if you say</b> the <b>dispute</b> pertains to a case where the <i>pe’a</i> was gleaned <b>by a poor person on behalf of a poor person,</b>
