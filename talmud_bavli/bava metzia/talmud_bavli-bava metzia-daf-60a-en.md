### Part 1
<b>And needless to say,</b> one may not intermingle <b>new</b> produce <b>with old</b> produce, in the event that the old produce is superior, as with grains, since intermingling lowers its value.

### Part 2
<b>Actually, they said: With regard to wine, they permitted one to mix strong</b> wine <b>with weak</b> wine, <b>because one</b> thereby <b>enhances it. One may not</b> intentionally <b>mix wine sediment with the wine, but one may give</b> the buyer wine with <b>its sediment;</b> the seller is not required to filter the wine.

### Part 3
<b>One who</b> had <b>water mix with his wine may not sell it in the store, unless he informs</b> the buyer that it contains water. <b>And he may not</b> sell it <b>to a merchant, even if he informs him</b> of the mixture, <b>as,</b> although he is aware that there is water mixed with the wine, <b>it</b> will be used <b>for nothing other than deceit</b> because the merchant will likely not inform the buyer that it is diluted. In <b>a place where they are accustomed to place water into the wine</b> to dilute it and everyone is aware of that fact, <b>one may place</b> water in the wine.

### Part 4
The prohibition against mixing different types of produce applies only to an individual selling the produce of his field. By contrast, <b>a merchant may take</b> grain <b>from five threshing floors</b> belonging to different people, <b>and place</b> the produce <b>in one warehouse.</b> He may also take wine <b>from five winepresses and place</b> the wine <b>in one large cask [<i>pitom</i>], provided that he does not intend to mix</b> low-quality merchandise with high-quality merchandise.

### Part 5
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught: Needless to say,</b> if the price of the <b>new</b> produce is <b>four</b> <i>se’a</i> for a <i>sela</i> <b>and</b> the price of the <b>old</b> produce is <b>three</b> <i>se’a</i> for a <i>sela</i>, <b>one may not intermingle</b> them together. That is full-fledged deceit, as one is selling inexpensive produce at the price of expensive produce. <b>Rather, even</b> if the price of the <b>new</b> produce is <b>three</b> <i>se’a</i> for a <i>sela</i> <b>and</b> the price of the <b>old</b> produce is <b>four</b> <i>se’a</i> for a <i>sela</i>, <b>one may not intermingle</b> them. This is <b>because</b> in this case the price of the new produce is higher, as <b>people want to age</b> the produce, i.e., new produce is more valuable to those who seek to place it in storage for a lengthy period, although it may be of inferior quality compared to old produce.

### Part 6
The mishna teaches: <b>Actually, they said: With regard to wine, they permitted one to mix strong</b> wine <b>with weak</b> wine <b>because</b> mixing the wine <b>enhances it. Rabbi Elazar said: That is to say, every</b> time a <i>halakha</i> is introduced with the phrase: <b>Actually they said,</b> it <b>is</b> an established <b><i>halakha</i></b> with regard to which there is no uncertainty.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Naḥman says: And</b> it is with regard to the period when the wine is <b>among the winepresses,</b> i.e., before the wine ferments, that <b>they taught</b> this <i>halakha</i>. When the wine is still in the process of fermentation, if different wines are mixed and ferment together, this enhances their flavor. By contrast, if they are mixed at a later stage, this will harm their flavor.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>And today, when</b> people <b>mix</b> old and new wine even when the wine is <b>not among the winepresses,</b> on what basis is mixing permitted? <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> It is <b>because</b> buyers <b>are aware</b> of the potential loss <b>and waive</b> it. <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, said:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? <b>It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Aḥa, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Aḥa permits</b> mixing <b>in</b> a case where the product <b>will be tasted</b> before its purchase. Then there is no deceit, as when the buyer tastes it, he is immediately aware that it is a mixture, and the choice of whether or not to purchase the product is his.

### Part 9
The mishna teaches: <b>And one may not</b> intentionally <b>mix wine sediment with the wine, but one may give</b> the buyer wine with <b>its sediment.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t you say in the former clause</b> of the mishna that <b>one may not mix sediment at all? And lest you say: What is</b> the meaning of: <b>He may give</b> the buyer wine with <b>its sediment;</b> it means <b>that he informs</b> the buyer that the wine contains sediment, this suggestion is not tenable. <b>From</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause teaches: One may not sell it in the store unless he informs</b> the buyer <b>and</b> he <b>may not</b> sell it <b>to a merchant even if he informs him, it may be inferred that the former clause</b> is speaking of a situation where one may sell it in the store <b>even if he does not inform</b> the buyer.

### Part 10
<b>Rav Yehuda said: This</b> is what the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying: One may neither mix sediment</b> remaining <b>from</b> wine that he poured <b>the night before with</b> the wine <b>of</b> the next <b>day, nor</b> the sediment <b>of</b> the next <b>day with</b> the wine <b>of the night before. But he may give</b> the buyer <b>sediment of</b> that wine <b>itself. That is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> With regard to <b>one who pours wine for another,</b> attempting to pour the liquid while leaving the sediment in the cask, that person <b>may neither mix</b> sediment remaining <b>from</b> wine that he poured <b>the night before with</b> the wine <b>of</b> the next <b>day, nor</b> the sediment <b>of</b> the next <b>day with</b> the wine <b>of the night before. But he may mix</b> the sediment <b>of the night before with</b> the wine poured <b>the night before, and</b> the sediment <b>of</b> the next <b>day with</b> the wine <b>of</b> the next <b>day.</b>

### Part 11
The mishna teaches: <b>One who</b> had <b>water mix with his wine may not sell it in the store, unless he informs</b> the buyer that it contains water. The Gemara relates: <b>They brought wine to Rava from a store. He diluted it</b> with water, <b>tasted it, and it was not tasty. He sent it</b> back <b>to the store,</b> so they could sell it there. <b>Abaye said to him: But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>And he may not</b> sell it <b>to a merchant, even if he informs him?</b> Rava <b>said to him: My dilution</b> of the wine <b>is evident</b> to all, as I add more water than is typically added. <b>And lest you say</b> that the storekeeper <b>will add wine, and sweeten</b> the mixture, <b>and sell it</b> again, when the dilution is no longer evident, <b>if</b> this is a concern, <b>there is no end to the matter.</b> It should be prohibited to sell any wine to a merchant due to the concern lest he engage in deceit in its resale.

### Part 12
The mishna teaches: In <b>a place where they are accustomed to place water into the wine</b> to dilute it and everyone is aware of that fact, <b>one may place</b> water in the wine. <b>It was taught:</b> One may dilute the wine by adding water that will constitute <b>one-half, one-third, or one-fourth</b> of the mixture, in accordance with the local custom. <b>Rav says: And</b> it is with regard to the period when the wine is <b>among the winepresses,</b> before the wine ferments, that <b>they taught</b> this <i>halakha</i>. If wine is diluted at a later stage, the dilution will cause the wine to spoil.

### Part 13
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: A storekeeper may not hand out toasted grain and nuts to children</b> who patronize his store, <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that he</b> thereby <b>accustoms them to come to him</b> at the expense of competing storekeepers. <b>And the Rabbis permit</b> doing so. <b>And one may not reduce</b> the price of sale items below <b>the</b> market <b>rate. And the Rabbis say:</b> If he wishes to do so, he should be <b>remembered positively.</b>

### Part 14
One <b>may not sift ground beans</b> to remove the waste, lest he charge an inappropriately high price for the sifted meal, beyond its actual value; this is <b>the statement of Abba Shaul. And the Rabbis permit</b> doing so. <b>And</b> the Rabbis <b>concede that one may not sift</b> the meal only <b>from</b> the beans that are close to <b>the opening of the bin</b> to create the impression that the contents of the entire bin were sifted, <b>as this is nothing other than deception. One may neither adorn a person</b> before selling him on the slave market, <b>nor an animal nor vessels</b> that he seeks to sell. Rather, they must be sold unembellished, to avoid deceiving the buyer.

### Part 15
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason for the</b> opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who permit the free distribution of toasted grain and nuts? It is <b>because</b> the storekeeper can <b>say to his</b> competitors: <b>I hand out nuts; and you hand out jujubes [<i>shiskei</i>].</b> All merchants are able to hand out goods that will attract children, and consequently this is not unfair competition.

### Part 16
The mishna teaches: <b>And one may not reduce</b> the price of items below <b>the</b> market <b>rate. And the Rabbis say:</b> If he wishes to do so, he should be <b>remembered positively.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason for the</b> opinion of the <b>Rabbis,</b> who not only condone the practice but even praise the person, saying that he should be remembered positively?
