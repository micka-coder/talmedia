### Part 1
<b>But here,</b> where he says: On the condition that you have no claim of exploitation against me, <b>does</b> the other party <b>know</b> that there will be exploitation so <b>that</b> he will consciously <b>waive</b> his rights to claim compensation in the event that there is? He believes that perhaps there will be no exploitation at all.

### Part 2
<b>And Shmuel says: I state</b> my opinion <b>even in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> as <b>Rabbi Meir states</b> his opinion <b>only there,</b> in the case of betrothal, <b>where</b> the husband <b>definitely abrogates</b> Torah law with his condition. <b>But here, who says</b> that either party to the sale <b>will abrogate any</b> Torah law?

### Part 3
<b>Rav Anan says:</b> This matter <b>was explained to me personally by Mar Shmuel.</b> In the case of <b>one who says to another:</b> I will be party to this sale <b>on the condition that you have no</b> claim of <b>exploitation against me,</b> the other party <b>does not have</b> a claim of <b>exploitation against him,</b> as one can waive his rights to compensation for the exploitation that he suffered. But if one said: I will be party to this sale <b>on the condition that it</b> is <b>not</b> subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>exploitation, it is</b> subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>exploitation,</b> as in this case it is directly counter to Torah law.

### Part 4
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who conducts business on faith; and</b> in the case of <b>one who says to another:</b> I will be party to this sale <b>on the condition that you have no</b> claim of <b>exploitation against me,</b> the exploited party <b>does not have</b> a claim of <b>exploitation against</b> the one who exploited him. <b>According to Rav, who said: I stated</b> my opinion <b>even in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i>, as pursuant to that statement, even Rabbi Yehuda holds that in cases of exploitation one cannot stipulate counter to that which is written in the Torah?

### Part 5
<b>Abaye said:</b> Based on this proof from the <i>baraita</i> it is <b>clear</b> that <b>Rav stated</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, and that Shmuel stated</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> and this <i>baraita</i> expresses the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda.

### Part 6
<b>Rava said:</b> It is <b>not difficult,</b> as there is a distinction between the cases. <b>Here,</b> in this <i>baraita</i>, the <i>tanna</i> is speaking <b>in</b> a case where the condition is stated in <b>an ordinary</b> case, where it is not stated explicitly that the price paid is not the market value. In that case, Rav says that Rabbi Yehuda holds that the condition is void. <b>There,</b> where Rabbi Yehuda would uphold the condition, the <i>tanna</i> is speaking <b>in</b> a case where the exploitation is <b>explicit,</b> i.e., both parties know that the price paid is not the market value.

### Part 7
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is <b>in an ordinary</b> case, <b>but in</b> a case where the exploitation is <b>explicit,</b> e.g., in the case of <b>a seller who said to the buyer:</b> Concerning <b>this item that I am selling to you for two hundred</b> dinars, <b>I know about it that it is worth only one hundred dinars,</b> and I am selling it <b>on the condition that you have no</b> claim of <b>exploitation against me,</b> the buyer <b>has no</b> claim of <b>exploitation against him. And likewise,</b> in the case of <b>a buyer who said to the seller:</b> Concerning <b>this item that I am buying from you for one hundred dinars, I know about it that it is worth two hundred</b> dinars, and I am buying it <b>on the condition that you have no</b> claim of <b>exploitation against me,</b> the seller <b>has no</b> claim of <b>exploitation against him.</b>

### Part 8
Apropos the mention of one who conducts business on faith, the Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> that teaches several <i>halakhot</i> concerning such an arrangement. <b>The Sages taught:</b> When selling merchandise that one purchased in bulk, <b>one who conducts business on faith may not calculate</b> the price of <b>the</b> merchandise of <b>inferior</b> quality <b>on faith and</b> the price of <b>the</b> merchandise of <b>superior</b> quality <b>at</b> their market <b>value. Rather,</b> he has two options: <b>Either</b> the price of both <b>this</b> merchandise <b>and that</b> merchandise must be calculated <b>on faith, or</b> the price of both <b>this</b> merchandise <b>and that</b> merchandise must be calculated <b>at</b> their market <b>value.</b>

### Part 9
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> the buyer <b>gives</b> the seller <b>the payment</b> for the money he spent in hiring <b>a porter, the payment</b> for the money he spent in hiring <b>a camel driver</b> if necessary, and <b>the payment</b> for the <b>lodgings</b> he used during the time of the transaction. These expenses had been borne by the seller, so it is not exploitation if he recovers them by charging the buyer. But as for the sellerâ€™s <b>own wages,</b> i.e., payment for the time he spent engaging in the transaction, <b>he does not take</b> his own wages, <b>as</b> the one from whom he purchased the merchandise <b>already gave him his full wages.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>his wages in full, from where did he give</b> that to <b>him?</b> With what was he paid by the one from whom he purchased the merchandise? The Gemara responds: <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> This is referring <b>to sellers of inexpensive garments, where</b> the one from whom he purchases the merchandise <b>gives four</b> additional units <b>for</b> each <b>one hundred</b> units purchased, and that functions as payment for his efforts.

### Part 11
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>How much can the <i>sela</i></b> coin <b>be eroded</b> through usage, <b>and</b> its use in a transaction at its original value <b>will</b> still <b>not constitute exploitation? Rabbi Meir says:</b> The accepted depreciation is <b>four <i>issar</i>,</b> which is a rate of one <b><i>issar</i> per dinar,</b> or one twenty-fourth of a dinar. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The accepted depreciation is <b>four <i>pundeyon</i>,</b> which is a rate of one <b><i>pundeyon</i> per dinar,</b> or one-twelfth of a dinar. <b>And Rabbi Shimon says:</b>
