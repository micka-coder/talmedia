### Part 1
<b>But according to Rava’s</b> opinion, that association with an oath is not considered an oath, the <i>baraita</i> poses <b>a difficulty,</b> as it indicates that association with a vow is considered a vow; a corresponding rule should apply to an oath.

### Part 2
The Gemara answers: <b>Rava</b> could <b>say to you: Resolve</b> the difficulty posed by the <i>baraita</i> <b>and say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> teaches <b>this: Which is the bond</b> of <b>a vow mentioned in the Torah?</b> When is a bond, i.e., the acceptance of a prohibition on oneself, considered a vow? According to Rava, “bond” in the verse is not referring to association. Rather, it is referring to <b>one who says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me that I will not eat meat and that I will not drink wine like</b> on <b>the day that his,</b> i.e., my, <b>father died,</b> or: <b>Like</b> on <b>the day that so-and-so was killed. And Shmuel says:</b> This <b>is</b> the <i>halakha</i> only <b>when he is prohibited</b> from eating meat and drinking wine <b>by vow since that day,</b> e.g., the day his father died.

### Part 3
<b>What is the reason</b> for Shmuel’s caveat? <b>The verse states: “When a man vows a vow to the Lord”</b> (Numbers 30:3). The redundancy in the phrase “vows a vow” teaches that when one associates a vow with another prohibition, it does not take effect <b>unless he vows by</b> associating it with <b>an item</b> forbidden <b>by</b> means of <b>a vow.</b> Association is derived from this verse and is limited to vows.

### Part 4
The Gemara discusses the <i>baraita</i>: One who says: It is incumbent upon me that I will not eat meat and that I will not drink wine <b>like</b> on <b>the day that his father died.</b> The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that he is prohibited from eating meat and drinking wine? Why does the <i>baraita</i> need to mention the specific example of a vow concerning the day his father died? The Gemara answers: It <b>was necessary</b> that the <i>baraita</i> state that the vow takes effect for the sake of the other example: <b>Like</b> on <b>the day that Gedaliah ben Ahikam was killed.</b> Otherwise, it <b>may enter your mind to say: Since,</b> even <b>if he did not vow</b> to refrain from eating meat or drinking wine on that day <b>they would be prohibited to him anyway,</b> as it is a public fast day, <b>when he did vow</b> to refrain from eating and drinking on that day, the <b>prohibition</b> of the vow <b>would not take effect on him, and that</b> subsequent vow would then <b>not be associated with a vow,</b> but with an ordinary prohibition. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that the vow made on the fast day takes effect and the second vow can be associated with it.

### Part 5
The Gemara comments: <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan also holds in accordance with this</b> opinion <b>of Rava</b> that a bond is not an association with an oath, but an oath itself, <b>as when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia he reported that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If one says: By my <b>clear utterance I will not eat of yours,</b> or: On my <b>bond I will not eat of yours,</b> it is <b>an oath.</b>

### Part 6
§ <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael, he reported that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If one takes an oath, saying: <b>I will eat, or: I will not eat,</b> relating to the future, and does not fulfill it, it is <b>a false</b> oath. <b>And its prohibition</b> in the Torah is <b>from here:</b> “And <b>you shall not take an oath by My name falsely,</b> so that you profane the name of your God; I am the Lord” (Leviticus 19:12). If one takes an oath, saying: <b>I ate, or: I did not eat,</b> relating to past actions, and it is a lie, it is an oath taken <b>in vain, and its prohibition</b> in the Torah is <b>from here: “You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain;</b> for the Lord will not absolve of guilt he that takes His name in vain” (Exodus 20:7).

### Part 7
Rav Dimi continued: With regard to vows where one states that an item is forbidden <b>like an offering [<i>konamot</i>],</b> if he subsequently derives benefit from that item, one <b>violates</b> the prohibition: “When a man vows a vow to the Lord, or takes an oath to bind his soul with a bond, <b>he shall not break his word;</b> he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth” (Numbers 30:3).

### Part 8
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: The prohibitions against taking an oath <b>in vain and</b> taking <b>a false</b> oath <b>are one.</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>What, is</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>not</b> teaching <b>that</b> if an oath taken <b>in vain</b> refers <b>to the past, a false</b> oath <b>also</b> refers <b>to the past? Apparently,</b> the statements: <b>I ate,</b> and: <b>I did not eat, are</b> both <b>false</b> oaths, contrary to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement that a false oath is one that relates to the future.

### Part 9
The Gemara answers: <b>Are the cases comparable? This</b> case, of a false oath, is <b>as it is and that</b> case, of an oath taken in vain, is <b>as it is. What,</b> then, is the meaning of the assertion of the <i>baraita</i> that <b>they are one?</b> It is <b>that</b> both <b>were spoken in a single utterance</b> at the giving of the Torah, <b>like that</b> which <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Remember</b> the Sabbath day, to keep it holy” (Exodus 20:8), <b>and: “Observe</b> the Sabbath day, to keep it holy” (Deuteronomy 5:12), <b>were spoken in one utterance,</b> in a manner <b>that the</b> human <b>mouth cannot say and that the</b> human <b>ear cannot hear.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, there,</b> “remember” and “observe” <b>were spoken in a single utterance</b> in order to teach the <i>halakha</i> <b>that Rav Adda bar Ahava</b> says; <b>as Rav Adda bar Ahava says: Women are obligated to</b> recite <b><i>kiddush</i></b> sanctifying <b>the</b> seventh <b>day, by Torah law,</b> even though it is a positive, time-bound mitzva, <b>since the verses state: “Remember,” and: “Observe,”</b> indicating that <b>anyone who is</b> obligated <b>to observe,</b> i.e., is prohibited from performing labor on Shabbat, <b>is</b> obligated <b>to remember,</b> by reciting <i>kiddush</i>. <b>And these women, since they are</b> obligated <b>to observe, they also are</b> obligated <b>to remember. But here,</b> with regard to the prohibitions against taking a false oath and taking an oath in vain, <b>for what <i>halakha</i> is it necessary</b> for them to have been spoken in a single utterance?

### Part 11
The Gemara explains: <b>Rather,</b> the two prohibitions were spoken together to teach that <b>just as</b> one <b>is flogged for</b> taking an oath <b>in vain, so</b> is one <b>also flogged for</b> taking <b>a false</b> oath.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t it the opposite [<i>kelapei layya</i>]?</b> It is clear that one receives lashes for taking a false oath about the future, which one violates with an action, but an oath taken in vain about the past is merely a verbal pronouncement. <b>Rather, say</b> like this: <b>Just as</b> one <b>is flogged for</b> taking a <b>false</b> oath, i.e., violating one’s oath about the future, <b>so</b> is one <b>also flogged for</b> taking an oath <b>in vain.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: Why must the <i>baraita</i> state that one is flogged for either type of oath? Isn’t it <b>obvious? This is a prohibition and that is a prohibition,</b> and for both one is liable to receive lashes. The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say as Rav Pappa said to Abaye,</b> that the verse: “For the Lord <b>will not absolve of guilt</b> he that takes His name in vain” (Exodus 20:7), might indicate that God will not absolve him <b>at all,</b> and even if he is punished he cannot atone for his sin,
