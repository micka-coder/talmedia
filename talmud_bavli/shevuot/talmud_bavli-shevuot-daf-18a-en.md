### Part 1
<b>And if</b> we say that we are dealing <b>with an <i>am ha’aretz</i>,</b> an ignoramus, who does not know that it is prohibited for him to engage in intercourse with a woman near the expected onset of her menstruation, and who also does not know that it is prohibited for him to immediately withdraw from her if she experiences menstrual bleeding during intercourse, then for both <b>this and that,</b> his entry and his withdrawal, he should be liable to bring only a single sin-offering, since he had no awareness of his transgression between his two actions. This <b>is</b> like one who <b>ate two olive-</b>bulks <b>of</b> forbidden <b>fat in</b> the course of <b>one lapse of awareness</b> and is therefore liable to bring only one sin-offering. Here too, although he performed two actions for which one could be liable to bring sin-offerings, entry and withdrawal, there was only one lapse of awareness.

### Part 2
<b>Rather,</b> it must be a case <b>where it was not near her expected date</b> of menstruation, and there was no reason for the man to think that the woman would experience menstrual bleeding. <b>And with whom</b> are we dealing? <b>If we say</b> that we are dealing with <b>a Torah scholar,</b> then <b>he should not be liable</b> to bring <b>even one</b> sin-offering, because <b>with regard to</b> his initial <b>entry,</b> he was <b>a victim of circumstances beyond his control,</b> and <b>with regard to</b> his <b>withdrawal,</b> after he knew that she was a menstruating woman, his transgression was <b>intentional,</b> and he would be liable to receive <i>karet</i>. And <b>if</b> we are dealing <b>with an <i>am ha’aretz</i>, he should be liable</b> to bring only <b>one</b> sin-offering, <b>for</b> his immediate <b>withdrawal.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rava</b> reconsidered and <b>then said: Actually,</b> it is a case where it was <b>near the expected date of</b> the woman’s menstruation, <b>and</b> we are dealing <b>with a Torah scholar. But</b> he is <b>a Torah scholar</b> only <b>with regard to this</b> <i>halakha</i>, that it is prohibited to engage in intercourse with a woman near the expected onset of her menstruation, and he erred in thinking that he could complete the act of intercourse before she experienced menstrual bleeding. Therefore, once he learns that she has experienced menstrual bleeding, he is liable to bring a sin-offering for his unwitting transgression at the time of his entry. <b>But</b> he is <b>not a Torah scholar with regard to that</b> <i>halakha</i>, that it is prohibited for one to immediately withdraw from a woman if she experiences menstrual bleeding during intercourse. Since he had awareness of his transgression between his two actions, this is not an instance of one lapse of awareness, and therefore he is liable to bring a second sin-offering for his unwitting transgression at the time of his withdrawal.

### Part 4
<b>Rava said: And we learn both of these</b> matters for which he is liable to bring a sin-offering; <b>we learn</b> about <b>entry,</b> and <b>we learn</b> about <b>withdrawal.</b> Rava now clarifies the matter: <b>We learn</b> about <b>withdrawal, as</b> the mishna <b>teaches:</b> If a man <b>was engaging in intercourse with a ritually pure woman, and</b> during the course of their act of intercourse <b>she</b> experienced menstrual bleeding and <b>said to him: I have become impure, and</b> unwittingly <b>he immediately withdrew</b> from her, he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin-offering for engaging in intercourse with a menstruating woman.

### Part 5
Rava continues: <b>We learn</b> about <b>entry</b> in a mishna (<i>Nidda</i> 14a): If a spot of blood <b>is found on his</b> rag, i.e., the rag that he uses to wipe his penis after intercourse, then it is clear that this blood came from the woman during their act of intercourse. Consequently, both the man and the woman <b>are impure and are liable to</b> bring a sin-<b>offering</b> for their unwitting transgression. Rava explains: <b>What, is it not</b> the case that the mishna speaks here of one who engaged in intercourse with a woman <b>near the expected date of</b> her menstruation, <b>and</b> it teaches that he is liable to bring a sin-offering <b>for</b> his initial <b>entry</b> at that time?

### Part 6
<b>Rav Adda bar Mattana said to Rava: Actually, I</b> could <b>say to you</b> that the mishna speaks here of one who engaged in intercourse with a woman <b>not near the expected date of</b> her menstruation, <b>and</b> he is liable to bring a sin-offering <b>for</b> his immediate <b>withdrawal</b> upon learning that she had experienced menstrual bleeding. <b>And if you would say: Why do I</b> need to be taught once again about <b>withdrawal? Didn’t</b> the <i>tanna</i> already <b>teach this</b> in the mishna here? One can respond: <b>It was necessary to teach us this,</b> i.e., the continuation of the mishna in tractate <i>Nidda</i>, which states: If a spot of blood <b>is found on her</b> rag, i.e., the rag that she uses to wipe herself after intercourse, <b>they are impure</b> only <b>because of an uncertainty,</b> as perhaps the bleeding commenced only after they completed their act of intercourse, <b>and</b> therefore <b>they are exempt from</b> bringing a sin-<b>offering. And since</b> the mishna <b>had to teach</b> the case where the blood <b>was found on her</b> rag, <b>it also taught</b> the case where <b>it was found on his</b> rag, even though there is no novel element in this ruling.

### Part 7
<b>Ravina said to Rav Adda: Can you</b> really <b>interpret that</b> mishna as referring to a case <b>where it was not near the expected date of</b> the woman’s menstruation, <b>and</b> that he is liable to bring a sin-offering <b>for</b> his <b>withdrawal? But isn’t it taught</b> in that mishna: If blood <b>is found</b> on his rag? <b>And</b> these words <b>indicate</b> that the blood <b>was found</b> only <b>afterward,</b> after the man had already withdrawn from the woman. That is to say, only after he withdrew from the woman he learned that she had experienced menstrual bleeding. Ravina clarifies the difficulty: <b>And if</b> the mishna is referring to a case where he is liable <b>for</b> his <b>withdrawal, at the outset, when he withdrew</b> from the woman, it was <b>from then that he had knowledge</b> of her menstrual status, as he withdrew because she had informed him that she had experienced bleeding. Of what significance is his finding blood on his rag?

### Part 8
<b>Rava said to</b> Rav Adda: <b>Listen to what your teacher,</b> Ravina, <b>is saying,</b> as he has explained the matter. Rav Adda said to Rava: <b>How can I</b> listen to his words and accept his explanation? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to</b> this mishna concerning blood found on a rag: <b>This is the positive mitzva with regard to a menstruating woman for which one is liable.</b> Rav Adda explains: <b>And if it is so</b> that the mishna is referring to a case where the man is liable for his initial entry, this wording is difficult, as engaging in intercourse with a menstruating woman <b>is</b> not the violation of a positive mitzva, but <b>a prohibition.</b>

### Part 9
Rava <b>said to him: If you learned</b> this <i>baraita</i> in this manner, its wording is imprecise, as <b>it is missing</b> words, <b>and you should teach</b> it <b>like this:</b> When blood is found on the man’s rag, <b>this is the prohibition with regard to a menstruating woman for which one is liable.</b> And additionally, if a man <b>was engaging in intercourse with a ritually pure woman, and</b> during the course of their act of intercourse <b>she</b> experienced menstrual bleeding and <b>said to him: I have become impure, and</b> unwittingly <b>he immediately withdrew</b> from her, he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin-offering for that act, and <b>this is the positive mitzva</b> for which one is liable <b>with regard to a menstruating woman.</b>

### Part 10
§ The Gemara resumes its discussion of the mishna: <b>The Master said</b> above in the mishna: If <b>he immediately withdrew</b> from the woman after having been informed that she had experienced menstrual bleeding, he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin-offering for engaging in intercourse with a menstruating woman. The Gemara asks: <b>What should</b> one <b>do</b> in such a situation? <b>Rav Huna said in the name of Rava:</b> He should <b>press his ten fingernails into the ground,</b> i.e., the bed, and restrain himself and do nothing <b>until</b> his penis <b>becomes flaccid,</b> and only then should he withdraw from her, <b>and it is good for him</b> to do so.

### Part 11
<b>Rava said: That is to say, one who engages in intercourse, with a flaccid</b> penis, <b>with those with whom relations are forbidden</b> is <b>exempt. As if it enters your mind</b> to say that he is <b>liable, here,</b> in the mishna, <b>what is the reason</b> that he is <b>exempt</b> if he waits and withdraws only later, after he has lost his erection? You might say that <b>it is because he is a victim of circumstances beyond his control</b> in that the woman experienced menstrual bleeding while he was in the middle of the act of intercourse, and not because he withdrew with a flaccid penis, as one who engages in intercourse with a flaccid penis is liable. But <b>if</b> he is exempt from liability because <b>he is a victim of circumstances beyond his control,</b> then even <b>if he withdraws immediately,</b> before losing his erection, <b>he should also be exempt,</b> for the same reason, that <b>he is a victim of circumstances beyond his control.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>Actually, I</b> could <b>say to you</b> that <b>one who engages in intercourse, with a flaccid</b> penis, <b>with those with whom relations are forbidden is liable. And here, what is the reason</b> that one who waits and withdraws only later, after he has lost his erection, is <b>exempt?</b> It is <b>because he is</b> considered <b>a victim of circumstances beyond his control. And</b> concerning <b>that which you said: Why,</b> then, is he <b>liable if he withdrew immediately,</b> i.e., when you said: He should also be exempt, it is because <b>he should have withdrawn with</b> a flaccid penis and experienced <b>little pleasure, but</b> instead <b>he withdrew with</b> an erect organ and experienced <b>great pleasure.</b>

### Part 13
<b>Rabba bar Ḥanan said to Abaye: If so,</b> according to your opinion, <b>we find</b> a difference in <i>halakha</i> between <b>a long</b> way <b>and a short</b> way <b>with regard to a menstruating woman.</b> If he withdrew the short way, i.e., without waiting, he has committed a transgression, and if he withdrew the long way, i.e., after waiting, he has not committed a transgression.
