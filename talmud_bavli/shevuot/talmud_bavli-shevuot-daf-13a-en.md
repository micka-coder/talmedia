### Part 1
The mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> the person did not repent and <b>persists in his rebellion, and it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, that even for such a case Yom Kippur and the scapegoat will atone. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: For all transgressions that are</b> stated <b>in the Torah, whether one repented,</b> or <b>whether one did not repent, Yom Kippur atones, except for one who divests</b> himself of the <b>yoke</b> of Heaven, by denying God’s existence, <b>and one who reveals facets of the Torah</b> that differ from its true meaning, <b>and one who nullifies</b> the <b>covenant of</b> circumcision of <b>the flesh. For</b> these, <b>if one repented, Yom Kippur atones, and if not, Yom Kippur does not atone.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? It is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> in interpretation of the verse: “For he scorned the word of the Lord and nullified His commandment; that person will be cut off [<i>hikkaret tikkaret</i>], his sin is upon him” (Numbers 15:31): <b>“For he scorned the word of the Lord”; this</b> is referring to <b>one who divests</b> himself <b>of</b> the <b>yoke</b> of Heaven <b>and one who reveals facets of the Torah</b> that differ from its true meaning. <b>“And nullified His commandment”; this</b> is referring to <b>one who nullified the covenant of</b> circumcision of <b>the flesh.</b> The use of the double verb form <b><i>hikkaret tikkaret</i></b> teaches that <b>he will be cut off,</b> i.e., he is liable to receive <i>karet</i>, <b>before Yom Kippur, and he will</b> still <b>be cut off after Yom Kippur,</b> as Yom Kippur does not atone for him.

### Part 3
One <b>might</b> have thought that this applies <b>even</b> if <b>he repented.</b> To counter this, <b>the verse states: “His sin is upon him,”</b> by which God indicates: <b>I said</b> that Yom Kippur does not atone for these sins <b>only when his sin is</b> still <b>upon him,</b> as he did not repent. It is apparent from this <i>baraita</i> that it is only for the three sins mentioned that Yom Kippur does not atone without repentance, but Yom Kippur atones for other sins even if one did not repent.

### Part 4
<b>And</b> with regard to <b>the Rabbis</b> who disagree with Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, how do they interpret the verse? If someone commits one of the three sins mentioned, then <b>he is cut off [<i>hikkaret</i>]</b> from life <b>in this world,</b> and <b>he will be cut off [<i>tikkaret</i>] in the World-to-Come.</b> The phrase <b>“His sin is upon him”</b> teaches <b>that if he repented and died,</b> his <b>death cleanses</b> him of his sin.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>And can you interpret</b> the mishna to be <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? <b>But from</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> by inference, <b>the first clause is also</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> but not of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>as the latter clause</b> of the mishna <b>teaches: Israelites and priests and</b> the <b>anointed priest,</b> i.e., the High Priest, all equally achieve atonement from the scapegoat. <b>And who accepts this reasoning? Rabbi Yehuda,</b> as the Gemara will demonstrate. <b>By inference, the first clause</b> is also in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> not of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Yosef said:</b> It is possible that the entire mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and</b> the latter clause does not pose a difficulty, because with regard to whether priests achieve atonement through the scapegoat, <b>he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Abaye said to him:</b> Does <b>the Master</b> mean <b>specifically</b> what <b>he is saying,</b> i.e., that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> with regard to whether the scapegoat atones for both Israelites and priest, <b>but Rabbi Yehuda does not hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi with regard to atonement for one who did not repent? <b>Or perhaps from</b> the fact <b>that Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> it follows that <b>Rabbi Yehuda also holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>but</b> the reason that Rav Yosef did not make this clear is that <b>he teaches the matter in the manner in which it</b> typically occurs, which is <b>to say that a disciple,</b> in this case, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>his teacher,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yehuda.

### Part 8
Rav Yosef <b>said to him: Yes,</b> I mean <b>specifically</b> what <b>I was saying: Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, but Rabbi Yehuda does not hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.

### Part 9
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> recorded in the <i>Sifra</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>Yom Kippur would atone for those who repent and for those who do not repent, and</b> this assertion <b>is</b> supported by the following <b>logical inference:</b> Although it would appear that <b>since a sin-offering and a guilt-offering atone and Yom Kippur atones,</b> it should follow that <b>just as a sin-offering and a guilt-offering atone only for those who repent, so too, Yom Kippur atones only for those who repent,</b> this comparison is flawed. One can claim: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about a sin-offering and a guilt-offering?</b> They are notable in <b>that they do not atone for intentional</b> sins <b>like</b> they do for <b>unwitting</b> sins. <b>Can you say</b> the same <b>about Yom Kippur, which does atone for intentional</b> sins <b>as</b> it does for <b>unwitting</b> sins?

### Part 10
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Since</b> it is the case that the atonement of Yom Kippur is more far-reaching in that <b>it atones for intentional</b> sins <b>as</b> it does for <b>unwitting</b> sins, it follows that <b>it should atone</b> both <b>for those who repent and for those who do not repent.</b> To counter this, <b>the verse states: “Yet</b> on the tenth day of this seventh month it is Yom Kippur” (Leviticus 23:27). The word “yet” serves to <b>divide</b> and limit the atonement of Yom Kippur in that it atones only for those who repent.

### Part 11
Rav Yosef attributes the <i>baraita</i> to Rabbi Yehuda: <b>Whose</b> opinion is expressed by the <b>unattributed</b> <i>baraitot</i> in the <b><i>Sifra</i>? Rabbi Yehuda. And he says:</b> For <b>those who repent, yes,</b> Yom Kippur atones, but for <b>those who do not repent,</b> Yom Kippur does <b>not</b> atone.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>But raise a contradiction,</b> setting one <b>unattributed</b> <i>baraita</i> in the <b><i>Sifra</i>,</b> i.e., the one just cited, <b>against</b> another <b>unattributed</b> <i>baraita</i> in the <b><i>Sifra</i>, as</b> in another <i>baraita</i> there <b>it is taught:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>Yom Kippur would atone only if one fasted on it and declared it a holy convocation and did not perform labor on it. From where</b> is it derived that even if <b>one did not fast on it and did not declare it a holy convocation and performed labor on it,</b> that it still atones? <b>The verse states:</b> “Yet on the tenth day of this seventh month <b>it is Yom Kippur”</b> (Leviticus 23:27). The additional emphasis on “it is” serves to teach that the day atones <b>in any case.</b> This <i>baraita</i> contradicts the one cited above that states clearly that Yom Kippur atones only for those who repent.

### Part 13
<b>Abaye said:</b> This is <b>not difficult: This</b> second <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and that</b> first <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Rava said:</b> Both <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> <i>baraita</i> are in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, who holds that Yom Kippur atones for those who do not repent, <b>but</b> even <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>concedes</b> that <b>with regard to</b> avoiding the punishment of <b><i>karet</i></b> incurred <b>for</b> violating <b>the day</b> of Yom Kippur, Yom Kippur atones and one is not liable to be punished with <i>karet</i> only if one repented for the sin of violating the day of Yom Kippur. Perforce he must concede this point, <b>as if you do not say so,</b> then <b>according to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>there would be no</b> instance in which one would be liable to be punished with <b><i>karet</i> for</b> violating <b>Yom Kippur.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara questions this proof: <b>Why not? You</b> could <b>find it</b> in a case <b>where he performed</b> labor <b>on the night</b> of Yom Kippur <b>and died</b> that night, <b>as</b> in such a case, <b>the daytime</b> of Yom Kippur, which is the part of Yom Kippur that effects atonement, <b>never came to atone for him.</b>

### Part 16
<b>Rather, say</b> that Rava’s proof is as follows:
