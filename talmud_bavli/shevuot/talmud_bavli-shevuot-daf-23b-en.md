### Part 1
The Gemara rejects this: <b>But</b> if he had said it that way, <b>perhaps</b> his oath could be interpreted to prohibit only bread made <b>from a mixture</b> of all these grains.

### Part 2
The Gemara suggests: If the specification in the mishna serves merely to ensure that his oath does not extend to other foods, have him <b>say:</b> Bread made from wheat <b>and so from barley and so from spelt. Why do I</b> need to repeat: <b>Bread, bread,</b> each time? <b>Conclude from it</b> that the point of repeating the word bread each time is <b>to individuate</b> each statement as a separate oath.

### Part 3
§ The mishna teaches: If he said: On my <b>oath I will not drink, and</b> then <b>he drank several</b> kinds of <b>liquids, he is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> offering. If he says: On my oath I will not drink wine, or oil, or honey, and he drank all of them, he is liable to bring an offering for each and every one. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, there,</b> in the case of the bread, the ruling of the mishna is understood, <b>as you said</b> that the word <b>bread</b> before barley, and the word <b>bread</b> before spelt <b>are superfluous</b> and serve <b>to</b> extend his <b>liability</b> so that each is considered an independent oath. <b>But here,</b> where there is no superfluous language, <b>what was there to say? Perhaps</b> the oath <b>comes to</b> ensure that he <b>exempts himself</b> so that the oath does not extend <b>to other liquids.</b> Since that is a possibility, he should not be liable for breaking three separate oaths when he drank all three liquids.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Pappa said: We are dealing here with</b> a situation where all three liquids are <b>placed before him.</b> Under the circumstances, if he merely wished to indicate that his oath is limited to these liquids, <b>he could have said:</b> On my <b>oath I will not drink these.</b> Since he instead specified the liquids in the oath, it was in order to indicate that each should be considered as a separate oath. The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> had he said: I will not drink these, <b>perhaps</b> his oath would be interpreted as meaning: <b>It is these</b> liquids, which are before me right now, <b>that I will not drink,</b> but <b>I will drink other</b> wine, oil, and honey.

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> if he merely wished to indicate that his oath is limited to these types of liquids, it would be a case <b>where he said:</b> On my <b>oath I will not drink</b> liquids <b>such as these.</b> The Gemara challenges: Had he said it that way, <b>perhaps</b> it could be interpreted as referring to the volume of the liquids: <b>I will not drink</b> liquids <b>such as these,</b> but <b>I will drink less than this or more than this.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> if he merely wished to indicate that his oath is limited to these types of liquids, it is a case <b>where he said:</b> On my <b>oath I will not drink from these types</b> of liquids. The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> had he said it that way, <b>perhaps</b> his oath would be interpreted to mean: <b>I will not drink these types</b> of liquids in general, <b>but I will drink these particular</b> liquids in front of me.

### Part 7
The Gemara suggests: If the point of the specification of the liquids in the mishna was merely to ensure that his oath does not extend to other liquids, have him <b>say:</b> On my oath <b>I will not drink these and</b> liquids of <b>their types.</b> Since he instead specified: Wine, oil, and honey, one may conclude that his intention was to individuate each liquid as a separate oath.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, said: We are dealing with</b> a case in <b>which another is importuning him</b> to drink, <b>as</b> he <b>said to him: Come, drink wine, and oil, and honey with me;</b> if he wanted him to desist, <b>he should have said:</b> On my <b>oath I will not drink with you.</b> Under these circumstances, <b>why do I</b> need him to specify: <b>Wine, and oil, and honey?</b> The specification of the liquids serves to indicate his intention <b>to render</b> himself <b>liable for each and every one.</b>

### Part 9
§ <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (36b) with regard to an oath concerning a deposit, that if one says to his bailee: <b>Give me my wheat, barley, and spelt</b> that are <b>in your possession,</b> and the bailee lies and says: On my <b>oath nothing of yours is in my possession, he is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> guilt-offering. But if the bailee says: On my <b>oath I do not have in my possession</b> any <b>wheat, barley, or spelt that belong to you,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring a separate offering <b>for each and every one.</b>

### Part 10
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> with regard to that mishna that he is liable <b>even</b> if the value <b>of all</b> three species <b>combines</b> to amount to as little as one <b><i>peruta</i>.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rav Aḥa and Ravina disagree with regard to this. One said:</b> When the bailee says: On my oath I do not have in my possession any wheat, barley, or spelt that belong to you, <b>he is liable</b> to bring a guilt-offering only <b>for</b> violating the <b>specific</b> oaths for individual types of grain, and <b>he is not liable for</b> violating a general oath that he does not have anything in his possession. Consequently, Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement that the different types of grains can be combined to amount to one <i>peruta</i> is referring only to the oath in the first clause of the mishna where he did not specify the grains. <b>And one said: He is also liable for</b> violating a general oath, and in the latter clause of the mishna he is liable for violating four oaths: One general oath that he does not have anything in his possession and three specific oaths, one for each type of grain. Consequently, Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement applies also to where he specifies the grains, and he is liable to bring one offering even when all three species combine to amount to only one <i>peruta</i>.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>Here,</b> in the case of one who takes an oath that he will not eat wheat bread, barley bread, or spelt bread, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Is there a dispute as to whether he is considered to have taken a general oath alongside the specific oaths?

### Part 13
<b>Rava said: How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> in the case of an oath of a deposit, he is <b>liable for</b> the <b>general</b> oath <b>and for</b> the <b>specific</b> oath, <b>since if</b> a bailee <b>takes an oath</b> denying that he is in possession of a deposit <b>and then takes another oath</b> to the same effect, he is <b>liable</b> for taking <b>two</b> false oaths on a deposit. <b>Here,</b> with regard to an oath to prohibit oneself from eating, <b>if it enters your mind</b> that <b>he is bound by a general</b> oath, <b>why would he be liable for the specific</b> oaths? <b>He is already under an oath</b> due to the general oath, and an oath cannot take effect when the matter it prohibits is already forbidden by another oath.

### Part 14
§ The mishna teaches that if one said: On my <b>oath I will not eat,</b> and he ate foods that are inedible, he is exempt. If he said: On my oath I will not eat, and then he ate the meat of unslaughtered carcasses, he is liable. The Gemara asks: <b>This</b> mishna <b>itself</b> is <b>difficult. You said</b> that if one said: On my <b>oath I will not eat, and he ate foods that are inedible, or drank liquids that are not potable,</b> he is <b>exempt. And then</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> that if one says: On my <b>oath I will not eat, and</b> then he <b>ate</b> the meat of <b>unslaughtered carcasses or <i>tereifot</i>, repugnant creatures or creeping animals,</b> he is <b>liable. What is different</b> about <b>the first clause that</b> he is <b>exempt and what is different</b> about <b>the latter clause that</b> he is <b>liable?</b> Non-kosher animals are also unfit to be eaten.

### Part 15
The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult. The first clause</b> is <b>where</b> he took an oath not to eat <b>without specifying</b> what is included in it. Presumably, his oath did not include items that are not ordinarily eaten. <b>And the latter clause</b> is a case <b>where he specifies</b> what it is he will not eat, e.g., unslaughtered carcasses, and nevertheless eats them.

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>You may also raise a difficulty</b> with regard to the case where he <b>specifies</b> that he will not eat non-kosher items: <b>Why? He is under oath from Mount Sinai,</b> and an oath does not take effect to prohibit that which is already forbidden.

### Part 17
<b>Rav and Shmuel and Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> all <b>say</b> that this is a case <b>where he incorporates</b> into the oath that he will not eat some <b>permitted items, along with</b> the statement concerning the <b>forbidden items.</b> Since the oath takes effect with regard to the permitted items, it extends also to the forbidden ones.

### Part 18
<b>And Reish Lakish says: You find</b> that one is liable for eating non-kosher food as the result of an oath <b>only if</b> it is an oath <b>where</b> he <b>specifies</b> that it includes <b>a half-measure, and in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis</b> that one is not liable for eating a half-measure unless it is specified in the oath. Since eating a half-measure is not prohibited by Torah law, the oath takes effect. Alternatively, you find that one is liable <b>if</b> he took the oath <b>without specifying</b> that the oath prohibits less than the usual measure, and <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Akiva, who says</b> that <b>a person renders himself prohibited from</b> eating <b>any amount</b> by taking an oath not to eat.

### Part 19
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> it is understood why <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan did not say like Reish Lakish, as he interprets the mishna</b> so that it is <b>in accordance with the opinion of everyone; but what is the reason that Reish Lakish does not say like</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan?</b>

### Part 20
The Gemara answers: Reish Lakish could <b>say to you: When we say</b> that a more <b>inclusive prohibition,</b> which adds additional aspects to the prohibition for the same individual, can take effect where there already is a prohibition in place,
