### Part 1
They would bring from them <b>dessert, like white figs, for the altar.</b> The Gemara asks: Are white figs ever offered on the altar? <b>But isn’t it written: “For any leavening or fruit honey</b> you shall not cause to go up in smoke as a fire-offering to the Lord” (Leviticus 2:11)? The term “fruit honey” includes all tree fruits. The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Ḥanina teaches:</b> The supplementary offerings are to the altar <b>like white figs for a person.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara discusses what may be used for the supplementary offerings: <b>Rav Naḥman bar Rav Ḥisda taught: One does not supplement</b> the offerings of the altar <b>with a bird burnt-offering. Rava said: This</b> ruling <b>is an absurdity [<i>burkha</i>]. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said to Rava: What is the absurdity?</b> The ruling has a basis. <b>I said</b> this ruling <b>to</b> Rav Naḥman, <b>and said it to him in the name of Rav Shimi of Neharde’a, as Rav Shimi of Neharde’a says: The surplus</b> lambs that were consecrated for the daily offerings <b>are allocated for communal gift</b> offerings, <b>and there is not a bird burnt-offering</b> that is offered <b>by the community.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara notes: <b>And also Shmuel holds in accordance with this</b> statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who taught that Rabbi Shimon holds that lambs consecrated for the daily offering that were not used are brought as supplementary offerings, even though they were not originally consecrated for that purpose, <b>as Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> With regard to <b>communal offerings,</b> their consecration serves only to define which general category of offering they are included in, e.g., whether they are a sin-offering or burnt-offering, but it is the purpose for which they are ultimately slaughtered with <b>a knife</b> that <b>defines what their</b> precise nature <b>is.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara notes: <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to sin-offerings: <b>And Rabbi Shimon concedes with regard to a goat</b> consecrated to be used as part of the additional offerings on the pilgrimage Festivals <b>that if it was not sacrificed on a pilgrimage Festival it can be sacrificed on a New Moon, and if was not sacrificed on a New Moon it can be sacrificed on Yom Kippur, and if it was not sacrificed on Yom Kippur it can be sacrificed on a pilgrimage Festival, and if was not sacrificed on this pilgrimage Festival, it can be sacrificed on another pilgrimage Festival.</b> This is <b>because from the outset,</b> by virtue of its consecration, <b>it came only to atone</b> by having its blood presented <b>upon the external altar,</b> but its precise nature is defined only by the purpose for which it is ultimately slaughtered.

### Part 5
Another <i>baraita</i> teaches the same ruling: <b>It is taught:</b> The sin-offering <b>was consecrated only to atone</b> by having its blood presented <b>upon the external altar.</b>

### Part 6
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And for</b> cases in which the <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods was carried out <b>intentionally,</b> the <b>goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary on Yom Kippur, and Yom Kippur itself, atone. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived?

### Part 7
The Gemara answers: They are derived from a verse, <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the High Priest sacrificing the internal goat of Yom Kippur: <b>“And he shall effect atonement upon the Sanctuary from the impurities of the children of Israel</b> and from their acts of rebellion, for all their sins” (Leviticus 16:16). The verse is referring to two categories of sin. The first category is <b>acts of rebellion [<i>pesha’im</i>]; these are the rebellious sins, and so</b> the verse <b>states</b> that King Jehoram of Israel said to King Jehoshaphat of Judah: <b>“The king of Moab rebelled [<i>pasha</i>] against me”</b> (II Kings 3:7). <b>And</b> the verse <b>states</b> with regard to a rebellion against Judah: <b>“Then Libnah rebelled [<i>tifsha</i>] at that time”</b> (II Kings 8:22). The second category is <b>sins [<i>ḥataot</i>]; these are unwitting sins, and so</b> the verse <b>states: “If an individual person shall transgress [<i>teḥeta</i>] unwittingly”</b> (Leviticus 4:2).

### Part 8
§ The mishna teaches: <b>For</b> all <b>other transgressions that are</b> stated <b>in the Torah,</b> whether they are <b>the minor</b> ones <b>or the major</b> ones, whether they were <b>intentional or unwitting,</b> whether one became aware of them before Yom Kippur or did not become aware of them until after Yom Kippur, whether they involve a positive mitzva or a prohibition, whether the transgressors are subject to excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>], or to one of the court-imposed death penalties, the scapegoat sent to Azazel on Yom Kippur atones.

### Part 9
The Gemara notes that the mishna appears repetitious: <b>Minor</b> ones <b>are the same as</b> a standard <b>positive mitzva and prohibition, major</b> ones <b>are the same as</b> transgressions that are subject to <b><i>karet</i> and</b> to <b>court</b>-imposed <b>death</b> penalties, transgressions that <b>one became aware</b> of <b>are the same as intentional</b> transgressions, and transgressions that <b>one did not become aware</b> of <b>are the same as unwitting</b> transgressions.

### Part 10
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying: For</b> all <b>other transgressions that are</b> stated <b>in the Torah, whether</b> they are the <b>minor</b> ones <b>or</b> the <b>major</b> ones, <b>whether they were performed unwittingly</b> or <b>whether they were performed intentionally,</b> they each have their own <i>halakhot</i>. For <b>those that were performed unwittingly,</b> in cases where there was an uncertainty whether the act was forbidden at all, atonement is effected <b>whether</b> the <b>uncertainty with regard to</b> the transgressions <b>became known to him</b> before Yom Kippur or <b>whether</b> the <b>uncertainty with regard to them did not become known to him</b> until after Yom Kippur. <b>And these are</b> the <b>minor</b> ones the mishna is referring to: A standard <b>positive mitzva and a prohibition. And these are</b> the <b>major</b> ones it is referring to: Transgressions that are subject to <b><i>karet</i> and</b> to <b>court</b>-imposed <b>death</b> penalties.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>this positive mitzva</b> in the mishna? <b>If</b> it is a case <b>where he did not repent,</b> the offering cannot atone for him, as the verse states: <b>“The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination”</b> (Proverbs 21:27). <b>If he did repent,</b> then why is the mishna referring to Yom Kippur? He will achieve atonement on <b>any</b> other <b>day as well, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one transgressed a positive mitzva and repented, he does not move from there until he is forgiven.</b>
