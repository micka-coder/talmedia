### Part 1
<b>as the son can collect both by</b> taking <b>an oath and without</b> taking <b>an oath, while the father can collect only by</b> taking <b>an oath. What are the circumstances</b> in which this occurs? It is <b>when</b> the <b>borrower died during the life of</b> the <b>lender.</b> The father who is the lender can collect from the borrower’s heirs only if he takes an oath.

### Part 2
<b>And it is taught: As the son can collect both by</b> taking <b>an oath and without</b> taking <b>an oath.</b> He collects <b>by</b> taking <b>an oath</b> when he takes <b>the heirs’ oath,</b> that he has no knowledge that his father’s debt was paid, and he collects <b>without</b> taking <b>an oath in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</b> in the mishna, that when there are witnesses that the father said at the time of his death that a certain promissory note had not been paid, the son collects the debt without taking an oath. In any case, absent testimony to that effect, the father bequeaths the oath to his children and the son can collect by taking an oath, contrary to the ruling of Rav and Shmuel.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Yosef said</b> in response: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai, who say</b> that a debt recorded in a promissory <b>note that stands to be collected</b> is considered <b>as if</b> it <b>is</b> already <b>collected.</b> Therefore, the father is considered to be already in possession of the loan and bequeaths it to his son. Even though the Sages instituted that the son take an oath to the heirs of the borrower, this is not a case of the son inheriting an oath.

### Part 4
§ It is related that <b>Rav Naḥman arrived in</b> the city of <b>Sura. Rav Ḥisda and Rabba bar Rav Huna came to</b> see <b>him. They said to him: Let</b> our <b>Master come,</b> and together <b>we will overturn that</b> ruling <b>of Rav and Shmuel.</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to them: Did I exert</b> myself <b>and come all these parasangs to uproot that</b> ruling <b>of Rav and Shmuel? Rather, let us not extend</b> their ruling by applying it to other situations outside the specific context of when the borrower died during the lifetime of the lender. The Gemara offers an example: This is <b>like what Rav Pappa says:</b> If a creditor <b>vitiates his</b> promissory <b>note,</b> by acknowledging that he has received partial payment and thereby rendering himself liable to take an oath in order to receive the rest, <b>and</b> then he <b>dies,</b> his <b>heirs take the heirs’ oath and collect</b> from the debtor.

### Part 5
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> debtor <b>who died and left a guarantor</b> of his debt, and the orphans of the creditor came to collect from the guarantor. <b>Rav Pappa thought to say: This, too, is</b> a case to which <b>one should not extend</b> Rav and Shmuel’s ruling, as they said only that orphans do not inherit an oath to collect from other orphans, and this should not apply to collecting from a guarantor. <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said to Rav Pappa: Is that to say</b> that <b>the guarantor will not pursue</b> the <b>orphans</b> and collect from them? Ultimately, collecting from the guarantor is tantamount to collecting from the orphans, and no distinction should be made.

### Part 6
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> creditor <b>who died and left a brother</b> as his heir, who wanted to collect from the orphans of the debtor. <b>Rami bar Ḥama thought to say</b> that <b>this, too, is</b> a case to which <b>one should not extend</b> Rav and Shmuel’s ruling, since Rav and Shmuel ruled that one does not bequeath an oath to one’s children, and they did not mention a case where the heir is a brother. <b>Rava said to him: What</b> difference does it make <b>to me</b> if the oath taken by the heir is: My <b>father did not inform me</b> that this debt has been paid, <b>and what</b> difference does it make <b>to me</b> if the oath taken is: <b>My brother did not inform me?</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rav Ḥama says: Now that the <i>halakha</i> was not stated either in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav and Shmuel or in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, a judge who rules in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav and Shmuel has ruled,</b> and his ruling is accepted, and a judge <b>who rules in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar has ruled,</b> and his ruling is accepted.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Pappa says:</b> When <b>that</b> promissory <b>note of orphans</b> comes before our court, <b>we do not tear it up, but we</b> also <b>do not collect</b> the debt <b>with it. We do not collect</b> the debt <b>with it,</b> since <b>perhaps we</b> should <b>hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> that orphans cannot collect debts in a case where their father was required to take an oath to collect, as they cannot take the appropriate oath; <b>but we do not tear it up, since a judge who rules in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar has ruled.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain judge who ruled in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar. There was a Torah scholar in his city. He said to</b> the judge: <b>I will bring a letter from the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, stating <b>that the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar.</b> The judge <b>said to him: When you bring</b> such a letter, I will consider it, but for now I stand by my ruling. That Torah scholar <b>came before Rav Ḥama,</b> and Rav Ḥama <b>said to him: A judge who rules in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar has ruled,</b> and his ruling cannot be voided.

### Part 10
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And these</b> people are sometimes required to <b>take an oath</b> that they do not owe anything even when there is no explicit claim against them: Partners, sharecroppers, stewards, a woman who does business from home, where she manages the property of orphans, and the member of the household appointed to manage the household’s affairs. The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>we are dealing with fools</b> who take an oath even though no claim has been brought against them? The Gemara explains: <b>This</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying: And these</b> people <b>take an oath without</b> it being in response <b>to a definite claim but</b> only <b>to an uncertain claim,</b> i.e., the claimant cannot know with certainty that he is owed money: <b>Partners, sharecroppers,</b> and the others listed in the mishna.

### Part 11
The Sages <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Ketubot</i> 9:3): With regard to the <b>member of the household whom they mentioned</b> in the mishna, this is <b>not</b> referring to one <b>who enters and exits</b> the house <b>on foot</b> as a family friend, but <b>rather</b> to one who <b>engages laborers, and dismisses laborers, gathers produce, and sends out produce</b> in managing the household.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is different</b> about <b>these</b> people listed in the mishna, e.g., partners, such that they are liable to take an oath in response to an uncertain claim? It is <b>because they</b> tend to <b>grant</b> themselves <b>permission</b> to take for themselves <b>from</b> the property for which they are responsible, using as an excuse the effort they invest in their duties.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Yosef bar Minyumi said</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> One takes an oath in response to an uncertain claim only <b>when there is a claim between them</b> worth at least <b>two silver</b> <i>ma’a</i>.

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this ruling? Is it <b>in accordance with</b> that of <b>Shmuel?</b> Shmuel holds that one becomes liable to take an oath after admitting to part of a claim when the value of the entire claim is at least two silver <i>ma’a</i>. Rav holds that the portion one denies he owes must be at least two <i>ma’a</i> (see 39b). <b>But didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya teach</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>in support of Rav?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that Rav Naḥman means that <b>the</b> value of the <b>denial of a claim</b> is at least two silver <i>ma’a</i>, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav.</b>

### Part 15
§ The mishna teaches: Once <b>the partners or the sharecroppers have divided</b> the common property, and each has taken his share, then one side may not require an oath of the other absent a definite claim. <b>A question was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>about extending</b> an oath to an additional situation, in a case where the original oath is <b>by rabbinic law?</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one borrowed from</b> another on the <b>eve of,</b> i.e., before, the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>and upon the conclusion of the Sabbatical</b> Year <b>became his partner or sharecropper,</b> the lender <b>may not extend</b> the partner’s or sharecropper’s oath to an oath about the loan. The Gemara infers: The <b>reason</b> he may not extend the oath is <b>that he borrowed from him</b> on the <b>eve of the Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>so that</b> the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year <b>came and abrogated</b> the loan, rendering the oath irrelevant. <b>Therefore,</b> if he borrowed during <b>the other years of the</b> seven-year <b>Sabbatical</b> cycle, an oath <b>may be extended</b> from the partner’s oath or sharecropper’s oath, which are rabbinic ordinances, to an oath about the loan.

### Part 17
The Gemara rejects that inference: <b>Do not say: Therefore,</b> if he borrowed during <b>the other years of the Sabbatical</b> cycle, an oath <b>may be extended. Rather, say</b> that one should infer from the <i>baraita</i> that if <b>he became his partner or sharecropper</b> on the <b>eve of the Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>and upon the conclusion of the Sabbatical</b> Year <b>he borrowed from him</b> and incurred an oath by Torah law, that oath <b>may be extended.</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara asks: Isn’t <b>that taught explicitly</b> in a <i>baraita</i>? It teaches: <b>If he became his partner or sharecropper on the eve of the Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>and upon the conclusion of the Sabbatical</b> Year <b>he borrowed from him,</b> the oath <b>may be extended.</b> Therefore, the initial inference must be correct. <b>Conclude from it</b> that an oath incurred <b>by rabbinic law may be extended.</b> The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from it</b> that this is so.

### Part 19
