### Part 1
In a case where he ate <b>both of them intentionally,</b> if he <b>ate</b> the loaf whose consumption was <b>his condition and then ate the forbidden</b> loaf, <b>he is liable</b> to receive lashes. If he <b>ate the forbidden</b> loaf <b>and then ate</b> the loaf whose consumption was <b>his condition,</b> his liability is the subject of <b>a dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish. According to the one who says that an uncertain forewarning is deemed</b> a valid <b>forewarning,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to receive lashes. <b>According to the one who says</b> that an uncertain forewarning <b>is not deemed</b> a valid <b>forewarning,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b> Since when he was forewarned for eating the forbidden loaf it was uncertain whether it would actually become forbidden, that forewarning is not sufficient for him to be liable to receive lashes.

### Part 2
If one took an oath with regard to two loaves such that he <b>rendered them interdependent, this</b> one <b>on that</b> one, saying: <b>I will not eat that if I eat this,</b> and: <b>I will not eat this if I eat that, and he ate this one intentionally</b> with regard to <b>itself,</b> i.e., at the time he ate it he was aware that he had taken an oath that would render it forbidden if he ate the other, <b>but unwittingly</b> with regard to <b>the other,</b> i.e., he did not remember that in eating it he rendered the second one forbidden, <b>and</b> then he ate <b>that one intentionally</b> with regard to <b>itself but unwittingly</b> with regard to <b>the other,</b> he is <b>exempt,</b> as both conditions were fulfilled only unintentionally.

### Part 3
If he ate <b>this</b> one <b>unwittingly</b> with regard to <b>itself,</b> having forgotten that it would be forbidden if he ate the other, <b>but intentionally</b> with regard to <b>the other,</b> understanding that with his action he rendered the other forbidden, <b>and that</b> one <b>unwittingly</b> with regard to <b>itself but intentionally</b> with regard to <b>the other,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring offerings for unwittingly breaking his oaths, as the conditions were fulfilled intentionally and the oaths took effect.

### Part 4
If he ate <b>both of them unwittingly</b> he is <b>exempt,</b> as both conditions were fulfilled only unintentionally.

### Part 5
If he ate <b>both of them intentionally, he is liable</b> to receive lashes <b>for</b> eating <b>the second</b> loaf, while <b>for the first</b> loaf his status depends on the <b>dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish</b> with regard to an uncertain forewarning.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Mari said: We learn</b> in the mishna (<i>Nedarim</i> 20b) <b>as well</b> that if one takes an oath with a condition but then fulfills the condition only unwittingly, he is exempt: <b>The Sages dissolved four</b> types of <b>vows</b> without the requirement of a request to a halakhic authority: <b>Vows of exhortation, vows of exaggeration, unwitting vows, and vows</b> whose fulfillment is impeded by <b>circumstances beyond</b> one’s <b>control.</b>

### Part 7
The mishna elaborates (see <i>Nedarim</i> 25b): <b>Unwitting vows, how so?</b> If one says: A certain item is <b>forbidden</b> to me <b>like an offering [<i>konam</i>] if I ate or if I drank, and</b> he then <b>remembers that he ate or drank,</b> or if one says: This loaf is <i>konam</i> for me if <b>I</b> will <b>eat or</b> if <b>I</b> will <b>drink, and he</b> then <b>forgets and eats or drinks,</b> the item <b>is permitted. And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to</b> that mishna: <b>Just as unwitting vows are dissolved, so are unwitting oaths dissolved,</b> since he fulfilled the condition while lacking awareness that he was doing so.

### Part 8
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>unwitting oaths? Is it not a case like this,</b> where he takes an oath with a condition and then fulfills the condition of the oath unwittingly? <b>Conclude from</b> that mishna that there is support for Rava’s opinion.

### Part 9
§ It is related that the Sage <b>Eifa learned</b> tractate <b><i>Shevuot</i> in the academy of Rabba. His brother Avimi met him</b> and tested him concerning the <i>halakhot</i> of oaths. Avimi <b>said to him:</b> If one says: On my <b>oath I did not eat,</b> and then again: On my <b>oath I did not eat, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Eifa <b>said to him: He is liable only once</b> if he ate. Avimi <b>said to him: You have confused</b> the issue. Since the oaths are about the past, it is not a question of whether the second oath takes effect. Each time, <b>a false oath was issued,</b> and each was a separate transgression.

### Part 10
Avimi asked him further: If one said: On my <b>oath I will not eat nine</b> pieces <b>and</b> on my oath I will not eat <b>ten, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Eifa replied: <b>He is liable for each and every one</b> of the oaths, as the scope of the second oath is broader than that of the first. Avimi <b>said to him: You have confused</b> the issue: <b>If he may not eat nine, he may not eat ten.</b> The oath not to eat ten cannot take effect, since it is an action already prohibited by the oath not to eat nine.

### Part 11
Avimi asked him further: If one said: On my <b>oath I will not eat ten and</b> on my oath I will not eat <b>nine, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Eifa replied: <b>He is liable</b> for <b>only one</b> oath. Avimi <b>said to him: You have confused</b> the issue. According to the first oath, it <b>is ten that he may not eat, but he may still eat nine,</b> so the second oath takes effect, in that it prohibits him from eating nine.

### Part 12
<b>Abaye said:</b> There are <b>times when you find that</b> the ruling <b>of Eifa</b> with regard to an oath not to eat ten followed by an oath not to eat nine applies, <b>as</b> in the case mentioned by <b>the Master. As Rabba says:</b> In the case of one who says: On my <b>oath I will not eat figs and grapes</b> together, <b>and then says:</b> On my <b>oath I will not eat figs,</b>
