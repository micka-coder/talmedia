### Part 1
<b>And</b> there is <b>a dispute with regard to witnesses</b> in the case <b>of a <i>sota</i>;</b> this is referring <b>to witnesses of seclusion</b> who testify that the woman who was warned by her husband in fact entered into seclusion with the man in question. One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, <b>holds</b> that <b>a matter that causes financial</b> loss <b>is considered</b> to have <b>monetary</b> value, <b>and</b> each witness is <b>liable</b> for taking a false oath of testimony, as had they testified the woman would lose her marriage contract. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the Rabbis, <b>hold</b> that a matter that causes financial loss <b>is not considered</b> to have <b>monetary</b> value, <b>and he is exempt.</b>

### Part 2
§ It is stated above further: <b>All concede with regard to</b> a witness testifying on behalf of the claimant <b>when his counterpart is suspect about the oath. All concede in</b> the case of <b>one witness,</b> as in the incident <b>with Rabbi Abba.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara elaborates: <b>All concede with regard to</b> a witness testifying on behalf of the claimant <b>when his counterpart is suspect about the oath.</b> The testimony of one witness renders the borrower liable to take an oath that he does not owe money. The Gemara asks: In a case <b>where who is suspect? If we say that the borrower</b> who is denying the debt <b>is suspect,</b> and it is a case <b>where the lender says to</b> the witness: <b>If you came</b> and <b>testified on my</b> behalf <b>I would have taken an oath and taken</b> the sum owed me from the borrower, since he is suspect with regard to oaths, why would the witness be liable for taking a false oath of testimony? <b>Let</b> the witness <b>say to</b> the lender: <b>Who</b> could <b>say that you</b> would have <b>taken an oath?</b> Since there is no certainty that he would have taken the oath, the witness is merely the cause of a cause of financial loss.

### Part 4
<b>Rather,</b> it is a case <b>where both</b> the borrower and the lender <b>are suspect, as the Master says:</b> Since both are suspect, the <b>oath reverts to the one who is</b> initially <b>obligated to take it,</b> i.e., the borrower, <b>and since he is unable to take the oath</b> because he is suspect, <b>he pays</b> the entire claim to the lender. One witness rendered the borrower liable to pay the debt.

### Part 5
Abaye said: <b>All concede in</b> the case of <b>one witness,</b> as in the incident <b>with Rabbi Abba.</b> What are the circumstances? <b>As</b> there was <b>a certain man who snatched</b> a silver <b>ingot from another.</b> The one from whom it was taken <b>came before Rabbi Ami</b> while <b>Rabbi Abba was sitting before him,</b> and he <b>went</b> and <b>brought one witness</b> who testified <b>that</b> the defendant indeed <b>snatched it from him.</b> The one who snatched it <b>said to him: Yes,</b> it is true that <b>I snatched</b> it, <b>but I</b> merely <b>snatched</b> that which was <b>mine.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Ami said: How shall judges rule in this case? Let</b> the judges require him to <b>pay.</b> But <b>there are not two witnesses</b> who witnessed the robbery. <b>Let</b> the judges rule to <b>exempt him</b> from payment. <b>But there is one witness that he snatched</b> the ingot. Based on the testimony of that witness, <b>let</b> the alleged robber <b>take an oath</b> that he did not snatch the ingot. But <b>once he said: Yes, I snatched</b> it, <b>but I</b> merely <b>snatched</b> that which was <b>mine,</b> his halakhic status <b>is like</b> that of <b>a robber,</b> who is disqualified from taking an oath. <b>Rabbi Abba said to him: He is</b> one who is <b>obligated</b> to take <b>an oath but is unable to take an oath, and anyone who is obligated</b> to take <b>an oath but is unable to take an oath</b> is liable to <b>pay.</b> In that case, were that witness to take a false oath and deny knowledge of the matter, he would be liable.

### Part 7
§ <b>Rav Pappa says: All concede with regard to</b> the <b>witness of a death that he is liable</b> for taking an oath of testimony if he took a false oath and denied knowledge of the incident, <b>and all concede with regard to</b> the <b>witness of a death that he is exempt</b> in that case.

### Part 8
The Gemara elaborates: <b>All concede with regard to</b> the <b>witness of a death that he is exempt where he said to</b> the wife <b>herself</b> that her husband is dead, <b>but he did not tell</b> it <b>to the court,</b> and now he denies his earlier statement, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 1:12): <b>The woman who said: My husband died, shall remarry</b> on the basis of her own testimony. Likewise, if she says: <b>My husband died, she shall enter into levirate marriage</b> with her brother-in-law on the basis of her own testimony. The fact that the witness subsequently denied knowledge of the matter does not cause her to lose her marriage contract, since she can come to the court and testify based on the statement of the witness and collect her marriage contract.

### Part 9
<b>All concede with regard to</b> the <b>witness of a death that he is liable</b> in a case <b>where he did not say</b> that the husband is dead <b>to</b> the wife <b>herself nor did he say</b> it <b>to the court.</b> In that case, his denial of knowledge of the matter causes the wife to lose payment of her marriage contract.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: Shall we <b>conclude from</b> here that according to Rav Pappa, in the case of <b>one who administers an oath to witnesses</b> with regard to <b>land,</b> the witnesses are <b>liable</b> for taking a false oath of testimony, given that the marriage contract here is collected from land belonging to the husband? This matter is subject to a dispute between the Sages (37b). The Gemara answers: No proof may be cited from here, as <b>perhaps</b> Rav Pappa is referring to a case <b>where she seizes</b> her husband’s <b>movable property</b> as payment for her marriage contract. Therefore, this is not considered testimony with regard to land.

### Part 11
§ The mishna teaches: If <b>one</b> of the two witnesses <b>denied</b> knowledge of the incident, <b>and</b> the other <b>one admitted</b> that he had knowledge and proceeded to testify, <b>the one who denies</b> knowledge of the incident is <b>liable.</b> The Gemara asks: Why was it necessary to teach this <i>halakha</i> in the mishna? <b>Now</b> that in the previous case, where the potential witnesses <b>both</b> denied knowledge of the matter <b>one after the other, you said: The first is liable and the second is exempt,</b> in a case where <b>one denied</b> knowledge <b>and one admitted</b> that he had knowledge and proceeded to testify, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to mention that the one who denied knowledge is liable?

### Part 12
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to state this <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where both of them denied</b> knowledge of the matter, <b>and one of them retracted</b> his denial <b>and admitted</b> to knowledge of the matter <b>within</b> the time required <b>for speaking</b> a short phrase. <b>And this teaches us that</b> the halakhic status of a pause or retraction <b>within</b> the time required <b>for speaking</b> a short phrase <b>is like</b> that of continuous <b>speech.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to Rav Ḥisda, who interprets</b> the previous case in the mishna in which the two witnesses denied knowledge of the incident as one, and they are liable <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili,</b> a different <i>halakha</i> may be learned from each clause in the mishna. It is learned from <b>the first clause</b> that it is <b>possible</b> for two events <b>to coincide precisely, and the latter clause was necessary to teach us that</b> the halakhic status of a pause or retraction <b>within</b> the time required <b>for speaking</b> a short phrase <b>is like</b> that of continuous <b>speech. But according to Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> the <i>halakha</i> of: <b>Within</b> the time required <b>for speaking</b> a short phrase, is learned from <b>the first clause,</b> and the <i>halakha</i> of: <b>Within</b> the time required <b>for speaking</b> a short phrase, is learned from <b>the latter clause. Why do I</b> need <b>two</b> clauses to teach the same <i>halakha</i>?

### Part 14
The Gemara answers: Even according to Rabbi Yoḥanan, both clauses are necessary. <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>this statement:</b> The halakhic status of a pause or retraction within the time required for speaking a short phrase is like that of continuous speech, applies only in a case where the first statement is <b>a denial and</b> the second statement is <b>a denial; but</b> in a case where the first statement is <b>a denial and</b> the second statement is <b>an admission, say</b> that <b>no,</b> its halakhic status is not like that of continuous speech and one cannot admit knowledge after having denied it. Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that even in a case where he retracts the denial and admits his knowledge, its halakhic status is not like that of continuous speech.

### Part 15
§ The mishna teaches: If <b>there were two sets of witnesses</b> that took the oath of testimony, and <b>the first</b> set <b>denied</b> knowledge of the matter <b>and thereafter, the second</b> set <b>denied</b> knowledge of the matter, both sets of witnesses are liable. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> the <b>second</b> set <b>will be held liable, as</b> since <b>the first</b> set <b>denied</b> knowledge of the matter, the ability of the plaintiff to collect his monetary claim is dependent exclusively on the second set, and their denial caused his loss. <b>But why</b> is the <b>first</b> set liable?
