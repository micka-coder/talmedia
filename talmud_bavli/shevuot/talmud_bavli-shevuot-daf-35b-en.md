### Part 1
or <b>in</b> the name of <b>He Who is compassionate,</b> that the <i>tanna</i> <b>is stating</b> the <i>halakha</i>. Although gracious and compassionate are not names of God, the reference in the mishna is to an oath in the name of God.

### Part 2
<b>Rava said to</b> Abaye: <b>If so,</b> in the case of one who administered the oath to the witnesses <b>in the</b> name of <b>heaven and in the</b> name of <b>earth as well,</b> say that it is with regard to an oath <b>in</b> the name of <b>He for Whom the heaven and the earth are His</b> that the <i>tanna</i> <b>is stating</b> the <i>halakha</i>. Why, then, does the mishna say that for an oath in the name of heaven and in the name of earth, these witnesses are exempt from liability?

### Part 3
The Gemara rejects this: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There, since there is no other entity that is called gracious and compassionate, certainly</b> it is <b>in</b> the name of <b>He Who is gracious,</b> and <b>certainly</b> it is <b>in</b> the name of <b>He Who is compassionate</b> that the <i>tanna</i> <b>is speaking.</b> By contrast, <b>here, since there are heaven and earth</b> that exist as independent entities, perhaps when he administers an oath in the name of heaven and in the name of earth, it is <b>in the</b> name of the actual <b>heaven and in the</b> name of the actual <b>earth</b> that <b>he is speaking,</b> and not in the name of He for Whom the heaven and the earth are His.

### Part 4
§ Apropos the names of God that may be erased and those that may not be erased, the Gemara discusses the details of the matter. <b>The Sages taught:</b> If <b>one wrote</b> the letters <b><i>alef lamed</i> from</b> the name <b><i>Elohim</i>,</b> or <b><i>yod heh</i> from the Tetragrammaton, this</b> pair of letters and that pair of letters <b>may not be erased.</b> But if one wrote the letters <b><i>shin dalet</i> from <i>Shaddai</i>,</b> or <b><i>alef dalet</i> from <i>Adonai</i>,</b> or <b><i>tzadi beit</i> from <i>Tzevaot</i>, this may be erased.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The word <b><i>tzevaot</i> may be erased</b> in <b>its entirety, as</b> God <b>is called <i>Tzevaot</i> only in the context of</b> the children of <b>Israel,</b> and it is not an independent name of God, <b>as it is stated: “And I shall bring forth My hosts [<i>tzivotai</i>], My people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt”</b> (Exodus 7:4). <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b>

### Part 6
<b>The Sages taught: Any</b> letters <b>ancillary to the name</b> of God, <b>whether</b> as a prefix <b>preceding</b> the name <b>or</b> as a suffix <b>succeeding</b> the name, <b>this</b> addition <b>may be erased. Preceding it, how so?</b> If one wrote the <b>Tetragrammaton</b> with the prefix <b><i>lamed</i>,</b> meaning: To the Lord, the <b><i>lamed</i> may be erased;</b> the <b>Tetragrammaton</b> with the prefix <b><i>beit</i>,</b> meaning: By the Lord, the <b><i>beit</i> may be erased;</b> the <b>Tetragrammaton</b> with the prefix <b><i>vav</i>,</b> meaning: And the Lord, the <b><i>vav</i> may be erased;</b> the <b>Tetragrammaton</b> with the prefix <b><i>mem</i>,</b> meaning: From the Lord, the <b><i>mem</i> may be erased;</b> the <b>Tetragrammaton</b> with the prefix <b><i>shin</i>,</b> meaning: That the Lord, the <b><i>shin</i> may be erased;</b> the <b>Tetragrammaton</b> with the prefix <b><i>heh</i>,</b> meaning: Is the Lord, the <b><i>heh</i> may be erased;</b> the <b>Tetragrammaton</b> with the prefix <b><i>kaf</i>,</b> meaning: Like the Lord, the <b><i>kaf</i> may be erased.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Succeeding it, how so?</b> If one wrote <b><i>Eloheinu</i>,</b> meaning: Our God, the <b><i>nun vav</i></b> suffix <b>may be erased; <i>Eloheihem</i>,</b> meaning: Their God, the <b><i>heh mem</i></b> suffix <b>may be erased; <i>Eloheikhem</i>,</b> meaning: Your God, second person plural, the <b><i>kaf mem</i></b> suffix <b>may be erased. <i>Aḥerim</i> say:</b> The suffix <b>succeeding</b> the name of God <b>may not be erased as the name</b> of God to which it is appended <b>already sanctified it</b> and it is considered as though it is part of the name. <b>Rav Huna says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b><i>Aḥerim</i>.</b>

### Part 8
§ <b>Abraham; who cursed Naboth; in Gibeah of Benjamin; Solomon; Daniel;</b> this is <b>a mnemonic</b> for the <i>halakhot</i> that follow.

### Part 9
<b>All names</b> that could be understood as the name of God <b>that are stated in the Torah with regard to Abraham</b> are <b>sacred</b> and are referring to God, <b>except for this</b> name, <b>which is non-sacred, as it is stated: “My lords, if I have found favor in your eyes”</b> (Genesis 18:3). In that passage, Abraham is addressing the angels who appeared to him in the guise of men, not God.

### Part 10
<b>Ḥanina, son of the brother of Rabbi Yehoshua, and Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya in the name of Rabbi Elazar HaModa’i, say: This too</b> is <b>sacred.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: Hospitality</b> accorded to <b>guests is greater than receiving the Divine Presence? In accordance with whose</b> opinion is that statement? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>that pair</b> of <i>tanna’im</i>, Ḥanina, son of the brother of Rabbi Yehoshua, and Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, who understood that Abraham was speaking to God.

### Part 11
<b>All names</b> that could be understood as the name of God <b>that are stated</b> in the Torah <b>with regard to Lot</b> are <b>non-sacred</b> and are referring to angels, <b>except for this</b> one, <b>which is sacred, as it is stated: “And Lot said to them: Please, not so <i>Adonai</i>. Behold your servant has found favor in your eyes,</b> and you have magnified Your mercy that You have performed for me by saving my life” (Genesis 19:18–19). It is apparent from the context that Lot is addressing <b>He Who has the capacity to kill and to vivify; that is the Holy One, Blessed be He.</b>

### Part 12
<b>All names that are stated with regard to Naboth</b> are <b>sacred,</b> e.g., in the verse: “Naboth blasphemed <i>Elohim</i> and the king” (I Kings 21:13), and those stated <b>with regard to Micah</b> are <b>non-sacred</b> and are referring to the graven image that he fashioned (see Judges, chapters 17–18). <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> Indeed, all names that are stated <b>with regard to Naboth</b> are <b>sacred;</b> but those stated <b>with regard to Micah, some of them are non-sacred and some of them are sacred.</b> The names beginning with the letters <b><i>alef lamed</i>,</b> i.e., <i>Elohim</i>, are <b>non-sacred,</b> as the reference is to the idol that he crafted, and all the names beginning with the letters <b><i>yod heh</i>,</b> i.e., the Tetragrammaton, are <b>sacred, except for this</b> name that begins with the letters <b><i>alef lamed</i> and it is sacred: “All the time that the house of <i>Elohim</i> was in Shiloh”</b> (Judges 18:31).

### Part 13
<b>All names that are stated in</b> the passage concerning <b>Gibeah of Benjamin,</b> where the rest of the tribes consulted God to determine whether they should go to war against the tribe of Benjamin (see Judges, chapter 20), <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> They are <b>non-sacred,</b> as they were consulting an idol, not God. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> They are <b>sacred.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Rabbi Eliezer said to</b> Rabbi Yehoshua: How can you say that those names are sacred? <b>Does</b> God <b>promise and not fulfill</b> the promise? Twice the tribes received the response to go to war against Benjamin, and twice they were vanquished.

### Part 15
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to</b> Rabbi Eliezer: <b>That which</b> God <b>promised, He fulfilled.</b> In each case, He responded to their question. The first time they consulted God through the <i>Urim VeTummim</i>, <b>but they did not seek to ascertain if</b> they are <b>to triumph</b> in the war or <b>if</b> they are <b>to be defeated. In the last</b> time that they consulted God through the <i>Urim VeTummim</i>, <b>where they sought to ascertain</b> whether they would emerge triumphant, <b>they consented</b> in Heaven <b>to their</b> endeavor, <b>as it is stated: “And Pinehas, son of Elazar, son of Aaron was standing before it in those days, saying: Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease?</b> And the Lord said: Go up, as tomorrow I will deliver them into your hand” (Judges 20:28).

### Part 16
<b>All</b> mentions of the name <b>Shlomo that are stated in the Song of Songs,</b> such as: “The song of songs that is Shlomo’s” (Song of Songs 1:1), are not references to King Solomon; rather, they are <b>sacred,</b> meaning <b>a song to</b> the <b>One for Whom peace [<i>shehashalom</i>] is His, except for this</b> mention: <b>“My vineyard, which is mine, is before me; you, Solomon shall have the one thousand,”</b> i.e., one thousand are <b>for Solomon himself; “and two hundred for those who guard its fruit”</b> (Song of Songs 8:12), which is a reference to <b>the Sages. And some say: This</b> verse <b>too is non-sacred: “Behold, the bed of Solomon; sixty</b> mighty men are around it” (Song of Songs 3:7).

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: Does this mean: <b>This</b> verse <b>too</b> is non-sacred, <b>and it is not necessary</b> to say that the verse cited earlier is non-sacred? <b>But that which Shmuel says: A monarchy that kills one of</b> every <b>six</b> individuals <b>in the world is not punished</b> for doing so, as that is the prerogative of a monarch, <b>as it is stated: “My vineyard, which is mine, is before me; you, Shlomo shall have the one thousand,”</b> this is a reference <b>to the monarchy of Heaven; “and two hundred for those who guard its fruit,”</b> this is a reference <b>to the monarchy of earth.</b> Of the 1,200 mentioned in the two parts of the verse, two hundred, or one-sixth, are the prerogative of the earthly monarch. <b>Shmuel,</b> who interprets the mention of Shlomo in this verse as referring to God, holds <b>neither in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i> nor in accordance with</b> the opinion introduced with the term: <b>Some say.</b> Both <i>tanna’im</i> agree that the reference in the verse is to Solomon and not to the Holy One, Blessed be He.

### Part 18
<b>Rather,</b> Shmuel cites a different version of the opinion introduced with the term: Some say, according to which <b>this</b> is what <b>it is saying. And some say: This</b> Shlomo that appears in the verse with regard to the one thousand is <b>sacred, and that</b> Shlomo that appears in the verse <b>with regard to the bed of</b> Solomon <b>is non-sacred, and</b> it is <b>Shmuel who states</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion introduced with the term: <b>Some say.</b>

### Part 19
<b>All kings that are stated with regard to Daniel</b> are <b>non-sacred, except for this</b> one, <b>which is sacred: “You, O king, king of kings, unto whom the God of heaven has given you the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the glory”</b> (Daniel 2:37).

### Part 20
<b>And some say: This too</b> is <b>sacred, as it is stated: “My Lord, the dream shall be for your enemy and its interpretation for your foe”</b> (Daniel 4:16). <b>To whom is</b> Daniel <b>saying</b> this? <b>If it enters your mind</b> that when Daniel says: “My lord,” it is <b>to Nebuchadnezzar</b> that <b>he is saying it, his enemy, who are they?</b> They are the <b>Jewish people. Would</b> Daniel <b>curse the Jewish people?</b>

### Part 21
<b>And the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> who understands that Daniel is referring to Nebuchadnezzar, <b>holds: Are there Jewish enemies</b> for Nebuchadnezzar and <b>there are no gentile enemies</b> for him? Daniel was cursing the gentile enemies, not the Jewish enemies.

### Part 22
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Or</b> if one administered the oath to the witnesses <b>in</b> the name of <b>any of the appellations</b> of God, even though he did not mention the ineffable name of God, <b>these</b> witnesses are <b>liable</b> for taking a false oath of testimony.

### Part 23
<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i> that cites the verse: <b>“The Lord shall render you as a curse and as an oath”</b> (Numbers 5:21). <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> this? <b>Isn’t it already stated</b> at the beginning of the verse: <b>“And the priest shall administer to the woman with the oath of cursing”? Due to</b> the fact <b>that it is stated</b> with regard to an oath of testimony: <b>“And he heard the voice of an <i>ala</i>”</b> (Leviticus 5:1), one may infer: <b><i>Ala</i> is stated here</b> with regard to an oath of testimony <b>and <i>ala</i> is stated there</b> with regard to a <i>sota</i>; <b>just as there,</b> with regard to a <i>sota</i>, the reference is to <b>an oath, so too here,</b> with regard to an oath of testimony, the reference is to <b>an oath.</b> And <b>just as there,</b> the oath is administered <b>in</b> the <b>name</b> of God, <b>so too here,</b> the oath is administered <b>in</b> the <b>name</b> of God. This is contrary to the mishna, where the ruling is that an oath of testimony may be administered even in the name of appellations of God.

### Part 24
<b>Abaye said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i> is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Idi,</b> and <b>that</b> mishna is the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Idi says: Since the Torah says</b> in some cases: <b>Take an oath, and</b> in some cases: <b>Do not take an oath;</b> and it says in some cases: <b>Curse, and</b> in some cases: <b>Do not curse, just as</b> when the Torah says: <b>Take an oath,</b> it is <b>in</b> the <b>name</b> of God, <b>so too,</b> when the Torah states: <b>Do not take an oath,</b> it is <b>in the name</b> of God. And <b>just as</b> when the Torah states: <b>Curse,</b> it is <b>in</b> the <b>name</b> of God, <b>so too,</b> when the Torah says: <b>Do not curse,</b> it is <b>in</b> the <b>name</b> of God.

### Part 25
The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis</b> say: <b>If they derive</b> an oath of testimony from <i>sota</i> by means of <b>a verbal analogy, let us require</b> that both an oath of testimony and the curse will be specifically in <b>the ineffable name</b> of God. <b>If they do not derive</b> an oath of testimony from <i>sota</i> by means of <b>a verbal analogy, from where do they</b> derive <b>that</b> the instance of the word <b><i>ala</i> that</b> is written with regard to an oath of testimony <b>is an oath?</b>

### Part 26
The Gemara answers: <b>They derive it from that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is written with regard to an oath of testimony: “And he hears the voice of <b>an <i>ala</i>”</b> (Leviticus 5:1); <b><i>ala</i> is nothing other than an expression</b> meaning <b>oath. And likewise it says: “And the priest shall administer to the woman with the oath of cursing [<i>ha’ala</i>]”</b> (Numbers 5:21).

### Part 27
The Gemara asks: It is not merely <i>ala</i> that is written there; <b>the oath of an <i>ala</i> is written there.</b> Apparently, <i>ala</i> alone does not mean oath. The Gemara explains that <b>this</b> is what the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying:</b> “And he hears the voice of <b>an <i>ala</i>”; <i>ala</i> is</b> used <b>only</b> when accompanied <b>by an oath. And likewise it says: “And the priest shall administer to the woman with the oath of cursing.”</b>
