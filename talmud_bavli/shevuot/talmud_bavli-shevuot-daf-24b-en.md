### Part 1
in taking the oath, <b>he granted significance to</b> the non-kosher food, and that is why his eating forbidden items is considered to be eating. <b>But here,</b> where he took an oath not to eat and then ate non-kosher food, <b>did he</b> thereby <b>give significance to it?</b> For this reason, no conclusive proof can be cited from the last case in the mishna.

### Part 2
Rabbi Yoḥanan understands the mishna as referring to a case in which the oath takes effect because it is a more inclusive prohibition than the prohibition against eating non-kosher food, in that it adds additional prohibitions for the same individual. In this context, <b>Rava says: What is the reasoning of the one who holds</b> that a more <b>inclusive prohibition</b> takes effect where there already is a prohibition in place?

### Part 3
Rava answers his own question: <b>It is just as it is</b> in the case <b>of an expanded prohibition,</b> which incorporates additional people into the list of those for whom the original item is forbidden. An expanded prohibition also takes effect despite the fact that there is already a prohibition in place.

### Part 4
<b>And</b> with regard to <b>the one who exempts</b> another from liability in the case of a more inclusive prohibition, <b>as he does not hold</b> that it takes effect, why does he hold that an expanded prohibition does take effect? <b>When he says</b> that <b>an expanded prohibition</b> takes effect, that is <b>with regard to a single piece,</b> i.e., that the number of people who are prohibited from eating the same piece of meat is expanded. <b>With regard to two</b> distinct <b>pieces,</b> i.e., a case where the new prohibition expands the scope of prohibited items, as in an inclusive prohibition, <b>we do not say</b> that it takes effect.

### Part 5
§ <b>And Rava says: According to the one who holds</b> that a more <b>inclusive prohibition</b> takes effect where another prohibition is already in place, the <i>halakha</i> should be as follows: When a person <b>says:</b> On my <b>oath I will not eat figs, and then says:</b> On my <b>oath I will not eat figs and grapes, since</b> the last oath <b>takes effect with regard to the grapes, it also takes effect with regard to the figs,</b> even though they were already forbidden by his previous oath.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious?</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>we say</b> that a more inclusive prohibition takes effect only with regard to <b>a prohibition that occurs on its own,</b> like the prohibition against eating non-kosher food, but with regard to <b>a prohibition that occurs by</b> the act of a person <b>himself we do not say</b> that the more inclusive prohibition takes effect, Rava <b>teaches us</b> that there is no difference.

### Part 8
<b>Rava, son of Rabba, raises an objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Karetot</i> 13b): <b>It is</b> possible for a person to <b>perform one</b> act of <b>eating for which</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>four sin-offerings and one guilt-offering. And these are</b> the prohibitions one can violate in this manner: <b>A ritually impure</b> person <b>who ate</b> forbidden <b>fat that is the leftover from</b> one of <b>the sacrificial</b> animals <b>on Yom Kippur.</b> If he did this and was unaware of the relevant prohibitions he is liable to bring four sin-offerings, as well as a guilt-offering for deriving benefit from the misuse of consecrated property.

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Meir says: Also, if it was Shabbat and he transferred</b> the item from one domain to another in his mouth, he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin-offering for performing labor on Shabbat as well. The Rabbis <b>said to him: This is not</b> a prohibition <b>of the</b> same <b>type,</b> since in the case of Rabbi Meir’s additional prohibition he does not violate it by eating.

### Part 10
Rava, son of Rabba, explains the objection that arises from the mishna: <b>And if it is so</b> that a more inclusive prohibition takes effect, then <b>you find</b> a case where one is liable for the violation of <b>five</b> prohibitions in one act of eating, <b>such as where</b> one <b>says</b> in the aforementioned situation: On my <b>oath I will not eat dates and</b> forbidden <b>fat. Since</b> the oath <b>takes effect with regard to the dates, it also takes effect with regard to the</b> forbidden <b>fat.</b> The fact that the mishna fails to mention such an oath indicates that a more inclusive prohibition does not take effect where another prohibition is already in place.

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: The absence of an oath with a more inclusive prohibition in the mishna does not indicate anything. <b>When</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> the scenario above, he lists only the potential <b>prohibitions that occur on their own</b> in one act of eating, but <b>he does not teach prohibitions that occur by</b> the act of the person <b>himself.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t</b> the mishna include in its list the prohibition against deriving benefit from <b>consecrated</b> property, which does not occur on its own but only when an item is consecrated?

### Part 13
The Gemara answers: The case in the mishna is that of <b>a first-born</b> animal, <b>whose sanctity is from the womb,</b> i.e., begins automatically at birth.

### Part 14
<b>If you wish, say</b> instead, in response to the question, that <b>when</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>teaches</b> it, he includes only <b>matters to which</b> presenting <b>a request</b> for dissolution <b>do not apply. An oath, to which a request</b> for dissolution <b>applies, is not taught.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>Doesn’t</b> the mishna include in its list the prohibition against deriving benefit from <b>consecrated</b> property? Consecration can be dissolved by a Sage.

### Part 16
The Gemara answers: <b>Didn’t we</b> already <b>establish</b> that the case in the mishna is that of <b>a firstborn</b> animal, whose sanctity cannot be dissolved?

### Part 17
<b>If you wish, say</b> instead that <b>when he teaches</b> that case, he lists only those prohibitions for which one is liable to bring <b>a fixed</b> sin-<b>offering.</b> If one breaks his oath he is liable to bring <b>a sliding-scale offering,</b> and the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>does not teach</b> about the liability to bring other offerings.

### Part 18
The Gemara asks: <b>Doesn’t</b> the mishna list the transgression of <b>an impure</b> person <b>who ate consecrated</b> items, i.e., the sacrificial animals mentioned in the mishna, <b>which is</b> a prohibition for which one brings <b>a sliding-scale offering?</b>

### Part 19
The Gemara answers: The mishna is referring <b>to a king</b> who eats the leftover of a sacrificial animal while impure, <b>and</b> the mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who says:</b> A ritually impure <b>king</b> who ate consecrated items <b>brings</b> a male <b>goat</b> as a sin-offering, rather than the sliding-scale offering brought by a commoner.

### Part 20
<b>Rav Ashi said</b> there is a different answer: <b>When</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> this case, he lists only <b>matters that apply</b> when one eats the <b>measure</b> of an olive-bulk, whereas the case of <b>an oath, which applies to</b> eating even <b>less than</b> the standard <b>measure, is not taught</b> in the mishna.

### Part 21
The Gemara asks: <b>Doesn’t</b> the mishna include in its list the prohibition against deriving benefit from the misuse of <b>consecrated</b> property, which applies to eating even less than an olive-bulk?

### Part 22
The Gemara answers: <b>We require</b> that one derive the <b>value of one <i>peruta</i></b> of benefit in order to be liable, so that is also a prohibition to which standard measures apply.

### Part 23
<b>And Rav Ashi of Avireya said</b> that <b>Rabbi Zeira</b> said: <b>When</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> this case, he lists only prohibitions for which <b>intentional</b> violation <b>of</b> them renders one liable to receive <b><i>karet</i>,</b> and <b>he does not teach prohibitions</b> for which <b>intentional</b> violation <b>of</b> them renders one liable to receive lashes.

### Part 24
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t</b> the <b>guilt-offering</b> for the misuse of consecrated property, which is listed in the mishna, <b>a prohibition</b> for <b>which intentional</b> violation <b>of it</b> renders one liable to receive only lashes, not <i>karet</i>? <b>And</b> nevertheless the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>teaches</b> it.
