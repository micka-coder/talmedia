### Part 1
<b>“And it was concealed,”</b> which indicates, <b>by inference, that</b> initially <b>he had been aware,</b> and nevertheless the verse continues to state: <b>“And he was aware”</b> (Leviticus 5:3). It emerges that the verse refers <b>here</b> to <b>two</b> different <b>periods of awareness,</b> one before the transgression and one afterward. But <b>if so, why</b> must <b>the verses state: “And it was concealed,” “and it was concealed,”</b> mentioning it twice? It is in order <b>to render one liable</b> both <b>for</b> a violation due to <b>a lapse of awareness of</b> the fact he was <b>ritually impure and for</b> a violation due to <b>a lapse of awareness of</b> the fact that the place he entered was actually the <b>Temple.</b> From this <i>baraita</i> it is apparent that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi agrees with Rabbi Yishmael’s opinion concerning which types of lapses of awareness render one liable to bring a sliding-scale offering.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>We have found with regard to</b> cases of one’s <b>awareness</b> of the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods <b>that</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>has</b> explained <b>his own reasoning</b> and it accords with the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael. With regard to <b>oaths, where he has not</b> explained <b>his own reasoning, from where do we</b> derive that he holds in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva? The Gemara answers: It <b>is</b> based on <b>logical reasoning.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara presents <b>another formulation</b> of the preceding comment: The Gemara asks: <b>We have found</b> an explicit statement of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>with regard to</b> cases of one’s <b>awareness</b> of the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods indicating <b>that he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael. With regard to oaths, from where do we</b> derive <b>that he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva?</b> The Gemara answers: It <b>is</b> based on <b>logical reasoning.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara explains the logical reasoning: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>Rabbi Akiva deems</b> one <b>liable</b> for oaths <b>pertaining to the past?</b> The reason is <b>that he expounds</b> verses using the method of <b>amplifications and restrictions</b> (see 26a). <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>also expounds</b> verses using the method of <b>amplifications and restrictions,</b> and consequently he arrives at the same opinion as Rabbi Akiva.

### Part 5
The Gemara demonstrates its point: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says</b> that <b>one can redeem</b> a woman’s <b>firstborn son with any</b> item worth five shekels, <b>except for</b> promissory <b>notes. And the Rabbis say</b> that <b>one can redeem</b> a woman’s <b>firstborn son with any</b> item worth five shekels, <b>except for</b> Canaanite <b>slaves,</b> promissory <b>notes, and land.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? <b>He expounds</b> verses using the method of <b>amplifications and restrictions.</b> Accordingly, he expounds the verse: “And its redemption from one month shall you redeem, according to the valuation of five silver shekels by the sacred shekel” (Numbers 18:16), as follows: Concerning the phrase: <b>“And its redemption from one month,”</b> since it does not specify that only certain items can be used for the redemption, the verse <b>amplified</b> the category of items that can be used to redeem the firstborn, intimating that many different items can be used. Then, with the phrase: <b>“According to the valuation of five silver shekels,”</b> the verse <b>restricted</b> the category to items that are similar to silver shekels. Then, with the term: <b>“Shall you redeem,”</b> the verse <b>again amplified</b> the category.

### Part 7
According to the hermeneutical principle that when a verse <b>amplified and</b> then <b>restricted and</b> then <b>amplified, it amplified</b> the relevant category to include <b>everything</b> except for the specific matter excluded in the restriction. The Gemara elaborates: <b>What</b> is included by the fact <b>it amplified?</b> Almost <b>everything. And what</b> is excluded by the fact <b>it restricted? It restricted</b> only promissory <b>notes,</b> which are the most fundamentally dissimilar to silver shekels.

### Part 8
The Gemara explains the reasoning of the Rabbis: <b>And the Rabbis expound</b> verses through the method of <b>generalizations and details.</b> Accordingly, they expound the verse as follows: The phrase: <b>“And its redemption from one month,”</b> is <b>a generalization</b> which suggests that many different items can be used to redeem the firstborn. Then, the phrase: <b>“According to the valuation of five silver shekels,”</b> is <b>a detail,</b> which suggests that only items that are similar to silver shekels can be used. Then, with the term: <b>“Shall you redeem,”</b> the verse <b>again makes a generalization.</b>

### Part 9
Based on this exegetical method, whenever a verse has <b>a generalization and</b> then <b>a detail and</b> then <b>a generalization,</b> the principle is that <b>you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail;</b> in this case, <b>just as the detail,</b> i.e., silver shekels, <b>is explicitly something that is movable and has intrinsic monetary</b> value, <b>so too, anything that is movable and has intrinsic monetary</b> value can be used. This <b>excludes land, which is not movable property;</b> it <b>excludes</b> Canaanite <b>slaves, who are</b> halakhically <b>compared to land;</b> and it <b>excludes</b> promissory <b>notes,</b> because <b>even though they are movable property, they do not have intrinsic monetary</b> value.

### Part 10
<b>Ravina said to Ameimar:</b> Does <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi really <b>expound</b> verses through the method of <b>amplifications and restrictions? But doesn’t Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>expound</b> verses through the method of <b>generalizations and details?</b>

### Part 11
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah provides the process by which a Hebrew slave who has already completed his six years of servitude may continue on as a slave of his master: “And you shall take the <b>awl</b> and put it through his ear and in the door” (Deuteronomy 15:17). From this verse, <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>an awl</b> can be used; <b>from where</b> do I know <b>to include the thorn of a palm [<i>hasol</i>], and a thorn, a needle, and a gimlet, and a stylus</b> for writing on wax, as valid tools for piercing his ear? <b>The verse states: “And you shall take,”</b> which indicates that <b>anything that can be taken by hand</b> is a valid tool. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> Not all these items can be used. Rather, since the verse specifies an <b>“awl,”</b> only items similar to an awl can be used; <b>just as an awl is distinct</b> in that it is fashioned <b>of metal, so too, anything</b> fashioned <b>of metal</b> can be used.

### Part 12
<b>And we say</b> with regard to this dispute: <b>About what do they disagree? Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>expounds</b> verses using the method of <b>generalizations and details, and Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, expounds</b> verses
