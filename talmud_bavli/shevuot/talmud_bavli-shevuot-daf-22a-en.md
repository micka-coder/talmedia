### Part 1
<b>answer that</b> which <b>Rava asks</b> with regard to one who says: On my <b>oath I will not eat, and</b> who then <b>ate dirt.</b> Rava’s question is: <b>How much</b> must he eat <b>in</b> order to be liable? Based on the Rabbis’ statement, <b>you could answer</b> that he is not liable <b>unless there is an olive-bulk</b> that he has eaten. The Gemara rejects this conclusion: <b>When we say</b> in the mishna that there are no cases where a person who eats less than a full measure is liable, <b>we say</b> it <b>with regard to items that are edible.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>But aren’t <i>konamot</i></b> an example of a case where one is liable for eating even less than an olive-bulk? The Gemara answers: <b><i>Konamot</i> are also like</b> a case where he <b>specifies</b> that any amount is forbidden for consumption.

### Part 3
§ The mishna teaches that Rabbi Akiva <b>said to</b> the Rabbis: <b>Where do we find one who speaks and</b> is liable to <b>bring an offering</b> for it, <b>as this</b> oath taker merely <b>speaks,</b> i.e., takes an oath, <b>and brings an offering</b> for it? The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> do we <b>not? But isn’t a blasphemer</b> liable to bring an offering according to the opinion of Rabbi Akiva (see <i>Karetot</i> 7a)? The Gemara answers: <b>We are speaking of one who speaks and</b> in doing so <b>generates a prohibition. And this one,</b> the blasphemer, <b>is</b> merely one who <b>speaks and sins</b> but does not bring an offering.

### Part 4
The Gemara challenges: <b>But doesn’t a nazirite</b> render wine forbidden to himself through speech, by making a vow? And he does bring an offering. The Gemara answers: <b>We are speaking of one who brings an offering</b> specifically <b>for his speaking, and this one,</b> the nazirite, <b>brings an offering</b> at the end of his naziriteship <b>in order to permit wine to himself.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara challenges: <b>But isn’t consecrated</b> property a case where one renders an item forbidden via speech alone and brings an offering for its misuse? The Gemara answers: <b>We are speaking of one who,</b> by speaking, <b>generates a prohibition for himself,</b> and nevertheless brings an offering. <b>And this one,</b> who consecrates an item, <b>generates a prohibition for the whole world.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara challenges: <b>Aren’t <i>konamot</i></b> an example of a case where one renders an item forbidden to himself by speech alone and brings an offering for using it? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Akiva <b>holds</b> that <b>there is no</b> prohibition of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property <b>with regard to <i>konamot</i>.</b>

### Part 7
§ <b>Rava says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Akiva and the Rabbis is with regard to <b>where</b> one took the oath <b>without specifying</b> that he is liable for eating any amount. <b>But</b> in a case <b>where he specifies</b> that his oath applies to any amount, <b>everyone agrees</b> that he is liable <b>for</b> eating <b>any amount. What is the reason</b> for this? <b>One who specifies</b> this renders any amount significant <b>like</b> a whole <b>entity.</b>

### Part 8
<b>And Rava says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> is with regard to a case <b>where</b> one takes an oath saying: On my oath <b>I will not eat, but</b> in a case <b>where</b> one says: On my oath <b>I will not taste, all agree</b> that he is liable <b>for</b> tasting <b>any amount.</b> The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that he is liable in that case? Tasting has no defined measure. The Gemara answers: Rava nevertheless taught it, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>even</b> if one takes an oath saying: I will not taste, he is liable only if he eats an olive-bulk, <b>as people say: To taste,</b> as a way of saying: To eat. Therefore, Rava <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case.

### Part 9
§ <b>Rav Pappa says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> in the mishna is <b>with regard to oaths, but with regard to <i>konamot</i>, all agree</b> that one is liable for eating <b>any amount. What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Indeed,</b> with regard to <b><i>konamot</i>, since</b> in the vow <b>he did not explicitly mention eating,</b> which has a defined measure, but only that the item is forbidden to him like an offering, it is <b>as if he specified</b> that he is liable for eating any amount.

### Part 10
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from that which is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: Items that are forbidden by <b>two <i>konamot</i> combine</b> to produce a full measure for which one is liable; items forbidden by <b>two oaths do not</b> so <b>combine. Rabbi Meir says:</b> Items forbidden by <b><i>konamot</i> are like</b> those forbidden by <b>oaths.</b> The Gemara explains the objection: <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that with regard to items forbidden by <i>konamot</i>, one is <b>liable for</b> eating <b>any amount, why do I</b> need them <b>to combine?</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: They combine in a case <b>where he said: Eating from this one is <i>konam</i> for me; eating from that one is <i>konam</i> for me.</b> Since he explicitly mentions eating, he is not liable unless he eats an olive-bulk. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, why do they combine to</b> produce a full measure? <b>Ultimately,</b> since he took two separate vows, <b>go to this</b> item and <b>there is not</b> a full <b>measure, and go to that</b> item and <b>there is not</b> a full <b>measure.</b> The Gemara answers: They combined to produce one full measure <b>when he said: Eating from both of them is <i>konam</i> for me.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>In the corresponding</b> situation <b>with regard to oaths, where he said:</b> On my <b>oath I will not eat from both of them, why do they not combine? Rav Pineḥas said: Oaths are different. Since</b> two items that are forbidden by a single oath <b>are distinct with regard to sin-offerings,</b> in that one is liable to bring a sin-offering for eating each one, so too eating a small amount from each <b>does not combine</b> in order to produce a full measure.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> how did <b>Rabbi Meir say</b> that items forbidden by <b><i>konamot</i> are like</b> those forbidden by <b>oaths</b> and do not combine to produce a full measure? <b>Granted that</b> items forbidden by <b>oaths</b> do not combine, <b>since they are distinct with regard to sin-offerings, but why do</b> items forbidden by <b><i>konamot</i> not</b> combine? The Gemara answers: <b>Reverse</b> the language so that the <i>baraita</i> has <b>Rabbi Meir say:</b> Items forbidden by <b>oaths are like</b> items forbidden by <b><i>konamot</i>.</b> Neither combines to produce a full measure, <b>and</b> Rabbi Meir <b>does not accept</b> the statement <b>of Rav Pineḥas</b> that items forbidden by oaths are different.

### Part 14
<b>Ravina said: When Rav Pappa says</b> that one is liable for eating any amount of an item forbidden by <i>konamot</i>, that is <b>with regard to the matter of lashes. When it is taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that items forbidden by <i>konamot</i> combine to produce a full measure, <b>that</b> is <b>with regard to the matter of an offering</b> for misuse of consecrated property, <b>where we require</b> that one derive benefit equal to the <b>value of one <i>peruta</i></b> from the forbidden item.

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: Is that <b>to say that the Sages hold</b> that the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property extend <b>to</b> items forbidden by <b><i>konamot</i>? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one said: <b>This loaf is consecrated, and</b> subsequently <b>ate it,</b> then <b>either he or another</b> who ate it is liable for <b>misusing</b> consecrated property; <b>consequently,</b> since the loaf is consecrated, <b>it is subject to redemption.</b> If one said: <b>This loaf is</b> forbidden <b>to me</b> as if it were <b>consecrated,</b> i.e., it is <i>konam</i> for me, and then he ate it, <b>he</b> is liable for <b>misusing</b> consecrated property, but <b>another</b> is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misusing</b> consecrated property; <b>consequently,</b> since the loaf is not fully consecrated, <b>it is not subject to redemption.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>
