### Part 1
They atone <b>for a ritually pure</b> person <b>who</b> unwittingly <b>partook of ritually impure</b> sacrificial food.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> With regard to <b>all the goats</b> offered as additional offerings, those of the New Moons, Festivals, and Yom Kippur, <b>their atonement,</b> i.e., the atonement that they effect, <b>is the same;</b> they all atone <b>for</b> the <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple</b> by entering it while impure, <b>or</b> for the defiling of <b>its sacrificial</b> foods by partaking of them while impure.

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Shimon would say,</b> delineating his opinion as the mishna expresses it above: The <b>goats of</b> the <b>New Moons atone for a ritually pure</b> person <b>who</b> unwittingly <b>partook of ritually impure</b> sacrificial food. <b>And</b> with regard to the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods, the goats <b>of</b> the <b>Festivals atone for</b> cases <b>in which</b> one <b>did not have awareness, neither at the beginning nor at the end, and</b> the goats of the additional offerings <b>of Yom Kippur atone for</b> cases <b>in which</b> one <b>did not have awareness at the beginning but did have awareness at the end.</b>

### Part 4
The Rabbis <b>said to him: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>whether</b> goats consecrated for different days <b>may be sacrificed, this</b> one <b>in</b> place of <b>that</b> one? For example, if a goat was initially consecrated to be sacrificed as part of the Yom Kippur additional offerings, may it be sacrificed as part of the Festival additional offerings instead? Rabbi Shimon <b>said to them: They may be sacrificed. They said to him: Since,</b> according to you, <b>their atonement is not the same, how could they</b> possibly <b>be sacrificed, this</b> one <b>in</b> place of <b>that</b> one? Rabbi Shimon <b>said to them:</b> They can be interchanged, since ultimately <b>all of them come to atone for</b> the <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods.

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of</b> Rabbi Shimon a tradition of his opinion that differs from the way the mishna expresses it above: The <b>goats of</b> the <b>New Moons atone for a ritually pure</b> person <b>who</b> unwittingly <b>partook of ritually impure</b> sacrificial food. The goats <b>of</b> the <b>Festivals exceed them, as they atone</b> both <b>for a pure</b> person <b>who partook of impure</b> sacrificial food <b>and</b> also <b>for</b> cases of defiling the Temple or its sacrificial foods <b>in which</b> one <b>did not have awareness, neither at the beginning nor at the end.</b>

### Part 6
The goats <b>of Yom Kippur</b> further <b>exceed them, as they atone</b> both <b>for a ritually pure</b> person <b>who partook of ritually impure</b> sacrificial food <b>and for</b> cases of defiling the Temple or its sacrificial foods <b>in which</b> one <b>did not have awareness, neither at the beginning nor at the end; and</b> they also atone <b>for</b> cases <b>in which</b> one <b>did not have awareness at the beginning but did have awareness at the end.</b>

### Part 7
The Rabbis <b>said to him: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>whether</b> goats consecrated for different days <b>may be sacrificed, this</b> one <b>in</b> place of <b>that</b> one? Rabbi Shimon <b>said to them: Yes,</b> they can be interchanged. <b>They said to him: If</b> what you say is <b>so,</b> granted that the goats <b>of Yom Kippur may be sacrificed on</b> the <b>New Moons, but how could</b> the goats <b>of</b> the <b>New Moons be sacrificed on Yom Kippur</b> when they will need <b>to effect atonement</b> for <b>that which they were not</b> consecrated <b>for?</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>said to them:</b> They can all be interchanged, since ultimately <b>all of them come to atone for</b> the <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods, even if each one atones for a different case.

### Part 8
ยง <b>And for</b> the <b>intentional defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods, both the <b>goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary on Yom Kippur, <b>and Yom Kippur</b> itself, <b>atone.</b>

### Part 9
The mishna delineates how atonement is effected for other transgressions: <b>For</b> all <b>other transgressions that are</b> stated <b>in the Torah,</b> whether they are <b>the minor</b> ones <b>or the major</b> ones, whether they were <b>intentional or unwitting,</b> whether <b>one became aware</b> of them before Yom Kippur <b>or did not become aware</b> of them until after Yom Kippur, whether they involve <b>a positive mitzva or a prohibition,</b> whether the transgressors are subject to <b>excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>] or</b> to one of the <b>court</b>-imposed <b>death penalties,</b> the <b>scapegoat</b> sent to Azazel on Yom Kippur <b>atones.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Israelites and priests and</b> the <b>anointed priest,</b> i.e., the High Priest, achieve atonement from the scapegoat equally. <b>What</b> is the difference <b>between Israelites, priests, and</b> the <b>anointed priest?</b> The difference is <b>only that the priests achieve atonement for</b> their <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods through <b>the bull</b> that the High Priest offers on Yom Kippur, whereas the Israelites achieve atonement for defiling caused by them through the goats that are sacrificed on Yom Kippur.

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> With regard to the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods, <b>just as</b> the <b>blood of the goat, whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary, <b>atones for Israelites, so</b> too, the <b>blood of the bull</b> of the High Priest, whose blood presentation is also performed inside the Sanctuary, <b>atones for the priests.</b> And for all other transgressions, <b>just as</b> the <b>confession</b> made <b>over the scapegoat atones for Israelites, so</b> too, the <b>confession</b> made <b>over</b> the <b>bull atones for the priests.</b>

### Part 12
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara inquires: <b>Now, the <i>tanna</i> is leaving</b> tractate <b><i>Makkot</i>,</b> the tractate that precedes tractate <i>Shevuot</i> in the mishnaic order. <b>What is distinctive</b> about tractate <i>Shevuot</i> <b>that he teaches</b> tractate <b><i>Shevuot</i></b> after tractate <i>Makkot</i>? The Gemara answers: It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that he teaches</b> in a mishna at the end of tractate <i>Makkot</i> (20a): <b>For</b> rounding the edges of his <b>head</b> one is <b>liable</b> to receive <b>two</b> sets of lashes: <b>One from here,</b> the hair adjacent to one ear, <b>and one from there,</b> the hair adjacent to the other ear.
