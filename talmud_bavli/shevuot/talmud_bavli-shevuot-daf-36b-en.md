### Part 1
<b>Rather,</b> nevertheless, <b>reverse</b> the attribution of the opinions in the mishna and say that Rabbi Meir deems the witness exempt from liability for an oath of testimony, as <b>even in ritual matters,</b> Rabbi Meir <b>does not accept</b> the principle: From a negative statement you can infer a positive statement.

### Part 2
<b>Ravina objects to this: And in ritual matters,</b> does Rabbi Meir <b>not accept</b> the principle? <b>But if that is so,</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> that priests who perform the Temple service while <b>intoxicated with wine, and</b> priests who perform the Temple service with <b>overgrown</b> hair on their <b>head, who,</b> based on this principle, are liable to receive <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven, <b>so too does Rabbi Meir not accept</b> this principle? <b>But didnâ€™t we learn</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And these</b> are they <b>who</b> are liable <b>to</b> receive <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven: Priests who perform the Temple service while <b>intoxicated with wine and</b> priests who perform the Temple service with <b>overgrown</b> hair on their <b>head,</b> and Rabbi Meir does not disagree with that ruling?

### Part 3
<b>Rather, actually reverse</b> the attribution of the opinions in the mishna and say that Rabbi Meir deems the witness exempt from liability for an oath of testimony. <b>When</b> Rabbi Meir <b>does not accept</b> that principle, it is only <b>in</b> cases involving <b>monetary matters; but in</b> cases involving <b>ritual matters, he accepts</b> the principle. That is the reason he does not dispute the <i>halakha</i> in the <i>baraita</i> with regard to a priest intoxicated with wine or with overgrown hair on his head. <b>And</b> the reason that he does not accept the principle: From a negative statement you can infer a positive statement, in the case of <i>sota</i> is that <b><i>sota</i> is different because it is a ritual matter in which there are</b> ramifications involving <b>monetary matters,</b> i.e., payment of the marriage contract. The same is true with regard to an oath of testimony in the mishna; although it is a ritual matter, it is a ritual matter with ramifications involving monetary matters.
