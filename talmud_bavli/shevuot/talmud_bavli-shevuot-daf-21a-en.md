### Part 1
it <b>teaches us as</b> Abaye <b>answers him</b> below.

### Part 2
The Gemara offers an alternative resolution of the difficulty posed by the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And if you wish, say</b> that the assertion of the <i>baraita</i> that the prohibitions against taking an oath in vain and taking a false oath are one means: <b>Just as one brings an offering for</b> taking <b>a false</b> oath, <b>so one brings an offering for</b> taking an oath <b>in vain. And this</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who deems</b> one <b>liable</b> to bring an offering for taking an oath in vain that refers <b>to the past,</b> just <b>as</b> for taking a false oath that refers <b>to the future.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s distinction between a false oath and an oath taken in vain from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Which</b> oath <b>is an oath</b> taken <b>in vain?</b> It is when <b>one takes an oath to deny that which is known to people</b> to be true. And <b>a false oath</b> is when one <b>takes an oath</b> that <b>contradicts</b> the past. The Gemara answers: <b>Say,</b> i.e., emend the <i>baraita</i> to say, that a false oath is when one <b>takes an oath and</b> subsequently <b>contradicts</b> it by acting otherwise.

### Part 4
§ <b>When Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he reported that <b>Rabbi Yirmeya says</b> that <b>Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If one takes an oath, saying: <b>I ate,</b> or: <b>I did not eat,</b> it is <b>a false</b> oath if it is not true. <b>And its prohibition</b> in the Torah is <b>from:</b> “And <b>you shall not take an oath by My name falsely,</b> so that you profane the name of your God; I am the Lord” (Leviticus 19:12). If one takes an oath, saying: <b>I will eat, or: I will not eat,</b> and breaks his oath, he <b>violates</b> the prohibition: “When a man vows a vow to the Lord, or takes an oath to bind his soul with a bond, <b>he shall not break his word”</b> (Numbers 30:3). <b>And which</b> oath is <b>an oath</b> taken <b>in vain?</b> It is when one <b>takes an oath to deny that which is known to people</b> to be true.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Pappa said: This</b> statement <b>of Rabbi Abbahu,</b> i.e., conveying the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>was not stated explicitly</b> by Rabbi Abbahu; <b>rather, it was stated by inference.</b> It was inferred from <b>that</b> which <b>Rav Idi bar Avin says</b> that <b>Rav Amram says</b> that <b>Rav Yitzḥak says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili:</b> With regard to <b>any prohibition in the Torah,</b> if it is a <b>prohibition that involves an action, one is flogged for</b> violating <b>it. But</b> with regard to a prohibition <b>that does not involve an action,</b> one <b>is not flogged</b> for violating it, except in the cases of one who <b>takes an oath, and</b> one who <b>substitutes</b> a different animal for one that is consecrated to be sacrificed (see Leviticus 27:10), <b>and</b> one who curses <b>another using the</b> Divine <b>Name</b> (see Leviticus 19:14).

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that one who <b>takes an oath</b> that is not true is flogged? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: The verse states: “You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain; for</b> the Lord <b>will not absolve of guilt</b> he that takes His name in vain” (Exodus 20:7). It is the <b>heavenly court</b> that <b>does not absolve him; but the earthly court flogs him, and</b> in doing so, <b>absolves him of guilt.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: Perhaps this</b> is what <b>the Merciful One is saying: He will not be absolved of guilt at all.</b> Abaye answered: <b>If it were written: For he will not be absolved of guilt,</b> it would be <b>as you say. Now that it is written: “For the Lord will not absolve of guilt,”</b> the verse teaches that <b>it is the Lord Who will not absolve</b> one who takes His name in vain; <b>but the earthly court flogs him, and</b> in doing so <b>absolves him of guilt.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>We found</b> a source for receiving lashes for <b>an oath</b> taken <b>in vain,</b> despite the fact that no physical action was performed. <b>From where do we</b> derive that this is also the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a false oath? Rabbi Yoḥanan himself said:</b> The verse states: <b>“In vain…in vain,” twice. If</b> the second mention <b>is not</b> necessary for the <b>matter of an oath</b> taken <b>in vain,</b> since it was already stated, <b>apply it</b> to the <b>matter of a false oath.</b>

### Part 9
<b>And Rabbi Abbahu discusses this:</b> With regard to <b>this false oath</b> referred to by Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>what are the circumstances</b> under which one who takes it is flogged? <b>If we say</b> it is when he says: On my <b>oath I will not eat, and</b> he then <b>ate, that is a prohibition that involves an action. And</b> if one would <b>rather</b> say <b>that he says:</b> On my <b>oath I will eat, and he does not eat, is</b> one who breaks his oath like <b>that flogged? But wasn’t</b> it <b>stated</b> that with regard to one who says: On my <b>oath I will eat this loaf today, and the day passed and he did not eat it, Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish both say he is not flogged?</b>

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says he is not flogged because it is a prohibition that does not involve an action, and</b> concerning <b>any prohibition that does not involve an action, one is not flogged for</b> violating <b>it. And Reish Lakish says he is not flogged because</b> his violation of the prohibition necessarily involves <b>an uncertain forewarning, and an uncertain forewarning is not considered a forewarning</b> at all. Only if one is forewarned immediately prior to violating a prohibition does he receive lashes. Since not fulfilling his oath is a sin of omission, whenever the forewarning is offered, it remains uncertain whether one will fulfill the oath or not.

### Part 11
In response to his own question, <b>Rabbi Abbahu says:</b> The case where one who takes a false oath is flogged <b>will be where</b> he takes an oath saying: <b>I ate, or: I did not eat.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about oaths relating to the past, for which one is liable to receive lashes even though he did not perform an action, and oaths relating to the future that one violates by omission, and for which one is therefore exempt from lashes according to Rabbi Yoḥanan because it is a prohibition that does not involve an action? <b>Rava said: The Torah explicitly extended</b> the liability to receive lashes to one who takes <b>a false oath</b> that <b>is similar to an oath</b> taken <b>in vain. Just as</b> an oath taken <b>in vain</b> refers <b>to the past, so too,</b> one is liable for <b>a false</b> oath that refers <b>to the past.</b> This discussion of Rabbi Abbahu’s is the source of his inference as to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan mentioned by Rav Pappa.

### Part 12
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Abbahu</b> from a mishna (27b): If one says: On my <b>oath I will not eat this loaf,</b> and then says: On my <b>oath I will not eat it,</b> and then again: On my <b>oath I will not eat it, and he</b> subsequently <b>ate it, he is liable only once. This is the oath on an utterance for which</b> one who violates the prohibition <b>intentionally is liable</b> to receive <b>lashes and</b> one who violates it <b>unwittingly</b> is liable to bring <b>a sliding-scale offering.</b>

### Part 13
Rabbi Yirmeya asks: When the mishna says: <b>This is</b> the oath on an utterance, it is <b>to exclude what? Is it not to exclude</b> the case of one who takes an oath relating to the past, saying: <b>I ate, or: I did not eat,</b> thereby indicating <b>that he is not flogged?</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara responds: <b>No.</b> It serves <b>to exclude</b> one who takes an oath saying: <b>I ate, or: I did not eat, from</b> liability to bring <b>an offering.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>This is</b> the oath on an utterance <b>for which</b> one who violates <b>it unwittingly</b> is liable to bring <b>a sliding-scale offering. But</b> if one takes an oath saying: <b>I ate, or: I did not eat,</b> then <b>no,</b> one does not bring an offering. <b>And this is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, who says: One is liable</b> to bring an offering <b>only for</b> breaking oaths relating to <b>the future, but one is flogged</b> even for false oaths relating to the past.
