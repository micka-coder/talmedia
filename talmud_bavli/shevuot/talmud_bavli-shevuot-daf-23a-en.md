### Part 1
<b>And</b> since the Hebrew word <b><i>tirosh</i></b> mentioned in the verse <b>is wine, and it is written</b> with regard to it: <b>“And you shall eat,”</b> this indicates that drinking is an activity included in eating.

### Part 2
The Gemara challenges: <b>But perhaps</b> the verse is referring to consuming wine <b>by means of an <i>anigeron</i>, as Rabba bar Shmuel says: <i>Anigeron</i></b> is <b>a stew of beet greens</b> and wine, and <b><i>aksigeron</i></b> is a <b>stew of all types of cooked</b> vegetables. If so, the wine in the verse is not drunk but eaten.

### Part 3
<b>Rather, Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said:</b> Cite <b>from here,</b> a verse written with regard to money with which one has redeemed second tithe: <b>“And you shall bestow the money for whatsoever your soul desires, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine [<i>uvayyayin</i>], or for strong drink,</b> or for whatsoever your soul asks of you; and you shall eat there before the Lord your God, and you shall rejoice, you and your household” (Deuteronomy 14:26). The Hebrew word <b><i>yayin</i></b> mentioned in the verse <b>is wine, and it is written: “And you shall eat.”</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara challenges: <b>But perhaps here</b> this verse is <b>also</b> referring to consuming wine <b>by means of an <i>anigeron</i>.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara rejects this: <b>“Strong drink” is written</b> in the verse, referring to <b>something intoxicating,</b> and wine mixed into a stew is not intoxicating.

### Part 6
The Gemara challenges: <b>But perhaps</b> the intoxicating substance referred to in the verse is pressed <b>figs from Ke’ila, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A priest who <b>ate</b> pressed <b>figs from Ke’ila or drank honey or milk and</b> then <b>entered the Temple and performed</b> the sacrificial rites is <b>liable</b> for violating the prohibition against conducting the Temple service while intoxicated.

### Part 7
<b>Rather,</b> one <b>derives</b> the meaning of <b>“strong drink”</b> in this verse by means of a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the verse about <b>a nazirite:</b> “He shall abstain from wine and <b>strong drink:</b> He shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat fresh grapes or dried” (Numbers 6:3). <b>Just as there,</b> the strong drink that is forbidden to the nazirite is referring to a type of <b>wine, so too here,</b> the verse is referring to <b>wine.</b>

### Part 8
§ <b>Rava said: We learn</b> in the mishna <b>as well</b> that drinking is included in eating. The mishna teaches: If one said: On my <b>oath I will not eat, and</b> then he <b>ate and drank, he is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> offering. <b>Granted, if you say</b> that <b>drinking is included in eating,</b> that is why <b>it was necessary for the <i>tanna</i> to teach us that he is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> offering. <b>But if you say</b> that <b>drinking is not included in eating,</b> there is no reason for the <i>tanna</i> to teach that it is only one violation. If one says: On my <b>oath I will not eat, and he ate and performed</b> some kind of <b>labor, would it be necessary to teach us that</b> the person is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> offering? He never took an oath prohibiting labor.

### Part 9
<b>Abaye said to him: What, rather,</b> is your conclusion; that <b>drinking is included in eating? Say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: If he said: On my <b>oath I will not eat and I will not drink, and</b> then he <b>ate and drank,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>two</b> offerings. According to you, Rava, <b>once he said: I will not eat, drinking became forbidden to him,</b> so <b>when he said: I will not drink, why</b> is he rendered <b>liable</b> to bring a separate offering? <b>If he had said: I will not drink, two times, would he be liable</b> to bring <b>two</b> offerings?

### Part 10
Rava <b>said to him: There,</b> in the mishna, it is actually a case <b>where he said: I will not drink, and then said: I will not eat.</b> Although <b>it is</b> so <b>that drinking is included in eating, it is not</b> so that <b>eating is included in drinking,</b> and the oath not to drink went into effect independently of the oath not to eat. Therefore, he is liable to bring two offerings.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to this, if <b>he said:</b> On my <b>oath I will not eat and I will not drink, and he</b> then <b>ate and drank, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Is it that <b>he is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> offering? <b>If that is so, rather than teaching</b> in <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna that one who said: On my <b>oath I will not eat, and</b> then <b>ate and drank, is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> offering, <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach</b> the following: If one says: On my <b>oath I will not eat and I will not drink,</b> and he ate and drank, <b>he is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> offering. From that ruling it could be concluded that when one takes an oath: <b>I will not eat, alone, all the more so</b> is he liable to bring only one offering.

### Part 12
<b>Rather,</b> the mishna <b>actually</b> is <b>as it is taught,</b> that one who took an oath not to eat and drink, and then ate and drank, is liable to bring two offerings, even though drinking is included in eating. <b>And here</b> it <b>is different. Since he said: I will not eat, and then said: I will not drink, he revealed his intention that the eating that he stated</b> first <b>is eating alone</b> and does not include drinking.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Ashi said: The mishna is also precisely</b> formulated in accordance with the opinion of Shmuel that drinking is included in eating. It teaches: If he said: On my <b>oath I will not eat, and he ate foods that are inedible or drank liquids that are not potable,</b> he is <b>exempt. But</b> if those liquids were <b>fit</b> for consumption, he would be <b>liable. And why?</b> The mishna teaches that he took an oath <b>saying:</b> On my <b>oath I will not eat,</b> without mentioning drinking, which indicates that drinking is included in eating.

### Part 14
The Gemara rejects this: <b>Perhaps</b> the mishna is referring to a case <b>where he said both:</b> On my <b>oath I will not eat</b> and: On my <b>oath I will not drink.</b> The mishna did not spell out the second oath because its primary interest was in teaching that eating or drinking that which is inedible or not potable is not considered eating or drinking.

### Part 15
§ The mishna teaches that if one said: On my <b>oath I will not eat, and</b> then he <b>ate wheat bread</b> and barley bread and spelt bread, he is liable to bring only one offering. If he said: On my oath I will not eat wheat bread or barley bread or spelt bread, and then he ate all of them, he is liable to bring an offering for each one. The Gemara challenges: <b>But perhaps</b> when he details each type of bread it <b>comes to</b> ensure that he <b>exempts himself from</b> having <b>other</b> foods included in the oath, not to indicate that each type of bread is a separate oath.

### Part 16
The Gemara answers: If that was his intention, then <b>he could have</b> just <b>said: Wheat, barley, and spelt,</b> without mentioning bread each time. From the fact that he mentioned bread each time, it can be understood that his intention was that each be considered a separate oath. The Gemara rejects this: <b>But</b> if he did not mention bread, <b>perhaps</b> his oath could be interpreted <b>to</b> prohibit <b>chewing [<i>lakhos</i>]</b> whole kernels of these grains, and he consequently mentioned bread to limit the oath to bread.

### Part 17
The Gemara suggests: If his intention was to ensure that his oath does not extend to other foods, <b>he could have</b> just <b>said: Bread</b> made from <b>wheat, or barley, or spelt,</b> and in that way his oath would be limited to just bread. The Gemara rejects this: If he had said it that way, <b>perhaps</b> his oath could be interpreted to prohibit him from <b>eating wheat bread</b> and from <b>chewing</b> whole kernels of <b>barley or spelt.</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara suggests: If his intention was to ensure that his oath does not extend to other foods, <b>he could have</b> just <b>said: Bread</b> made from <b>wheat, and from barley, and from spelt,</b> thereby limiting his oath to types of bread.
