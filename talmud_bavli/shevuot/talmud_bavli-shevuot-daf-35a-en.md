### Part 1
The Gemara answers: <b>For that</b> reason, <b>the Merciful One writes</b> the verse with regard to an oath of <b>testimony near</b> the verse with regard to <b>an oath on an utterance and near</b> the verse with regard to <b>the defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods, <b>as in all of</b> those passages <b>it is stated concerning them: “And it is hidden,” and here,</b> with regard to an oath of testimony, <b>it is not stated concerning them: And it is hidden.</b> The Torah did so to underscore the contrast between them and <b>to deem liable</b> one who takes <b>an intentional</b> false oath of testimony <b>like</b> one who takes <b>an unwitting</b> false oath of testimony.

### Part 2
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one said to witnesses: <b>I administer an oath to you</b> concerning your refusal to testify <b>if you do not come and testify on my behalf that so-and-so said</b> he is going <b>to give me two hundred dinars and he did not give</b> them to me, and they take false oaths that they have no knowledge of the matter, <b>they are exempt</b> from liability to bring an offering for taking a false oath of testimony, <b>as one is liable</b> for taking a false oath of testimony <b>only</b> in a case involving <b>a monetary claim like a deposit</b> in the sense that were the witnesses to testify, the individual would be liable to pay. In the case of a promise to give a gift he could claim that he merely reconsidered.

### Part 3
If one said to witnesses: <b>I administer an oath to you that when you will know testimony</b> relevant <b>to me you will come and testify on my behalf, these</b> witnesses <b>are exempt</b> from liability for taking a false oath of testimony even if they do not testify, <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that the oath preceded</b> their knowledge of the relevant <b>testimony.</b>

### Part 4
If one <b>stood in the synagogue and said</b> for all to hear: <b>I administer an oath to you that if you know testimony</b> relevant <b>to me you will come and testify on my behalf, these</b> witnesses <b>are exempt until he directs</b> his demand <b>to</b> specific individuals.

### Part 5
If <b>one said to two</b> people: <b>I administer an oath to you, so-and-so and so-and-so, that if you know testimony</b> relevant <b>to me you will come and testify on my behalf,</b> and they respond: On our <b>oath we do not know</b> any <b>testimony</b> relevant <b>to you, and they know testimony</b> relevant <b>to him,</b> not based on an incident they witnessed but based on <b>hearsay testimony,</b> which is not valid testimony, <b>or</b> if <b>one of</b> the witnesses <b>is found</b> to be <b>a relative or disqualified, these</b> witnesses <b>are exempt</b> from liability for taking a false oath of testimony because they are unfit witnesses.

### Part 6
If the plaintiff <b>sent</b> the demand for their testimony <b>by means of his slave, or</b> in a case <b>where the defendant said to</b> the witnesses: <b>I administer an oath to you that if you know</b> any <b>testimony</b> relevant <b>to</b> the plaintiff <b>that you will come and testify on his behalf,</b> and they took a false oath that they have no knowledge of the matter, <b>these</b> witnesses <b>are exempt</b> from liability for taking a false oath of testimony <b>until they will hear</b> the demand to testify directly <b>from the mouth of the plaintiff.</b>

### Part 7
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara cites proof for the <i>halakhot</i> in the mishna from verses in the Torah. <b>The Sages taught: I administer an oath to you</b> concerning your refusal to testify <b>if you do not come and testify on my behalf that so-and-so said</b> that he is going <b>to give me two hundred dinars and he did not give</b> them to me; in such a case one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they would be liable.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> the term <b>“shall sin”</b> with regard to an oath of testimony and <b>“shall sin”</b> with regard to an oath on a deposit in order <b>to</b> derive <b>a verbal analogy.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Here, it is stated</b> with regard to an oath of testimony <b>“shall sin”</b> (Leviticus 5:1), <b>and there, it is stated</b> with regard to an oath on a deposit <b>“shall sin”</b> (Leviticus 5:21). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to an oath on a deposit, the verse is speaking only <b>with regard to a monetary claim and</b> in a case where the plaintiff <b>has</b> a legitimate claim, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to an oath of testimony, the verse is speaking only <b>with regard to a monetary claim and</b> in a case where the plaintiff <b>has</b> a legitimate claim. In the case cited in the <i>baraita</i> and in the first clause of the mishna, the plaintiff does not have a legitimate claim.

### Part 9
The mishna teaches: <b>I administer an oath to you that when you will know testimony</b> relevant <b>to me</b> you will come and testify on my behalf.

### Part 10
<b>The Sages taught: I administer an oath to you that when you will know testimony</b> relevant <b>to me you will come and testify on my behalf;</b> in such a case one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they would be liable.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And he heard the voice of an oath and he is a witness or he saw or he knew”</b> (Leviticus 5:1). One is liable to bring an offering for a false oath only in a case <b>where</b> knowledge of the <b>testimony preceded the oath, and not</b> in a case <b>where the oath preceded</b> knowledge of the <b>testimony.</b>

### Part 11
The mishna continues: If one <b>stood in the synagogue and said</b> for all to hear: <b>I administer an oath to you</b> that if you know testimony relevant to me you will come and testify on my behalf, these witnesses are exempt. <b>Shmuel says:</b> That is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> if <b>his witnesses</b> were <b>among the</b> people in the synagogue.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: Isn’t this <b>obvious?</b> Otherwise, there would be no novel element in this <i>halakha</i> of the mishna. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to cite this case only in a situation <b>where he is standing</b> right <b>next to</b> those witnesses. <b>Lest you say he is comparable to one who spoke to them</b> directly and those witnesses would be liable, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that until he specifies to whom he is directing his demand, he does not render those witnesses obligated to take an oath of testimony.

### Part 13
The Gemara notes: <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one saw a group of people standing, and his witnesses</b> were <b>among them, and he said to</b> the entire group: <b>I administer an oath to you that if you know testimony</b> relevant <b>to me you will come and testify on my behalf,</b> in such a case one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they would be liable. The verse states: “And he is a witness”</b> (Leviticus 5:1), <b>and</b> in this case <b>he did not specify his witnesses;</b> therefore, they are not liable. One <b>might</b> have thought that the <i>halakha</i> is the same <b>even</b> if <b>he said:</b> I administer an oath to <b>everyone who is standing here</b> that you will come and testify on my behalf. <b>The verse states: “And he is a witness”</b> (Leviticus 5:1), <b>and</b> in this case, although he spoke to a group, <b>he specified his witnesses;</b> therefore, they are liable.

### Part 14
The mishna teaches that if <b>one said to two</b> individuals: <b>I administer an oath to you,</b> and they know testimony relevant to him based on hearsay, or if one of the witnesses is found to be a relative or disqualified, they are exempt. The Gemara cites that which <b>the Sages taught:</b> If <b>one said to two</b> individuals: <b>I administer an oath to you, so-and-so and so-and-so,</b> that <b>if you know testimony</b> relevant <b>to me you will come and testify on my behalf, and they know testimony</b> relevant <b>to him</b> based on <b>hearsay testimony, or</b> if <b>one of</b> the witnesses is <b>a relative or disqualified,</b> in such a case one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they would be liable. The verse states: “If he does not state it, then he shall bear his iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 5:1), teaching that it is <b>with regard to</b> those <b>eligible for</b> the <b>statement</b> of testimony that <b>the verse is speaking,</b> not those who are ineligible.

### Part 15
The mishna teaches: If the plaintiff <b>sent</b> the demand for their testimony <b>by means of his slave, etc. The Sages taught:</b> If the plaintiff <b>sent</b> the demand for their testimony <b>by means of his slave, or</b> in a case <b>where the defendant said to</b> the witnesses: <b>I administer an oath to you that if you know</b> any <b>testimony</b> relevant <b>to</b> the plaintiff <b>that you will come and testify on his behalf, might</b> one have thought that <b>they would be liable? The verse states: “If he does not state it, then he shall bear his iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 5:1); therefore, they are not liable.

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the</b> biblical <b>derivation</b> that leads to that conclusion? <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> The derivation is based on the fact that it <b>is written: <i>Im lo yaggid</i>.</b> In the verse the word <i>lo</i> is spelled <i>lamed</i>, <i>vav</i>, <i>alef</i> and interpreted as both “not,” spelled <i>lamed alef</i>, and “to him,” spelled <i>lamed vav</i>. It is derived: <b>If</b> the witness who knows the testimony <b>does not state</b> it <b>to</b> the plaintiff, <b>he shall bear his iniquity,</b> and he is liable; <b>but if he does not state</b> it <b>to another,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b>

### Part 17
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna discusses the formula of an oath of testimony. If the plaintiff said to the witnesses: <b>I administer an oath to you</b> concerning your refusal to testify if you do not come and testify on my behalf, or even if he said: <b>I command you,</b> or <b>I bind you,</b> although he did not employ an unequivocal formula of an oath, <b>these</b> witnesses <b>are liable</b> for taking a false oath of testimony.

### Part 18
If one administered the oath to the witnesses <b>in the</b> name of <b>heaven and in the</b> name of <b>earth, these</b> witnesses are <b>exempt</b> from liability for taking a false oath of testimony, as that is not an oath in the name of God. If one administered the oath to the witnesses <b>in</b> the name of <b><i>alef dalet</i>,</b> i.e., <i>Adonai</i>; <b>in</b> the name of <b><i>yod heh</i>,</b> the Tetragrammaton; <b>in</b> the name of the <b>Almighty [<i>Shaddai</i>]; in</b> the name of the Lord of <b>Hosts [<i>Tzevaot</i>]; in</b> the name of the <b>Gracious and Compassionate</b> One; <b>in</b> the name of He Who is <b>Slow to Anger; in</b> the name of He Who is <b>Abounding in Loving-kindness; or in</b> the name of <b>any of the appellations</b> of God, even though he did not mention the ineffable name of God, <b>these</b> witnesses are <b>liable</b> for taking a false oath of testimony.

### Part 19
<b>One who curses</b> God <b>employing any of</b> these names or appellations of God is <b>liable</b> to be executed through stoning; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis deem</b> him <b>exempt,</b> as they hold that one is liable for cursing God only if he employs the ineffable name of God.

### Part 20
<b>One who curses his father or his mother employing any of</b> these names or appellations of God is <b>liable</b> to be executed through stoning; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis deem</b> him <b>exempt,</b> as they hold that one is liable for cursing his father and his mother only if he employs the ineffable name of God.

### Part 21
<b>One who curses himself or another employing any of</b> these names or appellations of God <b>violates a prohibition.</b> If one says: <b>The Lord God shall strike you</b> (see Deuteronomy 28:22), <b>and likewise</b> if one says: <b>God shall strike you</b> if you do not come to testify, <b>that is a curse that is written in the Torah,</b> and in such a case one is certainly liable if he fails to testify.

### Part 22
If one says to the witnesses: God <b>shall not strike you, or:</b> God <b>shall bless you, or:</b> God <b>shall benefit you</b> if you come and testify, <b>Rabbi Meir deems</b> him <b>liable,</b> as one may infer from that statement that if he fails to testify God will strike him, or will not bless or benefit him. <b>And the Rabbis deem</b> him <b>exempt</b> because the curse is not explicitly stated.

### Part 23
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that if the plaintiff said to the witnesses: <b>I administer an oath to you,</b> I command you, or I bind you, these witnesses are liable for taking a false oath of testimony. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the plaintiff <b>saying?</b> He merely said that he is administering an oath, but he did not say in the name of what he is administering the oath. <b>Rav Yehuda said: This</b> is what the plaintiff <b>is saying: I administer an oath to you with the oath mentioned in the Torah, I command you with the command mentioned in the Torah, I bind you with the bond mentioned in the Torah,</b> and in the Torah all of these include mention of the name of God.

### Part 24
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yehuda: <b>But</b> according to that interpretation, concerning <b>that which Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches,</b> that if the plaintiff said to the witnesses: <b>I chain you, these</b> witnesses are <b>liable</b> for taking a false oath of testimony, <b>is chaining written in the Torah?</b> Apparently, the reference in the mishna and the <i>baraita</i> is not to similar language in the Torah.

### Part 25
<b>Rather, Abaye said</b> that <b>this</b> is what the plaintiff <b>is saying: I administer an oath to you with an oath, I command you with an oath, I bind you with an oath, I chain you with an oath.</b> The witnesses are liable in all these cases provided that the plaintiff mentions an oath.

### Part 26
§ The mishna teaches: If one administered the oath to the witnesses <b>in</b> the name of <b><i>alef dalet</i>, in</b> the name of <b><i>yod heh</i>, in</b> the name of the <b>Almighty [<i>Shaddai</i>], in</b> the name of the Lord of <b>Hosts [<i>Tzevaot</i>], in</b> the name of the <b>Gracious and Compassionate</b> One, <b>in</b> the name of He Who is <b>Slow to Anger,</b> or <b>in</b> the name of He Who is <b>Abounding in Loving-kindness,</b> these witnesses are liable for taking a false oath of testimony.

### Part 27
Is that <b>to say that gracious and compassionate are</b> sacred <b>names?</b> The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>There are names</b> of God <b>that may be erased and there are names</b> of God <b>that may not be erased</b> due to their inherent sanctity. <b>These are names that may not be erased: For example,</b> several variations of the name God [<i>Elohim</i>]: <b><i>El</i>, <i>Elohekha</i></b> with a second person singular suffix, <b><i>Elohim</i>, <i>Eloheikhem</i></b> with a second person plural suffix; <b>I Shall Be As I Shall Be, <i>alef dalet</i>, <i>yod heh</i>, Almighty [<i>Shaddai</i>],</b> Lord of <b>Hosts [<i>Tzevaot</i>], these</b> names <b>may not be erased.</b>

### Part 28
<b>But</b> adjectives that describe the Holy One, Blessed be He, e.g., <b>the Great, the Mighty, the Awesome, the Prodigious, the Powerful, the Courageous, the Strong, gracious, compassionate, slow to anger, or abounding in loving-kindness; these may be erased.</b> Apparently, gracious and compassionate are adjectives and not actual names of God; how, then, does an oath or a curse in the name of gracious and compassionate take effect?

### Part 29
<b>Abaye said:</b> In <b>the mishna,</b> it is with regard to one who administers an oath or curses <b>in</b> the name of <b>He Who is Gracious,</b>
