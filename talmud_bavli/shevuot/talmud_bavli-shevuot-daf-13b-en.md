### Part 1
It must be that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi concedes that Yom Kippur does not atone for one who violates the day itself and does not repent, as if you do not say so, <b>according to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>there would be no</b> instance in which a person would be liable to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> violating Yom Kippur in <b>the daytime.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara questions this proof: <b>Why not? You</b> could <b>find it</b> in a case <b>where he ate a piece of meat, and</b> while he was eating <b>it choked him and he died, or</b> in a case <b>where he ate immediately before sunset</b> at the end of the day. Even if one holds that Yom Kippur does atone for violations of the day itself, in these cases it could not, <b>as there was no time</b> after the violation for the day <b>to atone for him,</b> in the first case because he was already dead, and in the second case because it was no longer Yom Kippur.

### Part 3
§ The mishna (2b) states: <b>Israelites and priests and</b> the <b>anointed priest,</b> i.e., the High Priest, equally achieve atone-ment. What is the difference between Israelites, priests, and the anointed priest? The difference is only that the priests achieve atonement for their defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods through the bull that the High Priest offers on Yom Kippur, whereas the Israelites achieve atonement for their transgressions through the goats that are sacrificed on Yom Kippur.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>This</b> mishna <b>itself</b> is <b>difficult,</b> as <b>it teaches: Both Israelites and priests and</b> the <b>anointed priest</b> equally achieve atonement. <b>But then it teaches: What is</b> the difference <b>between Israelites, priests, and</b> the <b>anointed priest? Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying: Both Israelites and priests and</b> the <b>anointed priest</b> equally <b>achieve atonement through the scapegoat for transgressions other</b> than the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods, <b>and</b> in this regard <b>there is no distinction between them. But what is</b> the difference <b>between Israelites, priests, and</b> the <b>anointed priest?</b> The difference is <b>only that the bull</b> of the High Priest that he offers on Yom Kippur <b>atones for the priests for</b> their <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods, whereas the Israelites achieve atonement for their transgressions through the goats that are sacrificed on Yom Kippur.

### Part 5
<b>And whose</b> opinion is expressed by the mishna? It <b>is Rabbi Yehuda, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> in exposition of the verse: “He shall bring atonement upon the sanctum of the sacred, and he shall effect atonement upon the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and upon the priests and upon all the people of the congregation shall he bring atonement” (Leviticus 16:33): <b>“He shall bring atonement upon the sanctum of the sacred”; this</b> is referring to <b>the innermost sanctum,</b> i.e., the Holy of Holies. “<b>Upon the Tent of Meeting”; this</b> is referring to the <b>Sanctuary.</b> “And the <b>altar”;</b> this is understood <b>in accordance with its plain meaning. “He shall effect atonement”; this</b> is referring to the Temple <b>courtyards.</b> “And upon the <b>priests”;</b> this is understood <b>in accordance with its plain meaning.</b> “And upon <b>all the people”; these are the Israelites. “Shall he bring atonement”; this</b> is referring to <b>the Levites.</b>

### Part 6
<b>All of them are equated with regard to</b> the fact that they are all atoned for through <b>one atonement,</b> i.e., <b>that they are atoned for by the scapegoat for</b> all <b>transgressions other</b> than the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>

### Part 7
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Just as</b> the <b>blood of the goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary <b>atones for Israelites for</b> their <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods, <b>so too,</b> the <b>blood of the bull</b> of the High Priest, whose blood presentation is also performed inside the Sanctuary, <b>atones for the priests for</b> their <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods. <b>And just as</b> the <b>confession</b> made <b>over the scapegoat atones for Israelites for other transgressions, so too,</b> the <b>confession</b> made <b>over</b> the <b>bull atones for the priests for other transgressions.</b> It is apparent from the <i>baraita</i> that it is only according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda that the scapegoat atones for both Israelites and priests.

### Part 8
The Gemara analyzes Rabbi Shimon’s opinion: <b>And according to Rabbi Shimon,</b> one can ask: <b>Weren’t</b> both Israelites and priests <b>certainly equated</b> in the verse in Leviticus? The Gemara explains: According to his opinion, in <b>what</b> way <b>are they equated</b> in the verse? They are equated in <b>that they are all subject to atonement</b> on Yom Kippur; <b>but each one</b> of the groups <b>achieves atonement in its own</b> way.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason of Rabbi Shimon,</b> who holds that priests are not atoned for by the scapegoat? <b>As it is written: “He shall take the two goats”</b> (Leviticus 16:7); one is used for the scapegoat and the other for the internal goat. With this verse, the <b>scapegoat is juxtaposed with the goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary. It teaches that <b>just as the goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside does not atone for the priests for</b> their <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods, <b>as it is written with regard to</b> that goat: “The goat sin-offering <b>of the people”</b> (Leviticus 16:15), which indicates that it atones for Israelites and not for the priests, <b>so too, the scapegoat does not atone for the priests for</b> their <b>other transgressions.</b>

### Part 10
<b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> how does he understand the juxtaposition? He could have <b>said to you:</b> It is only <b>for this</b> reason that the goats <b>are juxtaposed:</b> The juxtaposition <b>comes</b> to teach <b>that they should be similar in appearance and in height and in value.</b> They are not similar in the atonement that they effect.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught that which the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the internal goat: <b>“He shall slaughter the goat sin-offering of the people”</b> (Leviticus 16:15); the term “of the people” excludes Aaron and the priests, and therefore indicates <b>that the priests do not achieve atonement through</b> that goat. <b>But</b> then, <b>through what do they achieve atonement?</b> Presumably, <b>through</b> the <b>bull of Aaron,</b> i.e., the bull of the High Priest.

### Part 12
One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they would</b> also <b>not achieve atonement through</b> the <b>bull of Aaron, as it is already stated:</b> “Aaron shall bring near <b>his own</b> bull sin-offering” (Leviticus 16:6), which indicates that it atones only for Aaron’s transgressions, not for the transgressions of others. And if <b>that is so,</b> then <b>they do not have</b> any means through which to achieve <b>atonement.</b> But <b>when</b> the verse <b>states: “And he shall effect atonement…upon the priests”</b> (Leviticus 16:33), <b>we have</b> clearly <b>found that they</b> do <b>have</b> a means of achieving <b>atonement.</b>

### Part 13
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Through which</b> means then <b>do they achieve atonement?</b> Do they achieve it through the internal goat or the bull of Aaron? It is <b>better</b> to say <b>that they achieve atonement through the bull of Aaron, as</b> in any event, <b>with regard to his household, an exception was made to its rule</b> that it atones only for Aaron, and his household also achieves atonement from his bull. It is therefore not unreasonable to say that the priesthood should also achieve atonement from his bull. <b>And</b> one should <b>not</b> say that <b>they achieve atonement through the goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary, <b>as it is not</b> found <b>with regard to</b> Aaron’s <b>household</b> that <b>an exception was made to its rule</b> that it atones for the people, as his household does not achieve atonement from the scapegoat.

### Part 14
<b>And if it is your wish to say</b> that this reasoning can be refuted, one can cite another proof, as the verse <b>states:</b> “House of Israel, bless the Lord; <b>house of Aaron, bless the Lord; house of Levi, bless the Lord; those who fear the Lord, bless the Lord”</b> (Psalms 135:19–20). It is apparent from this verse that “house of Aaron” is referring to all priests and not just to Aaron’s immediate household, and so it is reasonable that Aaron’s bull should atone for them.

### Part 15
The Gemara repeats its question about this <i>baraita</i>: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> this <i>baraita</i>? <b>Rabbi Yirmeya says:</b> It <b>is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as, if</b> one suggests that it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> one can counter: <b>Doesn’t he say</b> that the <b>priests have</b> a means of <b>atonement through</b> the <b>scapegoat,</b> whereas the <i>baraita</i> indicates that they do not, as it states that if they do not achieve atonement through the bull of Aaron, then they do not have any means through which to achieve atonement? <b>But</b> then, <b>whose</b> opinion is expressed? <b>Rava says:</b> It <b>is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who says</b> that the <b>priests do not have</b> a means of achieving <b>atonement through</b> the <b>scapegoat.</b>

### Part 16
<b>Abaye said: You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> and <b>this</b> is what it <b>is saying:</b> If <b>that is so,</b> that the priests do not achieve atonement through the bull of Aaron, then <b>they do not have</b> any means through which to achieve <b>atonement for</b> the <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods. <b>When</b> the verse <b>states: “And he shall effect atonement…upon the priests,” we have</b> clearly <b>found that they</b> do <b>have</b> a means of <b>atonement for other transgressions. And</b> it follows that <b>just as we have found that they have</b> a means of <b>atonement for other transgressions,</b> as Israelites do, <b>so</b> too, <b>they</b> must also <b>have</b> a means of <b>atonement</b>
