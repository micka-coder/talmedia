### Part 1
<b>and Rav Yosef says</b> that it is <b>like</b> that of <b>a paid bailee,</b> as while performing the mitzva of taking care of a lost item he is exempt from performing other mitzvot that involve the outlay of money, and the money that he saves is tantamount to payment received. Similarly, since safeguarding collateral is part of the mitzva to lend money to the needy, one who does so is exempt during that time from performing other mitzvot that involve the outlay of money. Therefore, Rabbi Eliezer’s ruling, that even if the collateral was lost the creditor collects the entire debt, is in accordance with the opinion of Rabba, and Rabbi Akiva’s ruling, that the creditor loses the value of the collateral, is in accordance with the opinion of Rav Yosef.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>shall we say</b> that the opinion <b>of Rav Yosef is</b> the subject of a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>?</b> The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No, with regard to one who is safeguarding a lost item, everyone accepts</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Yosef. And here they disagree with regard to</b> a case where <b>the creditor needs the collateral</b> and uses it with the permission of the debtor, deducting a usage fee from the debt. One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Akiva, <b>holds</b> that <b>he is</b> still <b>performing a mitzva</b> by safeguarding it, and is therefore exempt from performing other mitzvot during that time. Consequently, he has the status of a paid bailee. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Eliezer, <b>holds</b> that since he derives benefit from the collateral, he is safeguarding it for his own benefit, and <b>is not performing a mitzva.</b> Therefore, he has the status of an unpaid bailee.

### Part 3
§ The Gemara resumes discussion of Shmuel’s statement that if the creditor loses the collateral, the debt is canceled. <b>Let us say</b> that Shmuel’s ruling is <b>the subject of</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it is stated in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> that the Sabbatical Year does not abrogate debts for which collateral was taken: If <b>one lends</b> money <b>to another on</b> the basis of <b>collateral and the Sabbatical Year commences,</b> then <b>even if</b> the collateral <b>is worth only half</b> the value of the loan, the Sabbatical Year <b>does not abrogate</b> the debt; this is <b>the statement of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi says: If</b> the value of the <b>collateral was commensurate with his debt,</b> the Sabbatical Year <b>does not abrogate</b> the debt, <b>but if</b> it was <b>not</b> commensurate with the debt, the Sabbatical Year <b>abrogates</b> the debt.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the statement: The Sabbatical Year <b>does not abrogate</b> the debt, <b>which the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, <b>says? If we say</b> it means that the Sabbatical Year does not abrogate that part of the debt that is <b>commensurate with</b> the collateral, but it does abrogate the rest, this indicates <b>by inference that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi holds</b> that the Sabbatical Year <b>abrogates</b> the entire debt, including the part <b>commensurate with</b> the collateral <b>as well. But</b> if this is so, <b>why did</b> the creditor <b>seize collateral</b> from the debtor at all?

### Part 5
<b>Rather, is it not</b> that Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says that the Sabbatical Year does not abrogate the debt at all, and the debtor is liable to pay an amount <b>commensurate with</b> the <b>entire</b> debt? <b>And</b> accordingly, <b>they disagree with regard to Shmuel’s</b> principle that collateral is considered equivalent to the entire debt, even if it is worth less than the debt.

### Part 6
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No, actually,</b> the statement of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel that the Sabbatical Year does not abrogate the debt is referring only to the part of the debt <b>commensurate with</b> the collateral, <b>and they disagree with regard to that</b> part of the debt. <b>The first <i>tanna</i>,</b> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, <b>holds</b> that the Sabbatical Year does not abrogate the part of the debt <b>commensurate with</b> the collateral, <b>and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi holds</b> that it <b>abrogates</b> the part of the debt <b>commensurate with</b> the collateral <b>as well. And as for</b> the question <b>you said: For what</b> purpose <b>did he seize collateral from him</b> at all, the answer is that he takes it <b>merely as a reminder,</b> to increase the likelihood that the debt will be paid.
