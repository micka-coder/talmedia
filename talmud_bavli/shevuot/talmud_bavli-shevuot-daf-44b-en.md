### Part 1
<b>and Rav Yosef says</b> that it is <b>like</b> that of <b>a paid bailee,</b> as while performing the mitzva of taking care of a lost item he is exempt from performing other mitzvot that involve the outlay of money, and the money that he saves is tantamount to payment received. Similarly, since safeguarding collateral is part of the mitzva to lend money to the needy, one who does so is exempt during that time from performing other mitzvot that involve the outlay of money. Therefore, Rabbi Eliezer’s ruling, that even if the collateral was lost the creditor collects the entire debt, is in accordance with the opinion of Rabba, and Rabbi Akiva’s ruling, that the creditor loses the value of the collateral, is in accordance with the opinion of Rav Yosef.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>shall we say</b> that the opinion <b>of Rav Yosef is</b> the subject of a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>?</b> The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No, with regard to one who is safeguarding a lost item, everyone accepts</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Yosef. And here they disagree with regard to</b> a case where <b>the creditor needs the collateral</b> and uses it with the permission of the debtor, deducting a usage fee from the debt. One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Akiva, <b>holds</b> that <b>he is</b> still <b>performing a mitzva</b> by safeguarding it, and is therefore exempt from performing other mitzvot during that time. Consequently, he has the status of a paid bailee. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Eliezer, <b>holds</b> that since he derives benefit from the collateral, he is safeguarding it for his own benefit, and <b>is not performing a mitzva.</b> Therefore, he has the status of an unpaid bailee.

### Part 3
§ The Gemara resumes discussion of Shmuel’s statement that if the creditor loses the collateral, the debt is canceled. <b>Let us say</b> that Shmuel’s ruling is <b>the subject of</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it is stated in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> that the Sabbatical Year does not abrogate debts for which collateral was taken: If <b>one lends</b> money <b>to another on</b> the basis of <b>collateral and the Sabbatical Year commences,</b> then <b>even if</b> the collateral <b>is worth only half</b> the value of the loan, the Sabbatical Year <b>does not abrogate</b> the debt; this is <b>the statement of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi says: If</b> the value of the <b>collateral was commensurate with his debt,</b> the Sabbatical Year <b>does not abrogate</b> the debt, <b>but if</b> it was <b>not</b> commensurate with the debt, the Sabbatical Year <b>abrogates</b> the debt.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the statement: The Sabbatical Year <b>does not abrogate</b> the debt, <b>which the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, <b>says? If we say</b> it means that the Sabbatical Year does not abrogate that part of the debt that is <b>commensurate with</b> the collateral, but it does abrogate the rest, this indicates <b>by inference that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi holds</b> that the Sabbatical Year <b>abrogates</b> the entire debt, including the part <b>commensurate with</b> the collateral <b>as well. But</b> if this is so, <b>why did</b> the creditor <b>seize collateral</b> from the debtor at all?

### Part 5
<b>Rather, is it not</b> that Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says that the Sabbatical Year does not abrogate the debt at all, and the debtor is liable to pay an amount <b>commensurate with</b> the <b>entire</b> debt? <b>And</b> accordingly, <b>they disagree with regard to Shmuel’s</b> principle that collateral is considered equivalent to the entire debt, even if it is worth less than the debt.

### Part 6
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No, actually,</b> the statement of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel that the Sabbatical Year does not abrogate the debt is referring only to the part of the debt <b>commensurate with</b> the collateral, <b>and they disagree with regard to that</b> part of the debt. <b>The first <i>tanna</i>,</b> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, <b>holds</b> that the Sabbatical Year does not abrogate the part of the debt <b>commensurate with</b> the collateral, <b>and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi holds</b> that it <b>abrogates</b> the part of the debt <b>commensurate with</b> the collateral <b>as well. And as for</b> the question <b>you said: For what</b> purpose <b>did he seize collateral from him</b> at all, the answer is that he takes it <b>merely as a reminder,</b> to increase the likelihood that the debt will be paid.

### Part 8
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>All</b> those <b>who take an oath that</b> is legislated <b>by the Torah take an oath and do not pay.</b> By Torah law, one takes an oath only in order to exempt himself from a monetary claim. <b>And these</b> litigants <b>take</b> a rabbinically instituted <b>oath and receive</b> possession of the disputed funds or property, i.e., their claim is upheld by means of the oath, even though they are not in possession of the property in question: <b>A hired worker</b> who claims that he has not received his wages; <b>and one who was robbed</b> and sues the person who robbed him; <b>and one who was injured,</b> who claims compensation from the person who injured him; <b>and one whose opposing</b> litigant is <b>suspect with regard to the</b> taking of an <b>oath.</b> When a person suspected of taking false oaths is liable to take an oath in order to exempt himself, the claimant takes an oath instead and receives payment. <b>And a storekeeper</b> relying <b>on his ledger</b> also takes an oath and is paid.

### Part 9
<b>How</b> does this <i>halakha</i> apply to <b>the hired worker?</b> The case is where one <b>says to</b> his employer: <b>Give me my wages that are</b> still <b>in your possession.</b> The employer <b>says: I</b> already <b>gave</b> them to you. <b>And that</b> worker <b>says: I have not received</b> them. In such a case, the worker <b>takes an oath</b> that he has not received his wages, <b>and he receives</b> payment from his employer. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> This oath cannot be administered <b>unless there is partial admission</b> on the part of the employer. <b>How so?</b> The case is where the worker <b>said to him: Give me my wages, fifty</b> silver <b>dinars, which are</b> still <b>in your possession. And</b> the employer <b>says: You have</b> already <b>received one golden dinar,</b> which is worth twenty-five silver dinars. Since the employer has admitted that he owes part of the sum, the worker takes an oath and is paid the whole sum.

### Part 10
<b>How</b> does this <i>halakha</i> apply to <b>one who was robbed?</b> The case is where witnesses <b>testified about</b> the defendant <b>that he entered</b> the claimant’s <b>house to seize collateral from him without</b> the <b>authority</b> to do so. The claimant <b>said: You took items</b> that <b>belong to me. And</b> the defendant <b>said: I did not take</b> them. The claimant <b>takes an oath and receives</b> payment of his claim. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> This oath cannot be administered <b>unless there is partial admission</b> on the part of the defendant. <b>How so?</b> The case is where the claimant <b>said to him: You took two items. And he says: I took only one.</b> Since the defendant admits that he took one item from the house, the claimant takes an oath and receives payment of his whole claim.

### Part 11
<b>How</b> does this <i>halakha</i> apply to <b>one who was injured?</b> The case is where witnesses <b>testified about</b> the injured person <b>that he entered into the domain of</b> the defendant <b>whole but left injured, and</b> the claimant <b>said to</b> the defendant: <b>You injured me. And</b> the defendant <b>says: I did not injure</b> you. The injured party <b>takes an oath and receives</b> compensation. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> This oath cannot be administered <b>unless there is partial admission. How so?</b> The case is where the claimant <b>said to</b> the defendant: <b>You injured me twice. And the other says: I injured you only once.</b> In such a case, the injured party takes an oath that he was injured twice and receives compensation for both injuries.

### Part 12
<b>How</b> does this <i>halakha</i> apply to <b>one whose opposing</b> litigant is <b>suspect with regard to the</b> taking of an <b>oath</b> and therefore is not permitted to take the oath?
