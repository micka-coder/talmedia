### Part 1
<b>And if it is so</b> that Rabbi Akiva lists the different shades in decreasing order of their degree of brightness, then after mentioning the reddish variation of <i>baheret</i> <b>he should have</b> next said: The reddish variation <b>of a wool-</b>white mark <b>is darker than it,</b> not that the reddish variation of lime is darker than it.

### Part 2
<b>They said</b> in response to this: <b>Yes, it is indeed so</b> that Rabbi Akiva continues by referring to the reddish variations of a wool-white mark, <b>and it is taught</b> likewise in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Natan says,</b> referring to that mishna: It is <b>not</b> correct <b>that Rabbi Akiva said:</b> The reddish variation <b>of lime is darker than it; rather,</b> he said that the reddish variation <b>of a</b> wool-white mark <b>is darker than it.</b>

### Part 3
§ The Gemara considers the source from which the different shades of marks are derived: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that <i>baheret</i> is an intense</b> white color? <b>Abaye said: The verse states:</b> “And <b>if it is a white <i>baheret</i>”</b> (Leviticus 13:4), which indicates that <b>it</b> alone <b>is</b> a bright <b>white and there is no other</b> as <b>white</b> as it.

### Part 4
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The bright shade of <b>a <i>baheret</i></b> makes it appear <b>deeper</b> than the surrounding skin, <b>and so</b> the verse <b>states: “And its appearance is deeper than the skin”</b> (Leviticus 13:25). This is <b>like the appearance of</b> an area illuminated by the <b>sun, which</b> appears <b>deeper than</b> the area in <b>the shade.</b> The darker shade of <b>a <i>se’et</i></b> makes it appear as though it is raised above the surrounding skin; this is indicated by the fact that the word <b><i>se’et</i></b> means <b>nothing other than raised, and so</b> the verse <b>states: “Upon all the high mountains and upon all the raised up [<i>hanissaot</i>] hills”</b> (Isaiah 2:14). The words <i>hanissaot</i> and <i>se’et</i> share the same Hebrew root and both refer to something raised up. In the verse: “For a <i>se’et</i> and for a <i>sappaḥat</i>” (Leviticus 14:56), the word <b><i>sappaḥat</i></b> means <b>nothing other than secondary, and so</b> the verse <b>states: “And he will say: Append me [<i>sefaḥeni</i>] please</b> to one of the priestly classes to eat a piece of bread” (I Samuel 2:36). This teaches that there is a leprous mark that is secondary and appended to a <i>se’et</i>. This is a mark that is the color of an egg membrane.

### Part 5
<b>We found</b> a source for a mark that is <b>secondary to a <i>se’et</i>; from where do we</b> derive that there is also a mark that is <b>secondary to a <i>baheret</i>? Rabbi Zeira said: “White”</b> (Leviticus 13:10) <b>is stated with regard to a <i>se’et</i> and “white”</b> (Leviticus 13:4) <b>is stated with regard to a <i>baheret</i>.</b> This teaches that <b>just as</b> the shade of <b>white stated with regard to a <i>se’et</i> has a secondary</b> mark, i.e., the mark that is the color of an egg membrane, <b>so too,</b> the shade of <b>white stated with regard to a <i>baheret</i> has a secondary</b> mark, i.e., the lime-colored mark.

### Part 6
A different source for this <b>was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse</b> (see Leviticus 13:2) <b>placed</b> the word <b><i>sappaḥat</i> between <i>se’et</i> and <i>baheret</i>, to say to you: Just as</b> there is a shade that is <b>secondary to a <i>se’et</i>, so too,</b> there is a shade that is <b>secondary to a <i>baheret</i>.</b>

### Part 7
The mishna in <i>Nega’im</i> cited above states: <b>A <i>se’et</i></b> is <b>like white wool.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is meant by <b>white wool? Rav Beivai says</b> that <b>Rav Asi says:</b> It is the color of <b>clean wool</b> from a lamb <b>that</b> is <b>wrapped up [<i>mekhabnin</i>]</b> in a cover when it is <b>one day old</b> in order to protect it from being sullied, so that the wool will be suitable <b>for</b> producing <b>a fine wool</b> garment.

### Part 8
§ In continuation of his statement cited above <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> The following is <b>an analogy</b> to illustrate the opinion <b>of the Rabbis,</b> i.e., the opinion expressed in the mishna in <i>Nega’im</i> (1:1) that both a <i>baheret</i> and a <i>se’et</i> have marks that are secondary to them. <b>To what is this matter comparable? To two kings and to two governors [<i>iparkhei</i>]</b> where, with regard to their supremacy, <b>the king of this</b> governor <b>is above the king of that</b> governor, <b>and the governor of this</b> king <b>is above the governor of that</b> king. The two kings are analogous to a <i>baheret</i> and a <i>se’et</i> and their two governors are, respectively, a lime-colored mark and an egg membrane–colored mark. Accordingly, the order of supremacy is: <i>Baheret</i>, <i>se’et</i>, lime-colored mark, egg membrane–colored mark.

### Part 9
The Gemara questions whether this is a suitable analogy for the opinion of the Rabbis: But <b>this</b> analogy suggests that the shades are ordered, <b>this</b> one <b>above this</b> one <b>and that</b> one <b>above that</b> one, i.e., according to their degrees of brightness. That is Rabbi Akiva’s opinion, not the opinion of the Rabbis.

### Part 10
<b>Rather,</b> a suitable analogy is where <b>the king of this</b> governor is <b>above his own governor, and the king of that</b> governor is <b>above his own governor.</b> So too, each secondary mark is subordinate only to its primary mark.

### Part 11
The Gemara presents a different analogy. <b>Rav Adda bar Abba said: For example: A king, and a chief officer [<i>alkafta</i>], the vizier [<i>rofila</i>], and the Exilarch;</b> each person in the list is more powerful than the subsequent one. The Gemara asks: But <b>this</b> analogy suggests that the shades are ordered, <b>this</b> one <b>above that</b> one, which is Rabbi Akiva’s opinion. <b>Rather,</b> a suitable analogy is, <b>for example: A king and the vizier; and a chief officer and the Exilarch.</b> This list splits the four into two groups, each group containing one person who is subordinate to the other.

### Part 12
The Gemara presents a different analogy. <b>Rava said:</b> The previous suggestion is not precise because all these positions, apart from the king, are subordinate to the king. A more precise analogy would be, <b>for example: King Shapur,</b> the king of Persia, with his subordinate; <b>and</b> the Roman <b>emperor</b> with his subordinate.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Pappa said to Rava: Which of them is greater,</b> King Shapur or the Roman emperor? Rava <b>said to him: Does he eat in the forest,</b> i.e., do you live disconnected and unaware of events in the world at large? <b>Go out</b> and <b>see whose coin circulates throughout the world,</b> which is an indicator of a government’s influence, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to the fourth empire described in Daniel’s dream of the future powers of the world: <b>“It shall devour the whole earth and tread upon it and break it into pieces”</b> (Daniel 7:23), and <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This is the guilty</b> empire of <b>Rome whose coin circulates throughout the entire world.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara presents a different analogy. <b>Ravina said: For example,</b> a new white <b>woolen garment and a frayed</b> one; a new <b>linen sheet and a frayed one.</b>

### Part 15
§ The mishna (2a) states: In cases of defiling the Temple or its sacrificial foods <b>in which</b> one <b>had awareness at the beginning</b> and awareness at the end, but had a lapse of awareness in between while he actually transgressed, this person is liable to bring a sliding-scale offering. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that the verse</b> that describes the liability for a sliding-scale offering (see Leviticus 5:2–4) <b>speaks of nothing other than</b> the <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods? While the verse mentions that a violation was committed due to a lapse of awareness of one’s state of impurity, it does not mention which transgression was violated.

### Part 16
The Gemara explains: <b>And it is a logical inference: Since</b> the Torah has explicitly <b>prohibited and</b> also <b>prescribed punishment for the</b> intentional <b>defiling</b> of something sacred <b>and has rendered one liable</b> to bring <b>an offering for the</b> unwitting <b>defiling</b> of something sacred, it follows that <b>just as when it prohibited and</b> also <b>prescribed punishment for the defiling</b> of something sacred <b>it prohibited and</b> also <b>prescribed punishment only for the</b> intentional <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods; <b>so too, when it rendered one liable</b> to bring <b>an offering for the defiling</b> of something sacred <b>it rendered one liable</b> to do so <b>only for the</b> unwitting <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods.

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>But say</b> instead that the obligation to bring a sliding-scale offering is referring to a ritually impure person who partook of <b>the sacred portion of produce grown in Eretz Yisrael that is designated to be given to a priest [<i>teruma</i>], as</b> the Torah also <b>has</b> explicitly <b>prohibited and prescribed punishment</b> for this. One who partakes of <i>teruma</i> while ritually impure is liable to receive death at the hand of Heaven (see Leviticus 22:9). The Gemara answers: It cannot be referring to <i>teruma</i>, because <b>we do not find a sin</b> whose punishment for an intentional violation is <b>death,</b> with regard to <b>which</b> one <b>is liable</b> to bring <b>an offering</b> for its unwitting violation. Sin-offerings, of which the sliding-scale offering is one type, are brought only for transgressions whose intentional violation is punishable by <i>karet</i>.

### Part 18
The Gemara asks: But <b>say</b> that <b>this statement</b> applies only to <b>a fixed</b> sin-<b>offering, but</b>
