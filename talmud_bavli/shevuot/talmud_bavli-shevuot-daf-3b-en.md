### Part 1
<b>But</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> these cases <b>similar to</b> the different <b>shades of</b> leprous <b>marks,</b> which indicates that <b>just as there, all</b> four <b>of them</b> are shades <b>for</b> which there is <b>liability</b> to bring an offering, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to oaths and the cases of one’s awareness of the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods, <b>all</b> four <b>of them</b> are cases <b>for</b> which there is <b>liability</b> to bring an offering.

### Part 2
The Gemara suggests a different resolution: <b>Actually,</b> the mishna expresses the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael. And while Rabbi Yishmael does not deem one liable for</b> oaths <b>pertaining to the past,</b> that is only with regard to liability to bring <b>an offering; but he does deem one liable</b> to be administered <b>lashes.</b>

### Part 3
<b>And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rava, as Rava says: The Torah explicitly amplifies</b> the prohibition of taking <b>a false oath</b> to be <b>similar to</b> the prohibition of <b>an oath taken in vain,</b> to teach that one is flogged for its violation. It follows that <b>just as</b> an oath taken in <b>vain pertains to the past</b> and renders one liable to receive lashes, <b>so too,</b> taking <b>a false</b> oath that <b>pertains to the past</b> renders one liable to receive lashes.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted</b> that one who stated: On my oath <b>I ate,</b> but in fact he did not eat, <b>or</b> one who stated: On my oath <b>I did not eat,</b> but in fact he ate, is liable to receive lashes, as this is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rava.</b> And <b>also</b> if one stated: On my oath <b>I will not eat, and he ate</b> in violation of his oath, he is liable to receive lashes, as it <b>is a prohibition that involves an action,</b> and, in general, such prohibitions are punishable by flogging. <b>But</b> if one stated: On my oath <b>I will eat, and</b> in violation of his oath <b>he did not eat, why</b> should he be liable to receive lashes? It <b>is a prohibition that does not involve an action.</b> The generally accepted principle is that one is not liable to receive lashes for violating a prohibition without performing an action.

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> disagrees with the generally accepted principle and <b>holds</b> that <b>one is flogged for</b> the violation of <b>a prohibition that does not involve an action.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara challenges: <b>If so,</b> then <b>a difficulty</b> arises between one statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan and</b> another statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b>

### Part 7
<b>As Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is always <b>in accordance with</b> the ruling of <b>an unattributed mishna.</b> Since the mishna here is unattributed and assumes that one is flogged for taking a false oath, Rabbi Yoḥanan should rule that this is the <i>halakha</i>.

### Part 8
<b>And</b> an amoraic dispute <b>was stated</b> with regard to one who said: On my <b>oath I will eat this loaf today, and the day passed and he did not eat it. Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish both say: He is not flogged</b> for taking a false oath. They disagree with regard to the reason that he is not flogged. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: He is not flogged due to</b> the fact <b>that it is a prohibition that does not involve an action,</b> as he violates the oath by failing to perform an action rather than by performing an action, <b>and</b> the principle is: With regard to <b>any prohibition that does not involve an action, one is not flogged for its</b> violation. <b>And Reish Lakish says: He is not flogged</b> because <b>it is an uncertain forewarning,</b> as one cannot forewarn him before he fails to fulfill the oath because as long as time remains in the day he can still later eat the loaf and fulfill the oath; <b>and an uncertain forewarning is not characterized as forewarning.</b> Evidently, Rabbi Yoḥanan does not rule in accordance with the mishna here.

### Part 9
The Gemara resolves the difficulty: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan found another unattributed</b> mishna which holds that one is not flogged for a prohibition that does not involve an action, and he rules in accordance with that mishna.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>Which</b> other <b>unattributed</b> mishna did he find? <b>If we say</b> he found <b>this unattributed</b> mishna, <b>as we learned</b> (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 84a): <b>But one who leaves over</b> some of the meat <b>of a ritually pure</b> Paschal offering until the morning of the fifteenth of Nisan <b>and one who breaks</b> a bone <b>of a ritually impure</b> Paschal offering <b>are not flogged</b> with <b>the forty</b> lashes, that is difficult.

### Part 11
First, the Gemara explains how this mishna demonstrates Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion: <b>Granted</b> that <b>breaking</b> a bone <b>of a impure</b> Paschal offering does not incur lashes, <b>as it is written: “Nor shall you break a bone in it”</b> (Exodus 12:46). The term “in it” indicates that the verse refers only <b>to a valid</b> Paschal offering, <b>but not to a disqualified</b> one, such as one that is impure. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>one who leaves over</b> some of the meat <b>of a pure</b> Paschal offering, <b>what is the reason</b> he is not flogged? <b>Is it not because it is</b> a violation of <b>a prohibition that does not involve an action, and for</b> a violation of <b>any prohibition that does not involve an action one is not flogged?</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara now questions this explanation of the mishna: <b>But from where</b> is it apparent that this mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ya’akov, who says</b> that for a violation of <b>a prohibition that does not involve an action, one is not flogged? Perhaps</b> the mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, and</b> he holds that the reason the mishna rules that one is not flogged is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that the verse comes to position</b> the <b>positive mitzva</b> of burning the leftover meat <b>after</b> the <b>prohibition</b> of leaving over the meat, and one is not flogged for a prohibition whose violation obligates one in a positive mitzva. <b>But were it not for this, one would be flogged,</b> despite the fact it is a prohibition that does not involve an action. Since the unattributed mishna is not necessarily in accordance with Rabbi Yaakov’s opinion, it cannot be the basis of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s ruling.

### Part 13
The Gemara cites the source of Rabbi Yaakov’s and Rabbi Yehuda’s opinions: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: “And <b>you shall let nothing of it remain until the morning, and that which remains of it until the morning you shall burn in fire”</b> (Exodus 12:10). <b>The verse comes to position</b> the <b>positive mitzva</b> of burning the leftover meat <b>after</b> the <b>prohibition</b> against leaving over the meat, <b>to say that one is not flogged for its</b> violation; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Ya’akov says: This is not for</b> that <b>reason; rather,</b> it is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that it is a prohibition that does not involve an action, and for</b> a violation of <b>a prohibition that does not involve an action one is not flogged.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>found this unattributed</b> mishna, which teaches (27b): If one states: On my <b>oath I will not eat this loaf,</b> and immediately states: On my <b>oath I will not eat it, and</b> then <b>he ate it,</b>
