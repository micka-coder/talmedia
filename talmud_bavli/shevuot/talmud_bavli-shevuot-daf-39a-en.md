### Part 1
<b>that the entire world trembled when the Holy One, Blessed be He, said at</b> Mount <b>Sinai: “You shall not take the name of the Lord, your God, in vain,</b> for the Lord will not hold guiltless one who takes His name in vain” (Exodus 20:7).

### Part 2
<b>And</b> be aware that <b>with regard to all of the</b> other <b>transgressions in the Torah it is stated: “And will…clear the guilty [<i>venakkeh</i>]”</b> (Exodus 34:7); <b>whereas here,</b> with regard to taking a false oath, <b>it is stated: “Will not hold guiltless [<i>lo yenakkeh</i>].” And</b> be aware that with regard to <b>all of the</b> other <b>transgressions in the Torah, punishment is exacted</b> only <b>from</b> the transgressor, whereas <b>here,</b> punishment is exacted <b>from him and from his family, as it is stated: “Do not allow your mouth to bring your flesh into guilt”</b> (Ecclesiastes 5:5). The verse indicates that one who sins with his mouth, by taking a false oath, causes his flesh to be punished as well; <b>and one’s flesh is nothing other than his relative, as it is stated: “And that you not hide yourself from your own flesh”</b> (Isaiah 58:7).

### Part 3
<b>And</b> be aware that with regard to <b>all of the</b> other <b>transgressions in the Torah, punishment is exacted</b> only <b>from</b> the transgressor; whereas <b>here,</b> punishment is exacted <b>from him and from the entire world, as it is stated: “Swearing, and lying,</b> and murdering, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break all bounds…Therefore, the land mourns, and everyone who dwells therein languishes” (Hosea 4:2–3).

### Part 4
The Gemara suggests: <b>And</b> why not <b>say</b> that punishment is not exacted from the entire world <b>unless he commits all of</b> the sins mentioned in the verse? The Gemara answers: This should <b>not enter your mind, as it is written: “Because of swearing the land mourns”</b> (Jeremiah 23:10), indicating that taking a false oath is sufficient to cause the land to mourn. <b>And it is</b> similarly <b>written</b> in the verse in Hosea: <b>“Therefore, the land mourns, and everyone who dwells therein languishes.”</b> Both verses employ a term of mourning.

### Part 5
The <i>baraita</i> continues with the judges’ forewarning: <b>And</b> be aware that with regard to <b>all the</b> other <b>transgressions in the Torah, if</b> the transgressor <b>has merit,</b> God <b>suspends his</b> punishment for <b>two or three generations,</b> and only if his descendants follow in his ways are they punished. Whereas <b>here, punishment is exacted from him immediately, as it is stated:</b> “This is the curse that goes forth over the face of the whole land…<b>I cause it to go forth, says the Lord of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of he who swears falsely by My name; and it shall abide in the midst of his house and shall consume it, with its timber and its stones”</b> (Zechariah 5:3–4).

### Part 6
The <i>baraita</i> analyzes the verse: <b>“I cause it to go forth”</b> means <b>immediately. “And it shall enter into the house of the thief”; this</b> is referring to <b>one who deceives people,</b> e.g., one <b>who has no money in the possession of another, but claims</b> money from <b>him and administers an oath to him</b> in court, thereby causing an oath to be taken in vain. <b>“And into the house of he who swears falsely by My name”</b> is <b>as it indicates,</b> in accordance with its straightforward meaning. From the end of the verse: <b>“And it shall abide in the midst of his house and shall consume it, with its timber and its stones,” you have therefore learned</b> that <b>a false oath consumes things that</b> even <b>fire and water do not consume,</b> such as stones.

### Part 7
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>If</b> the defendant <b>says</b> at this point: <b>I will not take an oath,</b> the court <b>dismisses him immediately,</b> and rules him liable to pay. <b>And if he says: I will take an oath, the</b> people <b>standing there say to each other: “Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men,</b> and touch nothing of theirs, lest you be swept away in all their sins” (Numbers 16:26). <b>And when</b> the judges <b>administer the oath to him, they say to him: Be aware that we administer an oath to you not according to your understanding</b> of the oath, <b>but according to the</b> objective <b>understanding of the Omnipresent and according to the understanding of the court,</b> i.e., the judges’ intention.

### Part 8
This is <b>as we</b> have <b>found</b> written <b>with regard to Moses, our teacher. When he administered an oath to the Jewish people</b> in the plains of Moab so that they would accept the Torah upon themselves, <b>he said to them: Know that</b> it is <b>not according to your understanding that I administer an oath to you, but according to the understanding of the Omnipresent and according to my understanding. As it is stated: “Neither with you only</b> do I make this covenant and this oath” (Deuteronomy 29:13), which is homiletically interpreted to mean: Not only according to your intention.

### Part 9
Having quoted a verse, the <i>baraita</i> tangentially interprets the subsequent verse. From the phrase: <b>“But with he who stands here</b> with us this day” (Deuteronomy 29:14), <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>those who stood at Mount Sinai</b> were included in this covenant. <b>From where</b> do I derive that <b>the subsequent generations, and the converts who will convert in the future,</b> were also included? <b>The verse states: “And also with he who is not here</b> with us this day” (Deuteronomy 29:14).

### Part 10
<b>And I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the <b>mitzvot that</b> the Jewish people <b>accepted upon themselves at Mount Sinai</b> were included in the oath. <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>mitzvot that were to be initiated in the future, for example, the reading of the Megilla,</b> the Scroll of Esther, on Purim, were also included? <b>The verse states:</b> “The Jews <b>ordained and took</b> upon themselves…that they would keep these two days” (Esther 9:27), which is homiletically interpreted to mean: <b>They ordained,</b> in the generation of Esther, mitzvot <b>that they had already accepted</b> upon themselves by oath in the plains of Moab.

### Part 11
§ The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>. <b>What</b> is the precise meaning of the statement: An oath imposed by the judges <b>may also</b> be <b>recited in its language?</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara answers: It is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Sota</i> 32a): <b>These are recited in any language</b> and it is not required that they be recited in Hebrew: <b>The portion of</b> the warning and the oath administered by the priest to <b>a woman suspected by her husband of having been unfaithful [<i>sota</i>]; the declaration of tithes,</b> which occurs after the third and the sixth year of the seven-year Sabbatical cycle, when one declares that he has given his tithes appropriately; <b>the recitation of <i>Shema</i>; and</b> the <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer; and Grace after Meals; and the oath of testimony,</b> where one takes an oath that he does not have any testimony to provide on a given issue; <b>and the oath on a deposit,</b> where one takes an oath that he does not have possession of another’s deposit. All these may be recited in any language. <b>And</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>also states,</b> as an addendum to this <i>halakha</i>, that <b>an oath</b> imposed <b>by the judges may also</b> be <b>recited in its language,</b> i.e., in any language.

### Part 13
§ <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i> above that the judges <b>say to him: Be aware that the entire world trembled when the Holy One, Blessed be He, said: “You shall not take the name of the Lord, your God, in vain.” What is the reason</b> that the entire world trembled? <b>If we say</b> it was <b>because</b> this prohibition <b>was given at</b> Mount <b>Sinai,</b> this is difficult, as when the entire world trembled, the rest of the <b>Ten Commandments were also given</b> at Mount Sinai. This quality is not unique to this specific prohibition.

### Part 14
<b>And</b> if it is <b>rather due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> this prohibition is <b>severe, is it</b> more <b>severe</b> than all the other prohibitions? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>These are minor</b> transgressions: Violation of an ordinary <b>positive</b> mitzva <b>and</b> an ordinary <b>negative</b> mitzva, <b>except for: “You shall not take</b> the name of the Lord, your God, in vain.” And these are <b>major</b> transgressions: Those for which one is liable to receive <b>excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>] or a court</b>-imposed <b>death</b> penalty; <b>and “You shall not take</b> the name of the Lord, your God, in vain” is also <b>among them.</b> Evidently, this transgression is no more severe than transgressions that incur <i>karet</i> or the death penalty.

### Part 15
<b>Rather, the reason</b> the world trembled particularly when this prohibition was given is <b>as it is taught</b> subsequently in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And with regard to all of the</b> other <b>transgressions in the Torah it is stated: “And will…clear the guilty,” whereas here, it is stated: “Will not hold guiltless.”</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>And is it not stated with regard to all of the</b> other <b>transgressions in the Torah</b> that God <b>“will not hold guiltless [<i>lo yenakkeh</i>]”</b> one who transgresses? <b>But isn’t it written: “And Who will by no means clear the guilty [<i>venakkeh lo yenakkeh</i>]”</b> (Exodus 34:7)?

### Part 17
The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse is <b>necessary for</b> that which is derived through the homiletic interpretation <b>of Rabbi Elazar, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Elazar says: It is not possible to say: And will clear the guilty [<i>venakkeh</i>],</b> about all transgressions, <b>since: Will not clear the guilty [<i>lo yenakkeh</i>], is already stated.</b> And <b>it is not possible to say: Will not clear the guilty [<i>lo yenakkeh</i>], since: And will clear the guilty [<i>venakkeh</i>], is already stated. How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? The Holy One, Blessed be <b>He, clears those</b> guilty ones <b>who repent and does not clear those who do not repent.</b>

### Part 18
§ It is stated in the <i>baraita</i> that with regard to <b>all of the transgressions in the Torah, punishment is exacted</b> only <b>from</b> the transgressor, whereas <b>here,</b> punishment is exacted <b>from him and from his family.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is punishment <b>not</b> exacted <b>from</b> the transgressor’s <b>family</b> with regard to <b>all of the</b> other <b>transgressions in the Torah?</b>

### Part 19
<b>But isn’t it written</b> in the Torah with regard to one who worships Molech: <b>“Then I will set My face against that man, and against his family,</b> and I will cut him off” (Leviticus 20:5)? <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon said: If he sinned, how did his family sin?</b> Why are they punished? This serves <b>to tell you</b> that <b>there is no family that has</b> an unauthorized <b>tax collector among them</b> in <b>which all of</b> the family members <b>are not</b> regarded as unauthorized <b>tax collectors, and</b> similarly, there is no family <b>that has a bandit [<i>listim</i>] among them</b> in <b>which all of</b> the family members <b>are not</b> regarded as <b>bandits.</b> This is <b>because they cover for him.</b> Evidently, punishment is exacted from the transgressor’s family with regard to transgressions other than taking a false oath.

### Part 20
The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> with regard to other transgressions, the transgressor’s family is punished <b>with another punishment,</b> less severe than the one the transgressor receives, whereas <b>here,</b> with regard to a false oath, the transgressor’s family is punished <b>with his punishment. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> with regard to one who worships Molech: <b>“And I will cut him off”? Since it is stated</b> earlier in the verse: <b>“Then I will set My face</b> against that man, and against his family,” one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>the entire family</b> is liable <b>to</b> be punished with <b><i>karet</i>.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And I will cut <b>him</b> off,” indicating that only <b>he</b> is liable <b>to</b> be punished with <b><i>karet</i>,</b> whereas <b>his entire family is not</b> liable <b>to</b> be punished with <b><i>karet</i>.</b>

### Part 21
§ The <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all of the</b> other <b>transgressions in the Torah, punishment is exacted</b> only <b>from him,</b> whereas <b>here,</b> punishment is exacted <b>from him and from the entire world, as it is stated: “Swearing and lying,</b> and murdering, and stealing, and committing adultery,” <b>and it is written: “Therefore, the land mourns.”</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>And</b> why not <b>say</b> that punishment is not exacted from the entire world <b>unless he commits all</b> the sins mentioned in the verse? The Gemara answers: This should <b>not enter your mind, as it is written: “Because of swearing the land mourns”</b> (Jeremiah 23:10), indicating that a false oath is sufficient to cause the land to mourn.

### Part 22
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all of the</b> other <b>transgressions in the Torah,</b> is punishment <b>not</b> exacted <b>from the entire world? But isn’t it written: “And they shall stumble one upon another”</b> (Leviticus 26:37)? This verse is homiletically interpreted to mean that they shall stumble spiritually, <b>one due to the iniquity of another,</b> which <b>teaches that the entire Jewish people are</b> considered <b>guarantors for one another.</b> Apparently, any transgression makes the entire world liable to be punished.
