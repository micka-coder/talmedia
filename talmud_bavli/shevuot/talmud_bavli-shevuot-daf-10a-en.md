### Part 1
<b>And</b> through this additional “and,” the <b>goats of</b> the <b>Festivals are juxtaposed with</b> the <b>goats of</b> the <b>New Moons,</b> indicating that <b>just as</b> the <b>goats of</b> the <b>New Moons atone for a case involving sacrificial</b> food, i.e., where a ritually pure person partook of ritually impure sacrificial food, <b>so too,</b> the <b>goats of the Festivals atone for</b> a similar <b>case involving sacrificial</b> food, i.e., where a ritually impure person partook of ritually pure sacrificial food.

### Part 2
<b>And if you would say: Let</b> the goats of the Festivals <b>atone for</b> that which the goats <b>of</b> the <b>New Moon</b> are sacrificed, that is not possible. <b>Didn’t we say</b> above that the verse states with regard to the goat of the New Moon: “And He gave <b>it</b> to you to bear the sin of the congregation,” which indicates that <b>it bears,</b> i.e., atones for, that <b>sin but another does not bear</b> that <b>sin?</b>

### Part 3
<b>And if you would say: Let</b> the goats of the Festivals <b>atone for</b> that which the goat <b>of Yom Kippur</b> is brought, that is not possible. <b>Didn’t we say</b> above that the verse states with regard to the goat of Yom Kippur: “Aaron shall bring atonement upon its corners <b>once a year”</b> (Exodus 30:10)? The emphasis on “once a year” teaches that <b>this atonement</b> for this case <b>should be only once a year.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara explains: It must be that the goats of the Festivals atone for cases of defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods in which one did not have awareness, neither at the beginning nor at the end, because if not, <b>for what</b> other matter involving sacrificial foods <b>could they atone?</b>

### Part 5
<b>If</b> you say they atone <b>for</b> cases <b>in which</b> one <b>had awareness at the beginning and had awareness at the end,</b> then one can counter <b>that he is liable to</b> bring <b>an offering</b> to atone for his transgression, and therefore the goats of the Festivals will not atone for him. <b>If</b> you say they atone <b>for</b> cases <b>in which</b> one <b>had awareness at the beginning but did not have awareness at the end,</b> then one can counter <b>that</b> the <b>goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary <b>and Yom Kippur</b> itself <b>suspend</b> any punishment that he deserves until he becomes aware of his transgression. <b>If</b> you say they atone <b>for</b> cases <b>in which</b> one <b>did not have awareness at the beginning but did have awareness at the end,</b> then one can counter <b>that</b> the <b>goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed outside</b> the Sanctuary <b>atones.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Perforce,</b> they <b>atone only for</b> cases in <b>which</b> one <b>did not have awareness, neither at the beginning nor at the end.</b>

### Part 7
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> The <b>atonement</b> effected by <b>all the goats</b> offered as part of the additional offerings, i.e., those of the New Moons, Festivals, and Yom Kippur, <b>is the same.</b> They all atone for various cases of the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods.

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Ḥama bar Rabbi Ḥanina said: What is the reasoning of Rabbi Meir?</b> With regard to the goat of the Festivals (Numbers, chapters 28–29) <b>the verse</b> could have simply <b>stated: A goat,</b> but instead it states: <b>“And a goat,”</b> which teaches that <b>all the goats are juxtaposed, this</b> one <b>with that</b> one, as the use of the term <b>“and”</b> teaches that the second matter <b>adds to the first matter,</b> and that all the goats effect a similar atonement as the first one listed, that of the New Moon.

### Part 9
The Gemara questions this interpretation: Initially <b>it enters your mind</b> to explain that the atonement effected by <b>each and every one</b> of the goats of the Festivals is <b>derived from</b> the atonement effected by the goat <b>adjacent to it,</b> i.e., the one mentioned in the passage immediately preceding it: The atonement effected by the Passover goat from the atonement effected by the goat of the New Moon and the atonement effected by the <i>Shavuot</i> goat from the atonement effected by the Passover goat and so forth. <b>But</b> this is difficult, as <b>doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say:</b> With regard to <b>the entire Torah,</b> one <b>derives</b> a <i>halakha</i> <b>derived</b> via a juxtaposition <b>from</b> a <i>halakha</i> <b>derived</b> via a juxtaposition, <b>except for</b> <i>halakhot</i> concerning <b>consecrated</b> matters, <b>where</b> one <b>does not derive</b> a <i>halakha</i> <b>derived</b> via a juxtaposition <b>from</b> a <i>halakha</i> <b>derived</b> via a juxtaposition?

### Part 10
The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> because actually the atonement effected by <b>all of</b> the goats <b>is derived</b> directly <b>from</b> the atonement effected by <b>the first</b> goat, i.e., the goat of the New Moon.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: Rabbi Ḥama bar Rabbi Ḥanina’s explanation <b>works out well</b> for <b>all</b> the goats <b>with regard to which it is written: “And a goat,”</b> but <b>from where do we</b> derive what the goats of <b><i>Shavuot</i> and Yom Kippur</b> atone for, <b>as with regard to them it is not written: And a goat,</b> but simply: “A goat”?

### Part 12
<b>Rather, Rabbi Yona says: The verse states</b> at the end of the passage detailing the goats of the Festivals: <b>“These shall you offer to the Lord on your Festivals”</b> (Numbers 29:39); with this verse <b>all</b> the goats of <b>the Festivals are juxtaposed, this</b> one <b>with that</b> one, which indicates that they all atone for the same sins. The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> the <b>New Moon is not</b> regarded as <b>a Festival.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara refutes this: In <b>truth,</b> the <b>New Moon is also called a Festival, in accordance with what Abaye says</b> with regard to a different issue, <b>as Abaye says:</b> With regard to the month of <b>Tammuz</b> in <b>that year</b> during which the Jewish people sinned by accepting the slanderous report of the spies about Eretz Yisrael, the court <b>made it a full</b> month of thirty days, <b>as it is written: “He proclaimed a festival to crush my young men”</b> (Lamentations 1:15). Abaye understands the verse to mean that by extending the month of Tammuz by an extra day, by proclaiming that the thirtieth day should be celebrated as a New Moon in addition to the first day of the following month, it emerged that the acceptance of the spies’ report occurred on the ninth of Av, and not the eighth, thereby defining the ninth of Av as an ominous day for the Jewish people. From Abaye’s explanation it is apparent that the New Moon is also called a Festival.

### Part 14
The Gemara continues to analyze Rabbi Meir’s opinion: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: And</b> even though he holds that all the goats offered as part of the additional offerings effect atonement for the same sin, <b>Rabbi Meir concedes with regard to</b> the <b>goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary on Yom Kippur <b>that it does not atone their atonement,</b> i.e., does not atone for the sins that they atone for, <b>and they do not atone its atonement.</b>

### Part 15
He elaborates: <b>It does not atone their atonement,</b> because, as the Gemara derived from the verse: “Aaron shall bring atonement upon its corners once a year” (Exodus 30:10), the internal goat <b>effects one atonement</b> for only one case <b>but cannot effect two atonements</b> for two different cases. And <b>they do not atone its atonement,</b> because, as the Gemara explained, <b>the verse states:</b> “Aaron shall bring atonement upon its corners <b>once a year.”</b> The emphasis on the phrase “once a year” teaches that <b>this atonement</b> for the specific case that it atones for <b>should be only once a year.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara adds: <b>This</b> qualification of Rabbi Meir’s opinion <b>is also</b> indicated by that which is <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>For</b> cases of the defiling of the Temple <b>in which</b> one <b>did not have awareness, neither at the beginning nor at the end, and for</b> cases <b>in which</b> one <b>did not have awareness at the beginning but did have awareness at the end, and for a ritually pure person who partook of ritually impure</b> sacrificial food, the <b>goats of the Festivals and</b> the <b>goats of</b> the <b>New Moons and</b> the <b>goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed outside</b> the Sanctuary <b>atone.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara notes: <b>But</b> in delineating which offerings atone, Rabbi Meir <b>omitted</b> the <b>goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary, <b>and</b> furthermore, when delineating <b>their atonement,</b> i.e., what cases they atone for, <b>he also omitted it,</b> i.e., he did not mention the cases that the internal goat atones for, which are the cases in which one had awareness at the beginning but did not have awareness at the end. Evidently, the atonement of the internal goat is substantively different from the atonement of the other goats.

### Part 18
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Shimon would say:</b> The <b>goats of</b> the <b>New Moons atone for a ritually pure</b> person <b>who</b> unwittingly <b>partook of ritually impure</b> sacrificial food. And for defiling the Temple or its sacrificial foods, the goats of the Festivals atone for cases in which one did not have awareness, neither at the beginning nor at the end, and the goats of the additional offerings of Yom Kippur atone for cases in which one did not have awareness at the beginning but did have awareness at the end.

### Part 19
The Gemara challenges: <b>Granted,</b> the goats <b>of</b> the <b>New Moons do not atone for</b> that which the goats <b>of Festivals</b> atone, <b>as the verse states</b> with regard to the goat of the New Moon: “And he gave it to you to bear the <b>sin</b> of the congregation” (Leviticus 10:17), which indicates that <b>it bears,</b> i.e., atones for, <b>one sin but does not bear two sins. But</b> nevertheless, <b>let</b> the goats <b>of</b> the <b>Festivals atone for</b> that which the goats <b>of New Moons atone.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>The verse states:</b> “He gave <b>it</b> to you.” The emphasis on “it” teaches that <b>it bears</b> this <b>sin, but no other</b> offering <b>bears</b> this <b>sin.</b>

### Part 20
The Gemara challenges: <b>Granted,</b> the goats <b>of</b> the <b>Festivals do not atone for</b> that which the goats <b>of Yom Kippur</b> atone, <b>as the verse states</b> with regard to the goat of Yom Kippur: “Aaron shall bring atonement upon its corners <b>once a year”</b> (Exodus 30:10). The emphasis on the phrase “once a year” teaches that <b>this atonement,</b> i.e., the specific case it atones for, <b>should be only once a year. But</b> nevertheless, <b>let</b> the goats <b>of Yom Kippur atone for</b> that which the goats <b>of</b> the <b>Festivals</b> atone. The Gemara responds: <b>The verse states: “Once</b> a year,” which indicates that it <b>effects one atonement</b> for only one case <b>but cannot effect two atonements</b> for two different cases.

### Part 21
The Gemara challenges the use of these derivations: <b>But when it states “once”</b> in this verse, <b>it is with regard to</b> the <b>goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary <b>that it is written,</b> so the derivations from it should have no bearing on the discussion concerning the external goat. The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states:</b> “One goat for a sin-offering <b>aside from</b>
