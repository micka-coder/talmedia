<b>importuning [<i>mesarevin</i>] him to eat.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara explains: <b>The mishna</b> here is referring to a case <b>where</b> others <b>are not importuning him to eat;</b> therefore, his oath should be understood literally, as obligating himself to eat. The <b>external</b> mishna, in tractate <i>Nedarim</i>, is referring to a case <b>where</b> others <b>are importuning him to eat and he is saying: I will not eat, I will not eat.</b> Under those circumstances, <b>when he takes an oath, this</b> is what he <b>is saying:</b> On my <b>oath I will not eat.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rav Ashi,</b> offering a different resolution of the contradiction, <b>says: Teach,</b> i.e., revise the mishna in tractate <i>Nedarim</i> to say in the middle oath: On my <b>oath I will not [<i>she’i</i>] eat of yours,</b> i.e., using a different formulation for: On my oath I will not eat of yours. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, what</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> what is effectively the same oath twice? The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that there is a concern that the oath was <b>a slip of his tongue</b> and he meant to take an oath that he will eat and instead said: I will not eat, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that one need not be concerned that this is what occurred.

### Part 4
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> “The <b>clear utterance</b> of her lips, with which she has bound her soul” (Numbers 30:7), is referring to <b>an oath,</b> and: <b>“A bond</b> with which she has bound her soul” (Numbers 30:5), is also referring to <b>an oath.</b> With regard to <b>the prohibition</b> invoked by the word <b>“bond,” if you say a bond is an oath,</b> he is <b>liable, but if not,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b> The Gemara seeks to explicate this <i>baraita</i>: <b>If you say a bond is an oath? But you</b> already <b>said</b> that <b>a bond is an oath.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Abaye said: This</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: “Clear utterance”</b> is <b>an oath,</b> whereas <b>“bond” is</b> the <b>association</b> of some object or action <b>with</b> a matter that has already been prohibited by <b>an oath.</b> What is the <b>prohibition</b> invoked by the word <b>“bond”? If you say</b> that creating <b>an association with an oath is like</b> explicitly <b>expressing an oath with his</b> own <b>mouth</b> then he is <b>liable</b> to bring an offering for unwittingly violating the oath and to receive lashes for doing so intentionally. <b>But if</b> it is <b>not</b> like stating an oath explicitly, he is <b>exempt.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara analyzes Abaye’s explanation: <b>From where</b> may one derive that <b>“clear utterance” is an oath?</b> One derives it from the verse written with regard to an oath on an utterance, <b>as it is written: “Or if anyone take an oath to clearly utter with his lips”</b> (Leviticus 5:4). The Gemara asks: Isn’t <b>“bond” also</b> referring to an oath, <b>as it is written: “Every vow, and every oath of a bond</b> to afflict the soul, her husband may let it stand, or her husband may make it void” (Numbers 30:14)?

### Part 7
<b>Rather, from where</b> may one derive <b>that a bond is</b> the <b>association</b> of some object or action <b>with</b> another matter that has been prohibited by <b>an oath?</b> One may derive it from the verse, <b>as it is written: “Or bound her soul by a bond with an oath”</b> (Numbers 30:11), which indicates that the bond is associated with a preexisting oath.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: Isn’t the term <b>“clear utterance” also</b> associated with an oath in a verse, as <b>it is written: “Whatsoever it be that a man shall utter clearly with an oath”</b> (Leviticus 5:4)?

### Part 9
<b>Rather, Abaye said:</b> The fact that <b>“clear utterance”</b> means <b>an oath</b> is derived <b>from here: “And if she be married to a husband, while her vows are upon her, or the clear utterance of her lips, with which she has bound her soul”</b> (Numbers 30:7). <b>While</b> in that verse, it <b>does not state: Oath. With what does she impose a prohibition upon herself?</b> She does so <b>with “clear utterance,”</b> indicating that “clear utterance” is referring to an oath.

### Part 10
<b>Rava said: Actually, I will say to you</b> that <b>association with an oath is not like expressing an oath with one’s</b> own <b>mouth, and this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: “Clear utterance”</b> is <b>an oath. “Bond”</b> can <b>also</b> be <b>an oath,</b> but it is ambiguous. <b>The verse placed</b> the wording of <b>the prohibition of a bond between</b> that of <b>a vow and</b> that of <b>an oath.</b> Therefore, if one <b>expressed</b> a bond <b>with the language of a vow,</b> it is <b>a vow.</b> If one expressed it <b>with the language of an oath,</b> it is <b>an oath.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>Where did</b> the verse <b>place</b> the word for “bond” between a vow and an oath? The verse says: <b>“And if she vowed in her husband’s house or bound her soul by a bond with an oath”</b> (Numbers 30:11).

### Part 12
The Gemara comments: Abaye and Rava both <b>follow their</b> own lines of <b>reasoning, as it was stated:</b> With regard to one who <b>associates</b> some object or action <b>with</b> another matter that has been prohibited by <b>an oath, Abaye says:</b> It <b>is like</b> explicitly <b>expressing an oath with his mouth, and Rava says: It is not like</b> explicitly <b>expressing an oath with his mouth.</b>

### Part 13
<b>The Gemara raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is the bond mentioned in the Torah?</b> A bond applies to <b>one who says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me that I will not eat meat and that I will not drink wine like</b> on <b>the day that his,</b> i.e., my, <b>father died,</b> or: <b>Like</b> on <b>the day that so-and-so died,</b> or: <b>Like</b> on <b>the day that Gedaliah ben Ahikam was killed,</b> or: <b>Like</b> on <b>the day</b> on <b>which he saw Jerusalem in its destruction.</b> One who makes one of these pronouncements is <b>prohibited</b> from eating meat and drinking wine. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> This <b>is</b> the case only <b>when he is prohibited</b> from eating meat and drinking wine <b>by vow since that day,</b> e.g., the day his father died.

### Part 14
The Gemara explains the objection: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Abaye, from</b> the fact that a vow <b>that one associates with</b> another <b>vow</b> is considered <b>a vow,</b> as Shmuel’s ruling demonstrates, one may conclude that an oath that <b>one associates with</b> another <b>oath</b> is considered <b>an oath.</b>
