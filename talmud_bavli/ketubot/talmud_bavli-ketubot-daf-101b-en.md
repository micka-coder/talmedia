her right to <b>her worn clothes</b> that are in <b>existence.</b> She retains possession of her clothes and all of the other items that she brought with her to the marriage that have not been worn out.

### Part 2
<b>The <i>tanna</i> teaches</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Naḥman:</b> A woman who <b>was licentious lost</b> her right to <b>her extant, worn clothes,</b> i.e., when they divorce, she does not keep her clothing. <b>He said to him: If she</b> was unfaithful and <b>engaged in sexual intercourse</b> with another, <b>were her items</b> also <b>licentious?</b> Certainly she is not penalized by losing her right to her property, and therefore <b>teach</b> the opposite: A woman who was licentious <b>has not lost</b> her right to <b>her extant worn clothes.</b>

### Part 3
Similarly, <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This</b> <i>baraita</i> taught by the <i>tanna</i> <b>is the statement of Rabbi Menaḥem, the unattributed,</b> as his opinion is cited in several places as the unattributed mishna. <b>However, the Rabbis say</b> that if <b>she was licentious, she has not lost</b> her right to <b>her extant worn clothes.</b>

### Part 4
§ The mishna teaches that <b>if, from the start, he married</b> her with the understanding that she is an <i>ailonit</i>, she is entitled to payment of her marriage contract. <b>Rav Huna said: An <i>ailonit</i></b> is <b>a wife and she is not a wife,</b> while <b>a widow</b> who is married to a High Priest is <b>entirely a wife.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara explains: <b>An <i>ailonit</i></b> is sometimes treated as <b>a wife and she</b> is sometimes <b>not</b> treated as <b>a wife.</b> How so? If <b>he knew about her</b> that she was an <i>ailonit</i> before marrying her, <b>she is entitled to</b> payment of her <b>marriage contract</b> like any other wife. But if <b>he did not know about her</b> that she was an <i>ailonit</i> before marrying her, <b>she is not entitled to</b> payment of her <b>marriage contract. A widow</b> is <b>entirely</b> considered <b>a wife. Whether he knew about her</b> that she was a widow before marrying her <b>whether he did not know</b> this <b>about her, she is entitled to</b> payment of her <b>marriage contract.</b>

### Part 6
<b>And Rav Yehuda says: Both the</b> <i>ailonit</i> and <b>the</b> widow are sometimes treated as <b>a wife and</b> sometimes <b>not</b> treated as <b>a wife.</b> Even in the case of a widow who marries a High Priest, if <b>he knew about her</b> that she was a widow before marrying her, <b>she is entitled to</b> payment of her <b>marriage contract.</b> But if <b>he did not know about her</b> that she was a widow, <b>she is not entitled to</b> payment of her <b>marriage contract.</b>

### Part 7
<b>The Gemara raises an objection</b> to Rav Huna’s statement from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>he married</b> the woman <b>with the presumption that she is so,</b> that she has some deficiency or that she is forbidden to him, <b>and it is found that she is so</b> as he thought from the start, then <b>she is entitled to</b> payment of her <b>marriage contract.</b> One can infer from here: If he married her <b>without specification,</b> and it turns out that she has a deficiency or that she is forbidden to him, <b>she is not entitled to</b> payment of her <b>marriage contract.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: <b>Do not say</b> this implies <b>that</b> if he married her <b>without specification she is not entitled to</b> payment of her <b>marriage contract. Rather, say</b> the following inference: If <b>he married her with the presumption that she is not so and it is found that she is so, she is not entitled to</b> payment of her <b>marriage contract.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if he married her <b>without specification, what</b> would the <i>halakha</i> be? The <i>halakha</i> would be that <b>she is entitled</b> to payment of her marriage contract. If that is the case, instead <b>of teaching</b> the case where he married her <b>with the presumption that she is so and she is found to be so</b> and <b>she is entitled to</b> payment of her <b>marriage contract, let him teach us</b> the case where he marries her <b>without specification.</b> If in a case where he marries her without specification she is entitled to payment of her marriage contract, then <b>all the more so</b> in <b>this</b> case, where he marries her knowingly, she must be entitled to it.

### Part 10
<b>And further,</b> it <b>is taught</b> explicitly in another <i>baraita</i>: If <b>he married her knowing</b> that she has a deficiency, <b>and it is found</b> that she does have the deficiency <b>as was known, she is entitled to</b> payment of her <b>marriage contract.</b> If he married her <b>without specification, she is not entitled to</b> payment of her <b>marriage contract.</b> This is <b>a conclusive refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara explains: <b>Rav Huna was misled by</b> the language of <b>the mishna</b> and made an inference that caused him to say something that is not in keeping with the <i>halakha</i>. <b>He thought that since</b> the mishna <b>differentiates</b> between a case where the husband was aware of her situation and a case where he was not aware <b>with</b> regard to <b>an <i>ailonit</i>, but</b> the mishna <b>does not differentiate with</b> regard to <b>a widow, by inference</b> one can say <b>that</b> with regard to <b>a widow, even where</b> one merely marries her without knowing that she is a widow, <b>she is entitled</b> to payment of her marriage contract. In truth, however, <b>that is not so. When</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>of the widow, it</b> is based <b>on the differentiation</b> stated <b>with</b> regard to <b>the <i>ailonit</i>.</b> The mishna intended for the distinction between whether the husband was aware of her situation before the marriage, which was stated in the case of an <i>ailonit</i>, to apply in the case of the widow as well.
