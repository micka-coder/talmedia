### Part 1
<b>Four hundred dinars of</b> this <b>wine</b> you should give <b>to</b> my <b>daughter,</b> and <b>the wine</b> subsequently <b>appreciated</b> in value, so that some money remained. <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> The <b>gain</b> goes <b>to the</b> male <b>orphans,</b> i.e., they are entitled to the leftover sum.

### Part 2
The Gemara relates: <b>The relatives of Rabbi Yoḥanan had a wife of</b> their <b>father who would diminish</b> his resources by spending wastefully on her <b>sustenance. They came before Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> to ask his advice. <b>He said to them: Go and say to your father that he should set aside</b> a certain portion of <b>land for her sustenance.</b> If she agrees to accept this land for her sustenance she has thereby relinquished her claim to the rest of the estate.

### Part 3
After their father died, <b>they came before Reish Lakish</b> for his ruling, and he <b>said to them: All the more so, he has increased</b> the sources of <b>sustenance</b> available <b>to her.</b> In other words, they are still obligated to support her from their father’s estate according to the lifestyle she is accustomed to living, and if they do not, she may use the field to supplement what they give her. <b>They said to him: But Rabbi Yoḥanan did not say so. He said to them: Go</b> and <b>give her</b> all she requires, <b>and if not, I will remove for you Rabbi Yoḥanan from your ears,</b> i.e., I will treat you so harshly that you will forget Rabbi Yoḥanan’s ruling. <b>They approached Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> to complain, but <b>he said to them: What can I do?</b> I cannot impose my opinion, <b>as</b> a man <b>equal to me disagrees with me.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Abbahu said:</b> This matter <b>was explained to me personally by Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b> All depends on the husband’s description of the land. If <b>he said</b> that he is giving her land <b>for</b> her <b>sustenance, he has</b> thereby <b>increased</b> the sources of <b>sustenance</b> available <b>to her.</b> He will continue to provide her sustenance, but if that amount is insufficient he has also set aside an area of land specifically for that purpose. However, if <b>he said</b> to her that he is designating the land <b>as</b> her <b>sustenance, he has</b> thereby <b>fixed</b> this plot of land as the only source of <b>sustenance</b> available <b>to her,</b> and she can take no more.
