### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In a case where witnesses testify that there are <b>two women who were taken captive,</b> and <b>this</b> woman <b>says: I was taken captive but I am pure, and that</b> woman <b>says: I was taken captive but I am pure, they are not deemed credible. And when this</b> woman <b>testifies about that</b> woman that she is pure and vice versa, <b>they are deemed credible.</b>

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (2:2): If one of the women says: <b>I am tainted and my counterpart is pure, she is deemed credible</b> on both counts. If she says: <b>I am pure and my counterpart is tainted, she is not deemed credible</b> with regard to herself nor with regard to her counterpart. If she says: <b>I and my counterpart are</b> both <b>tainted, she is deemed credible with regard to herself but she is not deemed credible with regard to her counterpart.</b> If she says: <b>I and my counterpart are</b> both <b>pure, she is deemed credible with regard to her counterpart but she is not deemed credible with regard to herself.</b>

### Part 3
<b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that if she says: <b>I am pure and my counterpart is tainted, she is not deemed credible.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances? If there are no witnesses</b> that she was taken captive, <b>why is she not deemed credible with regard to herself?</b> If she is saying: <b>I was taken captive and I am pure,</b> she is deemed credible based on the principle that the mouth that prohibited is the mouth that permitted. Rather, it is <b>obvious that there are witnesses</b> that she was taken captive.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>say the middle clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: If she says: <b>I and my counterpart are</b> both <b>tainted, she is deemed credible with regard to herself but she is not deemed credible with regard to her counterpart. And if there are witnesses, why is she not deemed credible</b> with regard to her counterpart? Once there is testimony that she was taken captive, she no longer has the presumptive status of purity. Rather, it is <b>obvious that there are no witnesses</b> that she was taken captive, and therefore her presumptive status of purity is intact.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>say the last clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: If she says: <b>I and my counterpart are</b> both <b>pure, she is deemed credible with regard to her counterpart but she is not deemed credible with regard to herself. And if there are no witnesses</b> that they were taken captive, <b>why is she not deemed credible with regard to herself?</b> Rather, it is <b>obvious that there are witnesses.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: Is that to say that the <i>baraita</i> is formulated in an unusual fashion, with the <b>first clause and the last clause</b> pertaining to cases <b>where there are witnesses, and the middle clause</b> pertaining to a case <b>where there are no witnesses? Abaye said: Yes,</b> the <b>first clause and the last clause</b> pertain to cases <b>where there are witnesses, and the middle clause</b> pertains to a case <b>where there are no witnesses.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> in <b>its entirety</b> can be explained in a case <b>where there are witnesses, and there is one witness who is</b> testifying to the <b>reverse</b> of the woman’s claim. If the woman <b>said: I am tainted and my counterpart is pure, and one witness said to her: You are pure and your counterpart is tainted,</b> although the witness testified that she was pure, because she admitted that she was tainted <b>she rendered herself an entity of prohibition. Her counterpart is permitted on the basis of her</b> claim, which is accepted despite being contradicted by the witness.

### Part 8
If the woman said: <b>I am pure and my counterpart is tainted, and one witness said to her: You are tainted and your counterpart is pure,</b> then with regard to <b>her, since there are witnesses</b> testifying that she was taken captive, <b>it is not in her power</b> to permit herself on the basis of her claim. However, <b>her counterpart is permitted on the basis of the</b> testimony of the <b>witness.</b>

### Part 9
If the woman said: <b>I and my counterpart are</b> both <b>tainted, and one witness said to her: You and your friend are</b> both <b>pure, she rendered herself an entity of prohibition.</b> However, <b>her counterpart is permitted on the basis of the</b> testimony of the <b>witness.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>this additional</b> case? <b>This is</b> identical <b>to</b> that which was taught in the in the <b>first clause.</b> The principles governing the first two cases, i.e., she claims that she is tainted and thereby renders herself as an entity of prohibition, and her counterpart is permitted by the testimony of one witness even if that testimony is contradicted, also apply in this case.

### Part 10
The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that in this case, <b>both of them are</b> deemed <b>untainted</b> in accordance with the testimony of the witness, <b>and</b> the fact <b>that she said that</b> they are both tainted <b>was</b> because <b>she was acting</b> with the intention termed: <b>“Let me die with the Philistines”</b> (Judges 16:30), i.e., she was willing to implicate herself in order to bolster her credibility so that her testimony against her counterpart would be accepted, the <i>tanna</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that this is not a consideration.

### Part 11
If the woman said: <b>I and my counterpart are</b> both <b>pure, and one witness said to her: You and your counterpart are</b> both <b>tainted,</b> with regard to <b>her, since there are witnesses</b> testifying that she was taken captive, <b>it is not in her power</b> to permit herself on the basis of her claim. However, <b>her counterpart is permitted on the basis of her</b> claim. The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>this additional</b> case? <b>This is</b> identical <b>to</b> that which was taught in the <b>first part of the first clause.</b> The principles governing the first two cases, i.e., her claim that she is pure is not accepted when the fact that she was taken captive was established by witnesses, and her counterpart is permitted on the basis of her claim even if that claim is contradicted, also apply in this case.

### Part 12
The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>when is she deemed credible</b> to permit her counterpart, it is only in a case <b>where she rendered herself unfit</b> to marry a priest, <b>but</b> in a case <b>where she rendered herself fit, say that she is not deemed credible</b> with regard to her counterpart; the <i>tanna</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that each segment of the testimony is assessed independently, based on the criteria taught in the first clause.

### Part 13
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>And likewise,</b> with regard to <b>two men</b> whose lineage is unknown, and <b>this</b> man <b>says: I am a priest, and that</b> man <b>says: I am a priest, they are not deemed credible. And when this</b> man <b>testifies about that</b> man that he is a priest and vice versa, <b>they are deemed credible. Rabbi Yehuda says: One does not elevate</b> a man <b>to priesthood on the basis of one witness.</b> Two witnesses are required for that purpose. <b>Rabbi Elazar says: When</b> is that the ruling? In a case <b>where there are challengers</b> to his claim that he is a priest. <b>However,</b> in a case <b>where there are no challengers, one elevates</b> a man <b>to priesthood on the basis of one witness. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says in the name of Rabbi Shimon, son of the deputy</b> High Priest: <b>One elevates</b> a man <b>to priesthood on the basis of one witness.</b>

### Part 14
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>all these</b> different cases cited in the <i>mishnayot</i> in this chapter? Aren’t they all based on the principle: The mouth that prohibited is the mouth that permitted? The Gemara answers: These cases are all <b>necessary, as, if</b> the <i>tanna</i> had <b>taught</b> only the case where <b>Rabbi Yehoshua concedes, in</b> a case where one says to another: This field, which is currently in my possession, belonged to your father, and I purchased it from him, then one might have thought that his claim is deemed credible <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that there is financial significance [<i>derara</i>]</b> in his contention that it belonged to the other’s father, and he would not have made that claim if it were not true. However, in the case of witnesses authenticating their signatures, <b>where there is no financial significance</b> for them in their testimony, <b>say no,</b> their claim is not accepted.

### Part 15
<b>And if</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taugh</b>t only the case of <b>witnesses,</b> one might have thought that their claim is deemed credible <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> their testimony is relevant <b>to others. However,</b> with regard to <b>him, whose</b> testimony is relevant <b>to himself,</b> as he claims that he purchased the field from the other’s father,
