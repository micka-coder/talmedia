<b>he should place his finger,</b> which is shaped like a peg, <b>into his ears. And that is what Rabbi Elazar said: Why are the fingers of a person similar to pegs?</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that Rabbi Elazar said that fingers are like pegs? <b>If we say</b> that it is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that they are discrete</b> from each other, <b>each and every</b> finger <b>was designated for its</b> own discrete, sacred <b>matter, as the Master said: This</b> small finger is for measuring <b>a span,</b> the distance between the little finger to the tip of the thumb used in measuring the breastplate of the High Priest; <b>this</b> next finger is used for taking <b>a fistful</b> of the meal-offering; <b>this</b> middle finger is used for measuring <b>a cubit,</b> the distance from the elbow to the tip of the middle finger; <b>this</b> one next to the thumb is the <b>finger</b> used to sprinkle the blood of offerings on the altar; <b>this</b> is the <b>thumb,</b> on which the blood and oil is placed in the purification ritual of a leper.

### Part 2
<b>Rather,</b> the question is: <b>What is the reason that they are pointed like pegs?</b> It is so <b>that if a person hears an inappropriate matter, he will place his fingers in his ears.</b> Similarly, a Sage <b>of the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Why is the entire ear hard and the earlobe soft?</b> It is so <b>that if a person hears an inappropriate matter, he will bend his earlobe into</b> his ear to seal it. <b>The Sages taught: A person should not allow his ears to hear idle matters. Because</b> of the fact <b>that</b> ears are very sensitive and <b>are</b> the <b>first of the limbs burned,</b> one should make certain not to expose them to anything problematic.

### Part 3
§ <b>A dilemma was raised</b> before the Sages: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to engaging in intercourse</b> with one’s virgin bride <b>for the first time on Shabbat?</b> The dilemma is with regard to the nature of the blood that emerges as a result of the piercing of the hymen. Is it that the <b>blood is pooled,</b> and it is released once the hymen is pierced, so that no prohibition is violated? <b>Or,</b> is the blood flowing through vessels <b>attached</b> to the body, and it emerges as a result of a wound, so that he does violate a prohibition?

### Part 4
<b>And if you say</b> that <b>it is pooled</b> and the intercourse does not cause a wound, there is an additional dilemma: <b>Does</b> the husband <b>require the blood</b> to flow, and that is his objective in performing the act, in which case it is <b>permitted? Or, perhaps he requires the opening</b> caused by the rupture of the hymen, <b>and</b> creating that opening is <b>prohibited</b> on Shabbat.

### Part 5
<b>And if you say</b> that <b>he requires the blood, and the opening comes</b> about <b>incidentally</b> as an unintended consequence, <b>is the <i>halakha</i> in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who said: An unintentional act,</b> i.e., a permitted action from which a forbidden labor inadvertently ensued, <b>is permitted? Or, is the <i>halakha</i> in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who said: An unintentional act is forbidden?</b>

### Part 6
<b>And even if you say that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> in this regard, is this <b>a destructive</b> action <b>vis-à-vis the opening,</b> and is it consequently permitted on Shabbat because only constructive actions are forbidden? <b>Or, perhaps</b> it is <b>a constructive</b> action <b>vis-à-vis the opening.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Some say</b> that the series of dilemmas is as follows: <b>And if you say</b> that <b>the blood is</b> flowing through vessels <b>attached</b> to the body and emerges as a result of a wound, <b>does</b> the husband <b>require the blood,</b> and engaging in intercourse is consequently <b>prohibited,</b> as his intent is to cause the wound? <b>Or, perhaps he requires</b> the act of intercourse solely <b>for his own pleasure, and</b> it is <b>permitted.</b>

### Part 8
<b>And if you say that he requires</b> the act of intercourse solely <b>for his own pleasure, and the blood comes incidentally,</b> as it was not his intent to draw blood, <b>is the <i>halakha</i> in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> with regard to an unintentional act, <b>or</b> is it <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon?</b>

### Part 9
<b>And if you say</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> and unintentional acts are forbidden, is one <b>destructive in</b> causing the <b>wound</b> or <b>constructive in</b> causing the <b>wound?</b>

### Part 10
<b>And if you say</b> that he is <b>destructive in</b> causing the <b>wound, in</b> cases involving <b>destructive</b> acts <b>is the <i>halakha</i> in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who rules that one who performs any destructive act on Shabbat is exempt, even if he did so intentionally?
