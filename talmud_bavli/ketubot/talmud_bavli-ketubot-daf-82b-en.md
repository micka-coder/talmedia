### Part 1
The Gemara explains: It is necessary <b>lest you say</b> that <b>he has performed</b> the <b>mitzva the Merciful One placed upon him</b> by means of levirate marriage, <b>and now</b> that he has divorced her <b>she should</b> once again <b>stand</b> in relation <b>to him with the prohibition</b> proscribing <b>a brother’s wife,</b> which was her status before the mitzva of levirate marriage came into effect. The <i>tanna</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that since he performed levirate marriage with her, the prohibition proscribing a brother’s wife no longer applies at all.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>And say</b> that <b>indeed,</b> the prohibition proscribing a brother’s wife should be in force once again. The Gemara explains: <b>The verse states: “And he will take her to him to be his wife”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5), which indicates that once <b>he has taken her, she has become like his</b> regular <b>wife</b> in all respects.

### Part 3
§ The mishna taught: She has the status of his wife in all respects after levirate marriage, <b>except that</b> the responsibility for <b>her marriage contract is upon the property of her first husband.</b> The Gemara inquires: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is that <b>from Heaven they acquired a wife for him.</b> Since he did not choose her but married her by force of a Torah commandment, he is not obligated to set aside for her a marriage contract of his own. Rather, he relies upon his brother’s marriage contract.

### Part 4
The Gemara adds: <b>And if she does not have</b> anything <b>from the first</b> husband, e.g., if he owned no property, <b>she</b> nevertheless <b>has</b> a marriage contract <b>from the second</b> one, for the same reason that any wife is entitled to a marriage contract in the first place: <b>So that she will not be demeaned in his eyes such that</b> he will easily <b>divorce her.</b>

### Part 5
The mishna further stated that the <i>yavam</i> <b>may not say to her: Here is your marriage contract,</b> and similarly, a man may not make such a statement to his wife. Rather, all of his property is mortgaged for her marriage contract. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the relevance of the phrase: <b>And similarly,</b> here? The <i>halakha</i> in both cases appears to be identical.

### Part 6
The Gemara explains: It is necessary <b>lest you say</b> that this <b>is</b> the <i>halakha</i> only <b>there,</b> with regard to a <i>yevama</i>, <b>where</b> the <i>yavam</i> did <b>not write</b> a marriage contract <b>for her</b> and therefore never wrote: All property <b>that I have bought and that I will buy</b> is mortgaged to the marriage contract. <b>But here,</b> with regard to a regular wife, <b>where he did write</b> a marriage contract <b>for her</b> that included the clause: <b>That I have bought and that I will buy, say that she relies</b> upon that which he has set aside, and therefore there is no need for a full lien on all his property. The <i>tanna</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case.

### Part 7
§ The mishna states that if <b>he divorced her she has only her marriage contract.</b> There is no lien upon the property, and he may therefore sell it. The Gemara infers: If <b>he divorced her, yes,</b> that is the case, but if <b>he did not divorce her, no,</b> it is not. The <i>tanna</i> here <b>teaches us</b> indirectly that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with Rabbi Abba,</b> who claims that the only way he can gain full control of all the property is by divorcing her.

### Part 8
It was further taught in the mishna that if he <b>remarried her, she is like all women, and she has nothing other</b> than <b>her marriage contract.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaching us</b> by mentioning the possibility that he <b>remarried her? We</b> already <b>learned</b> this: With regard to <b>one who divorces a woman and remarries her, he remarries her on the basis of</b> her <b>first marriage contract,</b> and he need not write her a new one. Why is it necessary to emphasize this <i>halakha</i> in the case of a <i>yevama</i>?

### Part 9
The Gemara answers: It is necessary <b>lest you say</b> that <b>it is</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case of <b>a wife, since he writes for her a marriage contract from him,</b> and therefore when he remarries her he does so on the basis of the first marriage contract. <b>But</b> as for <b>his <i>yevama</i>, where he did not write for her</b> the marriage contract but it was written by his brother, in a case <b>where he divorced her and remarried her, say</b> that <b>her marriage contract</b> should be <b>from him</b> and he should write a new one using his own property. Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this is not required.

### Part 10
§ The Gemara discusses the background for the rule that the husband’s property is mortgaged for the marriage contract. <b>Rav Yehuda said: At first they would write for a virgin two hundred</b> dinars <b>and for a widow one hundred dinars.</b> They would then demand that this amount be available in cash, <b>and</b> then the men <b>would grow old and would not marry women,</b> as they did not all possess such large sums of money, <b>until Shimon ben Shataḥ came and instituted</b> an ordinance that a man need not place the money aside in practice. Rather, <b>all of his property is guaranteed for her marriage contract.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara comments: <b>That</b> opinion <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>At first they would write for a virgin two hundred and for a widow one hundred dinars, and they would grow old and would not marry women,</b> since the women were concerned that their marriage contract money would be wasted or lost, and they had no guarantee that it would be collected. The Sages therefore <b>instituted</b> an ordinance <b>that they should place it,</b> the sum of the marriage contract, <b>in her father’s house,</b> thereby ensuring its safekeeping. <b>And still</b> problems arose, as <b>when he was angry at</b> his wife, he would <b>say to her: Go to your marriage contract,</b> as it was too easy for them to divorce.

### Part 12
Therefore, the Sages <b>instituted</b> an ordinance <b>that they would place it in her father-in-law’s house,</b> i.e., in her husband’s house. And <b>wealthy</b> women <b>would craft</b> their marriage contract money into <b>baskets of silver and of gold,</b> while <b>poor</b> ones <b>would craft it</b> into <b>a large vessel</b> for the collection <b>of urine,</b> as their marriage contract was large enough only for a small vessel.

### Part 13
<b>And still, when he was angry at her he</b> would <b>say to her: Take your marriage contract and leave, until Shimon ben Shataḥ came and instituted</b> an ordinance <b>that</b> he does not actually give her the money for her marriage contract. Rather, <b>he should write to her: All my property is guaranteed for her marriage contract,</b> and it is not localized to a particular place or object. Consequently, he would need to sell some of his property if he wished to divorce her, and would therefore think carefully before undertaking such a drastic course of action.
