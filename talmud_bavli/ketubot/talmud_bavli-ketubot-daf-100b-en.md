### Part 1
<b>Everyone who buys from the court buys with</b> the implicit <b>understanding that</b> the sale <b>generates publicity,</b> as a court sale is conducted in public with notices. The buyer could therefore think to himself that if no claimants came forward until the time of the actual purchase, then it is certain that there can be no problem with his purchase and he forgoes his property guarantee. Lest you say this, Rav Yosef <b>teaches us</b> that there is nevertheless a guarantee on the property, and it rests upon the orphans and not on the court.

### Part 2
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says</b> that even if the judges err, the transaction is not void because of the prerogative of the court. The Gemara asks: <b>And to what</b> extent can they err without causing the deal to be reversed? <b>Rav Huna bar Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet said: Until half</b> of the value.

### Part 3
<b>That is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: A court that sold</b> property <b>worth one hundred dinars for two hundred</b> dinars, <b>or</b> property <b>worth two hundred</b> dinars <b>for one hundred dinars, their sale is valid.</b> Since he doesn’t give as an example a larger gap between the market value and the sale price, this must be the most extreme case in which the transaction is not reversed.

### Part 4
<b>Ameimar said in the name of Rav Yosef:</b> With regard to <b>a court that sold without an announcement,</b> it <b>is considered as</b> if <b>they erred in a matter</b> that appears in the <b>Mishna and</b> their decision is <b>reversed.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: Why does Rav Yosef say that it <b>is considered as</b> if the court erred in a matter that appears in the Mishna, when <b>it certainly erred</b> in this manner? <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Arakhin</i> 21b): The <b>assessment</b> of <b>the orphans</b> is for <b>thirty days, and the assessment</b> for <b>consecrated property</b> is for <b>sixty days, and they make announcements</b> during the thirty and the sixty days respectively both <b>in the morning and in the evening.</b> The mishna states explicitly that announcements must be made. If the court did not make the announcements, it clearly erred in a matter that appears in the Mishna.

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> all the information that I had were <b>from that</b> mishna, <b>I would say</b> that <b>this applies</b> to <b>an agent but not to a court.</b> Therefore, Rav Yosef <b>teaches us</b> that even a court that sold property without making announcements has erred.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Ashi raised an objection to</b> the statement of <b>Ameimar:</b> The mishna teaches that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>the assessment</b> of the value of a piece of property in order to sell it through <b>the judges</b> is as follows: In a case <b>where they decreased</b> the price by <b>one-sixth</b> of its market value <b>or added one-sixth</b> to its market value, <b>their sale is void.</b> One can see from here that if the judges sold the property <b>for its value, their sale is valid. What, is</b> the mishna <b>not</b> discussing a case where <b>no announcement was made?</b> Ameimar replied: <b>No,</b> the case under discussion is one <b>where they did make an announcement.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: Since <b>the last clause is</b> referring to a case <b>where</b> the court <b>made an announcement, the first clause</b> must be referring to a case <b>where they did not make announcements, as it teaches in the final clause: If they made a document of inspection</b> and announced the sale publicly, then <b>even if they sold</b> property <b>worth one hundred dinars for two hundred</b> dinars <b>or</b> property <b>worth two hundred</b> dinars <b>for one hundred dinars, their sale is valid.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rather,</b> this should be understood differently. <b>Actually,</b> the first clause of the mishna is referring to a case <b>where they did not make an announcement, and</b> this is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> Ameimar is referring <b>to items for which one makes an announcement,</b> and if this was not done then the sale is void. <b>There,</b> the mishna is speaking of <b>items for which one does not make announcements.</b>

### Part 10
<b>And these are</b> the <b>items for which one does not make an announcement: Slaves, movable property, and contracts.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>slaves</b> are sold without an announcement? Slaves are sold without an announcement <b>lest they hear</b> that they are about to be sold <b>and escape.</b> Why is the sale of <b>movable property and contracts</b> also not announced? <b>Lest they be stolen.</b>

### Part 11
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>here</b> Ameimar is referring to <b>a time when one makes an announcement,</b> while <b>there</b> the mishna is referring to <b>a time when one does not make an announcement.</b>

### Part 12
When does one not make an announcement? <b>As</b> the Sages <b>of Neharde’a say: For</b> the purpose of paying <b>head tax,</b> and <b>for</b> payment to provide for children’s <b>sustenance, and for burial,</b> the court <b>sells</b> property inherited by orphans <b>without an announcement</b> because these are pressing needs. There is no time to wait for an announcement.

### Part 13
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>here,</b> Ameimar is referring to <b>a locale where one makes an announcement,</b> while <b>there,</b> the mishna is referring to <b>a locale where one does not make an announcement, as Rav Naḥman said: They never made a document of inspection in Neharde’a.</b>

### Part 14
Some of the students <b>understood from</b> Rav Naḥman’s statement that no announcements were made in Neharde’a <b>because</b> the Sages there were all <b>expert in the appraisal</b> of an article’s value. <b>Rav Yosef bar Minyumi said to them:</b> This <b>was explained to me</b> personally <b>by Rav Naḥman himself:</b> It was <b>because</b> those who purchase the property <b>are called: People</b> who <b>consume property that was publicly announced.</b> This disparaging nickname was given because the purchasers were perceived as taking advantage of the distress of others by running to buy the property of someone in trouble. Since decent, honest people did not wish to buy property whose sale had been announced, they stopped making announcements.

### Part 15
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: Movable property that belongs to orphans is appraised and sold immediately</b> so that it not deteriorate over time. <b>Rav Ḥisda</b> said that <b>Avimi said:</b> The movable property <b>is sold on a market</b> day, when there are many potential buyers and the items will sell for a proper price.

### Part 16
The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> they do <b>not disagree</b> with each other. Rather, <b>this</b> opinion, that the items are sold on a market day, applies <b>when</b> the <b>market</b> day <b>is approaching,</b> so the property is not sold immediately. <b>That</b> opinion, that the items are sold immediately, applies <b>when</b> the <b>market</b> day <b>is far off.</b>

### Part 17
<b>Rav Kahana was in possession of beer</b> that belonged <b>to Rav Mesharshiyya bar Ḥilkai,</b> who was <b>an orphan. He delayed</b> selling <b>it until the Festival.</b> He explained the rationale for his actions and <b>said: Although</b> it is possible <b>that it may deteriorate [<i>itzatzta</i>]</b> and sour a little, <b>it</b> nevertheless <b>brings</b> in <b>money</b> at the time of the Festival, as it will sell for a higher price and for money, not credit. Consequently, it is in the best interests of Rav Mesharshiyya bar Ḥilkai to hold off and sell the beer at the next Festival.

### Part 18
It is also related that <b>Ravina was in possession of wine</b> belonging <b>to</b> the <b>orphan Ravina the younger,</b> who <b>was his sister’s son. He also had wine of his own,</b> which <b>he was taking to Sikhra</b> to sell.

### Part 19
<b>He came before Rav Ashi</b> and <b>said to him: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> here, am <b>I</b> able <b>to bring</b> his wine along <b>with</b> my wine, or must I wait for a more opportune time to sell it? <b>He said to him: Go</b> to Sikhra and take his wine along as well, as his <b>is no better than yours,</b> and if you sell your own wine in this manner, it is clear that you think this is the best way to sell, and it is permitted for you to sell his wine in this manner.

### Part 20
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> An orphan girl who was married off by her mother or brother before reaching the age of majority may refuse to continue living with her husband upon reaching the age of majority, thereby retroactively annulling their marriage. In the case of <b>one who refuses</b> to continue living with her husband in this manner; and in the case of a woman who is <b>a secondary</b> forbidden <b>relative</b> by rabbinic law; <b>and</b> in the case of <b>a sexually underdeveloped woman [<i>ailonit</i>],</b> who is incapable of bearing children, each of these women <b>is not entitled to</b> payment of <b>a marriage contract; and</b> they are <b>not</b> entitled to remuneration for the <b>produce</b> that the husband consumed; <b>and</b> they are <b>not</b> entitled to <b>sustenance; and</b> they are <b>not</b> entitled to their <b>worn clothes</b> that were brought in to the marriage as part of their dowry and became worn out during the marriage.

### Part 21
<b>If, from the start, he married her with the understanding</b> that she is <b>an <i>ailonit</i>,</b> then <b>she is entitled to</b> payment of <b>a marriage contract.</b>

### Part 22
In the case of <b>a widow</b> who married <b>a High Priest;</b> or <b>a divorcée or a <i>yevama</i> who performed <i>ḥalitza</i></b> and later married <b>a common priest;</b> or <b>a daughter born from an incestuous or adulterous relationship [<i>mamzeret</i>]</b> who married an Israelite; <b>or a Gibeonite woman</b> who married <b>an Israelite;</b> or <b>a Jewish woman</b> who married <b>a Gibeonite or a <i>mamzer</i>,</b> although each of these unions is prohibited by Torah law, the woman is still <b>entitled to</b> payment of <b>a marriage contract.</b>

### Part 23
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav taught</b> that <b>a minor girl</b> who was married off by her mother or by her brother and who <b>is divorced with a bill of divorce is not entitled to</b> her <b>marriage contract.</b> According to Torah law, this marriage never took effect, and it was never established that in this situation she would receive a marriage contract. <b>And all the more so, one who refuses</b> to continue living with her husband and annuls the marriage herself is not entitled to payment of a marriage contract.

### Part 24
<b>Shmuel taught</b> that <b>one who refuses</b> to continue living with her husband <b>is not entitled to</b> her <b>marriage contract, but one who is divorced with a bill of divorce is entitled to</b> her <b>marriage contract.</b>

### Part 25
The Gemara notes: <b>And Shmuel follows</b> his line of <b>reasoning, as Shmuel said: One who refuses</b> to continue living with her husband <b>is not entitled to</b> her <b>marriage contract,</b> but <b>one who is divorced with a bill of divorce is entitled to</b> her <b>marriage contract.</b>

### Part 26
Shmuel also said: <b>One who refuses</b> to continue living with her husband is <b>not disqualified from</b> marrying one of <b>the brothers</b> of her husband. Her refusal annuls the marriage, and it is as if it never happened. <b>And</b> for the same reason, unlike a divorcée, this girl <b>is not disqualified from</b> marrying a member of <b>the priesthood.</b> However, <b>one who is divorced with a bill of divorce</b> is <b>disqualified from</b> marrying one of <b>the brothers and</b> is also <b>disqualified from</b> marrying a member of <b>the priesthood.</b>

### Part 27
Another difference between a woman who refuses to continue living with her husband and a woman who was divorced normally is the following: <b>One who refuses</b> to continue living with her husband <b>does not need to wait three months</b> before remarrying, as other women who separate from their husbands must.
