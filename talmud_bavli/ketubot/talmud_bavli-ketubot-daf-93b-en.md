<b>the earnings are divided equally.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rabba said: Shmuel’s statement stands to reason</b> in a case <b>where</b> they bought <b>an ox for plowing and it was used for plowing,</b> and now they wish to divide the earnings from the work of the ox. Since each part of the ox is necessary in order to plow, each partner’s contribution is equally necessary. <b>However,</b> in a case <b>where</b> they purchased <b>an ox for plowing, but it was used for slaughter</b> and they wish to divide their income from the sale of the meat, <b>this</b> partner <b>takes</b> his portion <b>according to his monetary</b> investment <b>and that</b> partner <b>takes</b> his portion <b>according to his monetary</b> investment. <b>And Rav Hamnuna said: Even</b> in a case where they purchased <b>an ox for plowing and used</b> it <b>for slaughter, the earnings are divided equally.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rabba’s statement from the following <i>Tosefta</i>: In the case of <b>two</b> individuals <b>who deposited</b> money <b>into a purse,</b> i.e., invested in a joint business venture, <b>this</b> one invested <b>one hundred dinars and that</b> one invested <b>two hundred, the earnings are divided equally.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>What, is it not</b> referring to the case <b>of an ox</b> that was purchased <b>for plowing and was used for slaughter, and</b> it is <b>a conclusive refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> the <i>Tosefta</i> is referring only to the case <b>of an ox</b> that was purchased <b>for plowing and used for plowing.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>But in</b> the case of <b>an ox purchased for plowing and used for slaughter, what</b> is the opinion of the <i>Tosefta</i>; is it that <b>this</b> partner <b>takes</b> his portion <b>according to his monetary</b> investment <b>and that</b> partner <b>takes</b> his portion <b>according to his monetary</b> investment? If so, <b>rather than teaching the latter clause</b> of that same <i>Tosefta</i>, which reads as follows: If <b>this</b> partner <b>purchased</b> oxen <b>with his own</b> funds <b>and that</b> partner also purchased oxen <b>with his own</b> funds, <b>and they became mixed</b> when the two owners entered a joint business venture, <b>this</b> partner <b>takes</b> his portion <b>according to his monetary</b> investment <b>and that</b> partner <b>takes</b> his portion <b>according to his monetary</b> investment, it should teach a different case.

### Part 5
The Gemara explains: <b>Let</b> the <i>Tosefta</i> <b>distinguish and teach within the case</b> of the first clause <b>itself,</b> as follows: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said,</b> that the earnings are divided equally? <b>In</b> the case of <b>an ox</b> purchased <b>for plowing and used for plowing, but in</b> the case of <b>an ox</b> purchased <b>for plowing and used for slaughter, this</b> partner <b>takes</b> his portion <b>according to his monetary</b> investment <b>and that</b> partner <b>takes</b> his portion <b>according to his monetary</b> investment. Since the <i>Tosefta</i> did not make that distinction, it appears that it is dealing with both cases.

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: <b>That is indeed what</b> the <i>Tosefta</i> <b>is saying: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said? In</b> the case of <b>an ox</b> purchased <b>for plowing and used for plowing, but in</b> the case of <b>an ox</b> purchased <b>for plowing but used for slaughter, it becomes like</b> a case <b>where this</b> partner <b>purchased</b> oxen <b>with his own</b> funds <b>and that</b> partner purchased oxen <b>with his own</b> funds, <b>and they became mixed</b> when the two owners entered a joint business venture. The <i>halakha</i> in such a case is that <b>this</b> partner <b>takes</b> his portion <b>according to his monetary</b> investment <b>and that</b> partner <b>takes</b> his portion <b>according to his monetary</b> investment.

### Part 7
The Gemara presents another proof: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>Similarly, three</b> individuals <b>who deposited</b> money <b>into a purse,</b> i.e., invested different amounts of money into a joint business venture: If they <b>incurred a loss or earned a profit</b> and now choose to dissolve the partnership, <b>they divide</b> the assets <b>in this manner,</b> i.e., based upon the amount that each of them initially invested in the partnership.

### Part 8
<b>What, is it not</b> that when the mishna says: <b>They incurred a loss,</b> it means that <b>they incurred an actual loss,</b> and when it says: <b>They earned a profit,</b> it means that <b>they earned an actual profit,</b> and it says that they divide the assets proportionally and not equally? This poses a difficulty for Shmuel, who is of the opinion that they should divide the assets equally.

### Part 9
<b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said: No,</b> when the mishna says <b>they earned a profit,</b> it means that they received <b>new dinars,</b> i.e., coins, in place of the old ones they had started with, and these new coins were of greater value than the original ones. Similarly, when it says that <b>they incurred a loss,</b> it means that they received defective <b>coins</b> useful only <b>for a wound.</b> When they were dividing the money between themselves, they found some old coins, which had become rusty or invalidated by the government and therefore lost some or all of their value and were good for nothing other than scrap metal. When dividing the coins they are left with, they do so in proportion to their monetary stakes, but this does not apply to the actual profits they earned.

### Part 10
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who was married</b> to <b>four women and died, the</b> woman he married <b>first precedes the</b> woman he married <b>second</b> in claiming her marriage contract, <b>the second</b> precedes <b>the third, and the third</b> precedes <b>the fourth. And</b> the <b>first</b> wife <b>takes an oath to the second</b> that she has taken nothing from the jointly owned properties of the estate in an unlawful manner, <b>and</b> the <b>second</b> takes an oath <b>to the third, and</b> the <b>third to the fourth. The fourth</b> wife <b>is paid</b> her share <b>without</b> having to take <b>an oath. Ben Nanas says: Should she gain</b> this advantage merely <b>because she is last?</b> After all, she too is being paid from property that would otherwise go to the orphans. Rather, <b>she too is not paid without an oath.</b>

### Part 11
However, <b>if all of</b> the marriage contracts <b>were issued on the same day, whichever</b> wife’s marriage contract <b>precedes</b> that of <b>another, even by a single hour, has acquired</b> the right to be paid first. <b>And so,</b> the practice <b>in Jerusalem</b> was that <b>they would write the hours</b> when the documents had been signed on the documents, in order to enable the document holder to demonstrate that his or her document preceded that of another. If <b>all</b> the contracts <b>were issued in the same hour and there is only one hundred dinars</b> from which to pay all of them, all of the women <b>divide</b> the money <b>equally.</b>

### Part 12
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what do</b> the first <i>tanna</i> and ben Nanas <b>disagree? Shmuel said:</b>
