### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A virgin is married on Wednesday and a widow on Thursday.</b> The reason for the former is <b>that twice a week courts convene in the towns, on Monday and Thursday,</b> so <b>that if</b> the husband <b>had a claim concerning</b> the bride’s <b>virginity</b> when consummating the marriage on Wednesday night, <b>he would go early</b> the next day <b>to court</b> and make his claim.

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Yosef said</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: Due to what</b> reason <b>did they say that a virgin is married on Wednesday?</b> It is <b>because we learned</b> in a mishna elsewhere (57a): <b>If the time</b> that the groom designated for the wedding <b>arrived,</b> and the wedding was postponed, <b>and they were not married,</b> the brides are entitled to <b>eat from his</b> food <b>and,</b> if he is a priest, <b>eat <i>teruma</i>.</b>

### Part 3
<b>One might think</b> that if the designated <b>time arrived on Sunday,</b> and the wedding was postponed, <b>he would provide her sustenance</b> beginning on Sunday. <b>Therefore, we learned: A virgin is married on Wednesday.</b> Until Wednesday, the designated time is not considered to have arrived, even if the original date was earlier in the week.

### Part 4
After citing the statements above, <b>Rav Yosef said</b> in astonishment: <b>Lord of Abraham,</b> Shmuel <b>makes</b> that which <b>is taught dependent on</b> that which <b>is not taught,</b> using the latter to explain the former. The Gemara asks: <b>Which is taught and which is not taught?</b> Both <b>this</b> mishna <b>is taught</b> and <b>that</b> mishna <b>is taught.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> Shmuel <b>makes</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>is taught</b> in the mishna here, <b>whose reason is explicit, dependent on</b> a <i>halakha</i> that <b>is taught</b> in the later mishna, <b>whose reason is not explicit.</b> Citation of the later mishna contributed nothing to the understanding of the mishna here.

### Part 5
<b>Rather, if it was stated, this</b> is how <b>it was stated: Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: Due to what</b> reason <b>did</b> the Sages in the mishna <b>say</b> that <b>a virgin is married on Wednesday?</b> It is so <b>that if</b> the husband <b>had a claim concerning</b> the bride’s <b>virginity, he would go early</b> the next day <b>to court</b> and make his claim. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if that is the reason, <b>let her marry on Sunday, as</b> then too, <b>if</b> the husband <b>had a claim concerning</b> the bride’s <b>virginity, he would go early</b> the next day <b>to court</b> and make his claim. The Gemara answers: The <b>Sages were assiduous in seeing to the well-being of Jewish women</b> and instituted that the wedding take place on Wednesday, <b>so that</b> the groom <b>would exert</b> himself <b>in</b> arranging <b>the</b> wedding <b>feast for three days: Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, and on Wednesday, he marries her.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara continues: <b>And now that we learned</b> that the reason for the ruling in the mishna that a woman is married on Wednesday is that the Sages <b>were assiduous</b> in this matter, then with regard to <b>that</b> <i>halakha</i>, <b>which we learned</b> in the later mishna: <b>If the time arrived and they were not married,</b> the brides are entitled to <b>eat from his</b> food <b>and eat <i>teruma</i>,</b> one may conclude: <b>If</b> the <b>time arrived on Sunday, since</b> he is <b>unable to marry</b> her because he is busy preparing the wedding feast, <b>he is not obligated to provide her sustenance</b> until Wednesday.

### Part 7
<b>Therefore,</b> according to the same line of reasoning, if the husband <b>fell ill, or if</b> the bride <b>fell ill, or</b> in a case <b>where she began to menstruate [<i>peirsa nidda</i>]</b> and the wedding had to be postponed, he similarly need <b>not provide her sustenance</b> from the designated time, as he did not initiate the delay.

### Part 8
<b>And there are</b> those <b>who raised it as a dilemma: If</b> the groom <b>fell ill, what is</b> the ruling with regard to his obligation to provide her sustenance? <b>There,</b> in the case where the designated time arrived on Sunday, <b>what is the reason</b> that he is exempt? It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that he was forced</b> to postpone the wedding by circumstances beyond his control. <b>And here too, isn’t he forced</b> by circumstances beyond his control, and he should therefore be exempt? <b>Or, perhaps</b> there is a distinction between the cases. <b>There, he was forced by an ordinance that was instituted by the Sages</b> that a virgin marries on Wednesday, and they exempted him from providing for her until then. <b>However, here,</b> that is <b>not</b> the case. Therefore, despite the existence of circumstances beyond his control, he is not exempt from providing her sustenance due to his illness.

### Part 9
<b>And if you say that if he fell ill, he provides her sustenance</b> at the time designated for the wedding, then <b>if she fell ill, what is</b> the ruling? <b>Can he say to her: I am standing here</b> prepared to wed you, and if you are not prepared, it is not my fault? <b>Or perhaps she can say to him that his field was inundated,</b> i.e., her illness is tantamount to a natural disaster that befell him, and he must nevertheless provide for her.

### Part 10
<b>And if you say that</b> if she fell ill <b>she</b> can <b>say to him that his field was inundated,</b> if <b>she became a menstruating woman</b> and the wedding was postponed, <b>what is</b> the ruling? Is this too considered an unavoidable circumstance, like illness, and he must provide for her, or was this predictable?

### Part 11
If she began menstruating <b>at the time of her set period [<i>vista</i>], do not raise the dilemma,</b>
