### Part 1
Concerning Temple <b>service vessels, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the possibility <b>that they may be prepared by</b> using money <b>consecrated for Temple maintenance?</b> The Gemara explains the two sides of the dilemma: <b>Are they requirements of the altar, and</b> therefore they <b>came from</b> money <b>consecrated for Temple maintenance, or are they requirements of offerings, and</b> therefore <b>they were prepared from the collection of the</b> Temple treasury <b>chamber?</b> Rav <b>said to him: They are prepared only from the collection of the chamber.</b>

### Part 2
Rav Huna <b>raised an objection to</b> this from a verse that deals with those in charge of maintaining the Temple structure: <b>“And when they had made an end, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, of which were made vessels for the house of the Lord, vessels with which to minister,</b> and buckets, and pans, and vessels of gold and silver” (II Chronicles 24:14). This indicates that vessels may be prepared with money consecrated for Temple maintenance.

### Part 3
Rav <b>said to him: Whoever taught you the Writings did not teach you the Prophets,</b> as you forgot about the parallel verse in the Prophets: <b>“But there were not made for the house of the Lord cups</b> of silver, snuffers, basins, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into the house of the Lord; <b>for they gave that to those who did the work”</b> (II Kings 12:14–15). This verse proves that vessels were not prepared with the money donated for Temple maintenance.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, the verses contradict each other,</b> as in one place it states that the Temple vessels may be funded with the money donated for Temple maintenance, while in the other verse it states that this money was used exclusively for those involved in the actual work of Temple maintenance. The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult; here</b> it is speaking of a case <b>where they collected</b> funds <b>and there was</b> money <b>left over.</b> These funds could be used for Temple vessels. Conversely, <b>here,</b> the verse is referring to a situation <b>where they collected</b> funds <b>and there was nothing left over,</b> and therefore all of the money was allocated to actual Temple maintenance.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>And if they collected</b> money <b>and there was</b> some <b>left over, what of it?</b> After all, that money was consecrated for another purpose. If the Temple vessels could not be prepared with money consecrated for Temple maintenance, how were they able to use any of these funds for this purpose? <b>Rabbi Abbahu said: The court</b> initially <b>sets a mental stipulation about the</b> money collected: <b>If it is required</b> for Temple maintenance, <b>it is required</b> and is allocated accordingly, <b>and if not, it will be</b> used <b>for the service vessels.</b>

### Part 6
<b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> The funding for the <b>service vessels</b> of the Temple <b>comes from the collection of the</b> Temple treasury <b>chamber, as it is stated: “The rest of the money”</b> (II Chronicles 24:14). <b>Which money has a remainder? You must say</b> that <b>this</b> is referring to <b>the collection of the chamber.</b> After the money was brought into the chamber, a certain portion of it would be set aside for the requirements of the offerings, while the remainder was used for other purposes.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> one can <b>say</b> that <b>the remainder itself</b> was used for the Temple vessels, and the phrase “the rest of the money” does not refer to the funds of which there is a remainder, but to the remainder of the donations left in the chamber after the first collection was removed. The Gemara answers: This is <b>as Rava said</b> elsewhere, that the phrase <b>“the burnt-offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:5), with the definite article, is referring to <b>the first burnt-offering; so too,</b> the term <b>“the money”</b> (II Chronicles 24:14) is referring to <b>the first money,</b> i.e., the money removed from the collection of the chamber.

### Part 8
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the following source: The funds for <b>the incense and all communal offerings come from the collection of the</b> Temple treasury <b>chamber.</b> The funds for <b>the golden altar,</b> located inside the Sanctuary and upon which the incense was offered, <b>the frankincense, and the service vessels</b> all <b>come from the leftover</b> money of the funds set aside for <b>the libations.</b>

### Part 9
The funds for the upkeep of <b>the altar of burnt-offerings,</b> which was located outside the Sanctuary and on which most offerings were burned, and for <b>the chambers, and</b> for <b>the</b> various <b>courtyards, come from</b> money <b>consecrated for Temple maintenance.</b> Funds for those matters that are <b>outside the walls of</b> the Temple <b>courtyard come from the remainder of the chambers. And</b> with regard to <b>this we learned: The wall of the city, its towers, and all of the requirements of the city</b> of Jerusalem likewise <b>come from the remainder of the chamber.</b> According to this source, the funds for the sacred vessels came from the leftover money of the funds set aside for the libations, not the collection of the Temple treasury chamber.

### Part 10
The Gemara answers: <b>It is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 6a): <b>What would they do with the leftover</b> funds <b>of the collection</b> of shekels that had not been spent on communal offerings? They would purchase <b>golden plates</b> as a <b>coating for</b> the walls and floor of <b>the Holy of Holies. Rabbi Yishmael says:</b> There were different types of remainders in the Temple, each of which had separate regulations. <b>The leftover produce</b> was used to purchase the <b>repletion [<i>keitz</i>] of the altar,</b> i.e., burnt-offerings sacrificed when the altar would otherwise be idle. <b>The leftover</b> funds <b>of the collection</b> were used <b>to</b> purchase <b>service vessels.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Akiva says: The leftover</b> funds <b>of the collection</b> of shekels were used to purchase the animals <b>for the repletion of the altar,</b> as they had originally been collected for offerings. <b>The leftover libations</b> were used <b>to</b> purchase <b>service vessels. Rabbi Ḥanina, the deputy High Priest, says: The leftover libations</b> were used to purchase animals for <b>the repletion of the altar,</b> while <b>the leftover</b> funds <b>of the collection</b> of shekels were used <b>to</b> purchase <b>service vessels.</b> Both <b>this</b> Sage, Rabbi Akiva, <b>and that</b> Sage, Rabbi Ḥanina, <b>did not agree</b> with Rabbi Yishmael’s opinion <b>with regard to</b> the leftover <b>produce.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>What is this produce? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What would they do with the leftover</b> funds <b>of the collection? They</b> would use it to <b>buy produce at a cheap</b> price <b>and</b> subsequently <b>sell</b> that produce <b>at an expensive</b> price, <b>and the profit</b> earned from this trade would be used <b>for the repletion of the altar. And</b> with regard to <b>this we learned: The leftover</b> funds <b>of produce</b> were used to purchase the animals <b>for the repletion of the altar.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>what</b> is the reason that both <b>this</b> Sage, Rabbi Akiva, <b>and that</b> Sage, Rabbi Ḥanina, <b>did not agree</b> with Rabbi Yishmael’s opinion <b>with regard to the</b> leftover <b>produce?</b> The Gemara answers: Rabbi Akiva is consistent with his opinion elsewhere, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 6a): <b>What would they do with the leftover remainder of the chamber? They</b> would <b>purchase wine, oil, and fine flour</b> and sell them to those who needed them for their private offerings. <b>And the profit</b> from these sales would go <b>to consecrated</b> property, i.e., to the Temple treasury. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva says: One may not generate profit by</b> selling <b>consecrated</b> property, <b>nor</b> may one profit <b>from</b> funds set aside <b>for the poor.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara explains the reason for Rabbi Akiva’s ruling: <b>What is the reason</b> that one may <b>not</b> use <b>consecrated</b> property to generate a profit? It is because <b>there is no poverty in a place of wealth,</b> i.e., the Temple must always be run in a lavish manner. Therefore, one may not use Temple funds to generate small profits in the manner of paupers. <b>What is the reason</b> that one may <b>not</b> use funds set aside <b>for the poor</b> to make a profit? It is because <b>perhaps one will encounter a poor person and there will be nothing to give him,</b> as all of the money is invested in some business transaction.

### Part 15
§ The Gemara returns to the mishna, which deals with the case of <b>one who went overseas</b> and his wife is demanding sustenance. <b>It was stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> debated the following issue. <b>Rav said:</b>
