### Part 1
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Yosef sat before Rav Hamnuna</b> in the study hall, <b>and Rav Hamnuna sat and said</b> the following <i>halakha</i>: <b>Just as sons inherit only from land, so too, daughters are sustained only from land.</b> When Rav Hamnuna taught this <i>halakha</i>, <b>everyone clamored [<i>avash</i>] against him,</b> i.e., all his listeners whispered their surprise to one another: Is it only one <b>who leaves</b> behind <b>land whose sons inherit</b> from <b>him,</b> whereas in the case of one <b>who does not leave land, his sons do not inherit</b> from <b>him?</b> Rav Hamnuna’s statement indicates that sons inherit only land and nothing else.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Yosef said to</b> Rav Hamnuna: <b>Perhaps the Master was speaking</b> of the <b>marriage document</b> ensuring the inheritance rights of a woman’s <b>male children,</b> i.e., her sons’ right to inherit the sum stipulated in her marriage contract in addition to their share of the father’s estate alongside any other brothers. Rav Hamnuna <b>said to him: The Master, who is a great man, knows what I said,</b> i.e., that was indeed my intention, while the others failed to understand me properly.

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef said: Rav</b> would <b>sustain</b> orphan girls <b>with wheat according to the <i>aliyya</i></b> if their fathers did not leave land for them. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the scholars: <b>Was</b> this sustenance that Rav provided in the form of <b>livelihood,</b> i.e., a dowry so that they could marry, <b>and what is</b> the meaning of the term <b><i>aliyya</i>?</b> It means: In keeping with <b>the status [<i>illuyya</i>] of the father, and</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel. As Shmuel said: With regard to</b> the daughters’ <b>livelihood,</b> i.e., their dowry, the court <b>assesses</b> the amount they receive from their father’s estate after his death <b>in accordance with</b> the temperament and social and financial status of <b>the father.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Or perhaps</b> it <b>was actual sustenance,</b> i.e., provisions so that they would have food, <b>and what is</b> the meaning of the term <b><i>aliyya</i>?</b> It indicates that this <i>halakha</i> is one <b>of the good statements said in the upper chamber [<i>aliyya</i>], as Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef said:</b> When the Sages sat <b>in the upper chamber</b> to rule on certain <i>halakhot</i>, which they could not do in the study hall at that time due to persecution by gentiles, <b>they instituted that daughters should be sustained from movable property</b> in addition to land.

### Part 5
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to this dilemma: <b>In the possession of Rabbi Banai, the brother of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, there was movable property</b> belonging <b>to orphans,</b> deposited with him by their father. The orphan daughters <b>came before Shmuel,</b> who <b>said to</b> Rabbi Banai: <b>Go</b> and <b>sustain</b> the daughters from the property.

### Part 6
<b>What, is it not</b> correct to say that this means he should provide them <b>with sustenance, and</b> this would indicate that Shmuel <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef,</b> that the Sages instituted an ordinance in the upper chamber that daughters are entitled to their sustenance even from movable property? The Gemara refutes this claim: <b>No, there it is</b> stated in reference <b>to</b> their <b>livelihood, and Shmuel</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as Shmuel said: With regard to livelihood,</b> i.e., the dowry granted to daughters from their father’s estate, the court <b>assesses</b> the amount they receive <b>in accordance with</b> the status of <b>the father.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara relates: <b>There was an incident</b> of this kind that came before the court <b>in Neharde’a, and the judges of Neharde’a ruled</b> that the daughters must be supported from the movable property that their father had left. Likewise, a case occurred <b>in Pumbedita, and Rav Ḥana bar Bizna collected</b> the sum from movable property. <b>Rav Naḥman said to</b> the judges: <b>Go reverse</b> your decisions, <b>and if not, I will collect your houses [<i>appadnaikhu</i>] from you</b> in order to compensate those you ruled against.

### Part 8
The Gemara further relates: <b>Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi thought</b> to issue a ruling requiring a man’s heirs <b>to sustain</b> his daughters <b>from</b> the man’s <b>movable property. Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi said to them:</b> This is <b>a matter</b> about <b>which Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish did not take action,</b> i.e., they did not issue a ruling to this effect; will <b>you take action in</b> this regard? If those great Sages were not sure enough of the <i>halakha</i> to issue a practical ruling, how can you do so?

### Part 9
The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Elazar thought</b> to issue a ruling requiring a man’s heirs <b>to sustain</b> his daughters <b>from</b> his <b>movable property. Rabbi Shimon ben Elyakim said before him: My teacher, I know about you that you are not acting</b> according to <b>the letter of the law,</b> but <b>rather</b> out of <b>pity</b> for these daughters, who have no other source of support. <b>However,</b> you should still not do this, <b>lest the students observe and</b> mistakenly <b>establish</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> accordingly <b>for</b> future <b>generations.</b>

### Part 10
<b>A certain</b> person <b>came before Rav Yosef</b> to inquire about this matter. Rav Yosef <b>said to</b> the sons of the deceased man: <b>Give</b> the daughter her sustenance <b>from the dates</b> that are laid out to dry <b>on the mats [<i>budya</i>].</b> These fruits are certainly movable property. <b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>If it was a creditor</b> who came to collect a debt, <b>would the Master give him</b> the right to collect it <b>in this</b> manner? Even a creditor, who may collect his claim by repossessing property that the debtor has sold, cannot take movable property from the possession of orphans. A daughter, who cannot collect her sustenance from property that her father sold, should certainly not have the right to collect her sustenance from movable property that belongs to the male orphans.

### Part 11
Rav Yosef <b>said to</b> Abaye: I did not mean actual dates lying on mats; rather, <b>I spoke</b> of ripe dates ready for plucking, <b>which are fit for mats.</b> Since they are still attached to the ground, they are not considered movable property.
