### Part 1
<b>We too will say: <i>Ailonit</i>,</b> a sexually underdeveloped woman, is a term meaning: Like a <b>ram [<i>dukhranit</i>], because</b> like a male sheep [<i>ayyil</i>] <b>she does not bear children.</b>

### Part 2
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>a female convert, or a captive woman, or a maidservant, who were ransomed</b> with regard to the captive, or <b>who converted</b> with regard to the convert, <b>or who were freed</b> with regard to the maidservant, when they were <b>less than three years and one day old, their marriage contract is two hundred</b> dinars, as their presumptive status is that of a virgin. Even if they were subject to intercourse when they were younger than that age, the hymen remains intact. <b>And they are</b> subject to <b>a claim</b> concerning their <b>virginity.</b>

### Part 3
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Huna said:</b> With regard to <b>a convert</b> who is <b>a minor, one immerses him</b> in a ritual bath <b>with the consent of the court.</b> As a minor lacks the capacity to make halakhic decisions, the court is authorized to make those decisions in his stead.

### Part 4
<b>What is</b> Rav Huna <b>coming to teach us?</b> Is he teaching <b>that it is a privilege for</b> the minor to convert, <b>and one may act in a person’s interests</b> even <b>in his absence? We</b> already <b>learned</b> that explicitly in a mishna (<i>Eiruvin</i> 81b): One <b>may act in a person’s interests in his absence, but one may not act against a person’s interests in his absence.</b>

### Part 5
Rav Huna’s statement was necessary <b>lest you say:</b> With regard to <b>a gentile, licentiousness is preferable for him,</b> so conversion is contrary to his interests, just <b>as we maintain that</b> with regard to <b>a slave, licentiousness is certainly preferable.</b> Just as a slave has no interest in assuming the restrictions that come with freedom, in that a freed Canaanite slave is a convert to Judaism, a gentile would have the same attitude toward conversion.

### Part 6
Therefore, Rav Huna <b>teaches us: That applies</b> only with regard to <b>an adult, who has experienced a taste of prohibition.</b> Therefore, presumably he prefers to remain a slave and indulge in licentiousness. <b>However,</b> with regard to a <b>minor,</b> who did not yet engage in those activities, <b>it is a privilege for him</b> to convert.

### Part 7
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that the mishna <b>supports</b> Rav Huna’s statement: With regard to <b>a female convert, or a captive woman, or a maidservant, who were ransomed</b> with regard to the captive, or <b>who converted</b> with regard to the convert, <b>or who were freed</b> with regard to the maidservant, when they were <b>less than three years and one day old; what, is it not</b> referring to a case where <b>they immersed</b> the minor converts and the maidservants <b>with the consent of the court?</b> Apparently, a conversion of that sort is valid.

### Part 8
The Gemara rejects that proof: <b>No, with what are we dealing here?</b> It is <b>with a convert whose</b> minor <b>sons and daughters converted with him, as they are content with whatever their father does</b> in their regard. However, that does not apply to a child who is converting on his own.

### Part 9
<b>Rav Yosef said:</b> In any case where minors convert, when <b>they reach majority they can protest</b> and annul their conversion. <b>Abaye raised an objection to his</b> opinion from the mishna: With regard to <b>a female convert, or a captive woman, or a maidservant who were ransomed,</b> or <b>who converted, or who were freed</b> when they were <b>less than three years and one day old, their marriage contract is two hundred</b> dinars. <b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that when <b>they reach majority they can protest</b> and annul their conversion, <b>do we give her</b> the payment of the <b>marriage contract that she</b> will <b>go and consume in her gentile</b> state?

### Part 10
The Gemara answers: She receives payment of her marriage contract <b>once she has reached majority</b> and does not protest, but not while still a minor. The Gemara asks: <b>When she reaches majority too,</b> is there not the same concern that <b>she will protest and abandon</b> Judaism? The Gemara answers: <b>Once she reached majority</b> for even <b>one moment and did not protest, she may no longer protest.</b> This mishna poses no difficulty to the opinion of Rav Yosef.

### Part 11
<b>Rava raised an objection</b> from a mishna (29a): <b>These</b> are the cases of <b>young women for whom there is a fine</b> paid to their fathers by one who rapes them: <b>One who engages in intercourse with a <i>mamzeret</i>; or with a Gibeonite woman [<i>netina</i>],</b> who are given [<i>netunim</i>] to the service of the people and the altar (see Joshua 9:27); <b>or with a Samaritan woman [<i>kutit</i>].</b> In addition, the same applies to one who engages in intercourse <b>with a female convert, or with a captive woman, or with a maidservant,</b> provided <b>that</b> the captives <b>were ransomed or that</b> the converts <b>converted, or that</b> the maidservants <b>were freed</b> when they were <b>less than three years and one day old,</b> as only in that case do they maintain the presumptive status of a virgin. In all of these cases, <b>there is a fine</b> paid <b>to their</b> fathers if they are raped. <b>And if you say</b> that <b>when they reach majority they can protest</b> and annul their conversion, <b>do we give her</b> payment of the <b>fine that she</b> will <b>go and consume in her gentile</b> state?

### Part 12
The Gemara answers: Her father receives payment of the fine <b>once she has reached majority</b> and does not protest, but not while she is still a minor. The Gemara asks: <b>When she reaches majority too,</b> is there not the same concern that <b>she will protest and abandon</b> Judaism? The Gemara answers: <b>Once she reached majority</b> for even <b>one moment and did not protest, she may no longer protest.</b>

### Part 13
<b>Abaye did not state</b> his objection from the same source <b>as</b> did <b>Rava,</b> because <b>there,</b> in the mishna cited by Rava, it is referring to <b>a fine,</b> and in that case <b>this is the reason: So that the sinner will not profit.</b> The Sages did not absolve the rapist from payment of the fine merely due to the concern that the woman he raped may ultimately negate the conversion.

### Part 14
<b>Rava did not state</b> his objection from the same source <b>as</b> did <b>Abaye, as</b> with regard to <b>a marriage contract, this is the reason</b> that the Sages instituted it: <b>So that</b> his wife <b>will not be inconsequential in his eyes,</b> enabling him <b>to</b> easily <b>divorce her.</b> As long as this woman does not negate her conversion, she is a Jewish woman and the Sages saw to her interests.

### Part 15
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>an adult man who engaged in intercourse with a minor girl</b> less than three years old; <b>or a minor boy</b> less than nine years old <b>who engaged in intercourse with an adult woman; or a</b> woman who had her hymen <b>ruptured by wood</b> or any other foreign object, for all these women <b>their marriage contract is two hundred</b> dinars, as their legal status is that of a virgin. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: The marriage contract</b> of a woman whose hymen was <b>ruptured by wood is one hundred dinars,</b> as physically, since her hymen is not intact, she is no longer a virgin.

### Part 16
With regard to <b>a virgin</b> who is either a <b>widow,</b> a <b>divorcée, or a <i>ḥalutza</i></b> who achieved that status <b>from</b> a state of <b>marriage,</b> for all these women <b>their marriage contract is one hundred dinars,</b>
