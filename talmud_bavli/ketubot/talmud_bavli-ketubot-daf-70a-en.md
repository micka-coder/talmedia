### Part 1
<b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says it is a mitzva to fulfill the instructions of the dead,</b> as the mishna states that the third party must fulfill the instructions of the deceased, although the daughter is likely to do as she pleases after the third party fulfills his part. In this manner, Ilfa successfully answered the man’s challenge.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> that <b>Mar Ukva said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>whether</b> he <b>says: Give</b> a shekel <b>or whether</b> he <b>says: Do not give</b> more than a shekel, the court <b>gives</b> the sons enough for <b>all of their needs.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> how could we disregard the father’s words and give more, when the father said to give only a shekel? <b>We maintain</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says</b> that <b>it is a mitzva to fulfill the statements of the dead.</b> How, then, may the father’s instructions be ignored? The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> principle <b>applies</b> only <b>in other matters,</b> in which there is a mitzva to fulfill his wishes, <b>but in this</b> instance <b>it is</b> certainly <b>preferable to him</b> that his children be appropriately provided for. <b>And</b> the reason <b>that he said this</b> statement limiting the allowance is that <b>he came to encourage them</b> to adopt thrifty spending habits.

### Part 3
<b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Gittin</i> 59a): With regard to <b>children,</b> their <b>acquisitions</b> are considered <b>acquisitions and their sales</b> are considered <b>sales.</b> This is the case <b>with</b> respect to <b>movable properties,</b> but not with respect to real estate.

### Part 4
<b>Rafram said: They taught</b> this <b>only if there is no steward [<i>apotropos</i>]</b> overseeing the children’s affairs. <b>However, if there is a steward, the</b> children’s <b>acquisitions are not</b> considered <b>acquisitions and their sales are not</b> considered <b>sales,</b> even for movable property.

### Part 5
<b>From where</b> does he know this? <b>From</b> the fact <b>that it teaches</b> in the mishna here that even when there is a third party who functions as a steward, any <b>action of a minor girl is nothing.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And perhaps where there is a third party</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>is different?</b> It is possible that the act of a minor is discounted only when it clashes with the actions of an appointee who is past majority. The Gemara answers: <b>If so, let it teach: But with</b> regard to <b>a minor girl,</b> the <b>third party should execute</b> the agency <b>that was entrusted in his power. What</b> is the implication of the clause: Any <b>action of a minor girl is nothing? Conclude from this</b> that <b>even generally,</b> without a specific steward, a minor may not conduct transactions involving real estate.
