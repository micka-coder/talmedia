### Part 1
it is <b>as though she is at the beginning</b> of her period of widowhood, and she has another twenty-five years from that point during which she may demand payment of her marriage contract. <b>And if she has a marriage contract in her possession, she may collect</b> payment of <b>her marriage contract forever.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Naḥman, son of Rav Ḥisda, sent</b> the following message <b>to Rav Naḥman bar Ya’akov: Our teacher, instruct us.</b> Does the <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis apply in a case <b>where she has a marriage contract in her possession, or</b> does it apply only in a case <b>where she does not have a marriage contract in her possession? And in accordance with the statement of whom is the <i>halakha</i></b> decided?

### Part 3
Rav Naḥman bar Ya’akov <b>sent</b> back this answer <b>to him: When she does not have a marriage contract in her possession,</b> there is <b>a dispute,</b> but in a case <b>where she has a marriage contract in her possession,</b> all agree that <b>she may collect</b> payment of <b>her marriage contract forever.</b> And in a case where there is a dispute, the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the statement of the Rabbis.</b>

### Part 4
<b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he cited a dispute: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said in the name of bar Kappara: They taught</b> that a widow is presumed to have waived her rights to payment of her marriage contract after twenty-five years <b>only</b> with regard to <b>one hundred dinars</b> or <b>two hundred dinars,</b> which constitute the principal payment of the marriage contract. <b>However, she</b> still <b>has</b> the right to demand payment of <b>the additional</b> sum recorded in the marriage contract.

### Part 5
<b>And Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> said: <b>She does not have</b> the right to demand payment <b>even of the additional</b> sum recorded in the marriage contract, <b>as Rabbi Aivu said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yannai said: The stipulation</b> of an additional sum <b>in the marriage contract is like</b> the principal sum of <b>the marriage contract.</b> Consequently, if she waived her rights to the principal sum of the marriage contract, she has waived her rights to the additional sum as well.

### Part 6
It <b>was also stated</b> that other <i>amora’im</i> debated this matter: <b>Rabbi Abba said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said: They taught</b> that she is considered as having waived her rights to payment of her marriage contract <b>only</b> with regard to the principal payment of <b>one hundred</b> or <b>two hundred dinars, but she</b> still <b>has</b> the right to demand payment of <b>the additional</b> sum recorded in the marriage contract.

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Abba said to Rav Huna:</b> Did <b>Rav</b> really <b>say so?</b> Rav Huna <b>said to</b> Rabbi Abba: <b>Did you say</b> that in order to <b>silence me,</b> because you disagree with this ruling? <b>Or did you say</b> that because you are so satisfied with this ruling that you would like to <b>give me</b> wine to <b>drink?</b> Rabbi Abba <b>said to him: I said</b> that in order to <b>silence</b> you. This indicates that Rabbi Abba disagrees with Rav and accepts the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan on this issue.

### Part 8
§ The Gemara relates that <b>the mother-in-law of Rav Ḥiyya Arikha,</b> so named because of his height, as the word <i>arikha</i> literally means long, <b>was</b> also <b>the wife of his brother, and she was a widow</b> who resided <b>in the house of her father, and</b> Rav Ḥiyya <b>sustained her</b> for <b>twenty-five years in the house of her father,</b> from his brother’s estate.

### Part 9
<b>At the end</b> of the twenty-five years, <b>she said to him: Give me</b> my <b>sustenance. He said to her: You do not have</b> the right to continue to demand <b>sustenance.</b> She said to him: In that case, <b>give me</b> the payment of my <b>marriage contract. He said to her:</b> After twenty-five years, <b>you have no</b> right to demand <b>sustenance and you have no</b> right to demand payment of your <b>marriage contract.</b>

### Part 10
<b>She summoned him for judgment before Rabba bar Sheila. He said to</b> Rav Ḥiyya Arikha: <b>Tell me, then, what was the essence of the case?</b> Rav Ḥiyya Arikha <b>said to him: I sustained her</b> for <b>twenty-five years in the house of her father,</b> and I swear <b>by the life of the Master,</b> i.e., by your life, <b>that I delivered</b> her sustenance <b>to her</b> regularly <b>on my</b> own <b>shoulders.</b>

### Part 11
Rabba bar Sheila <b>said to him: What is the reason</b> that <b>the Sages said</b> that <b>as long as</b> the widow <b>is in the house of her husband, she may always collect</b> payment of <b>her marriage contract?</b> It is <b>because we say</b> that <b>it is due to embarrassment that she did not demand</b> payment of her marriage contract, because she is in her husband’s house and his heirs are treating her well. <b>Here too,</b> in this case, <b>it is due to embarrassment that she did not demand</b> payment of her marriage contract, as you treated her with great respect despite the fact that she was living in her father’s house. Therefore, <b>go</b> and <b>give her</b> the payment of her marriage contract.

### Part 12
Rav Ḥiyya Arikha <b>did not heed</b> the ruling of Rabba bar Sheila and did not give her the payment of her marriage contract. Rabba bar Sheila <b>wrote an authorization for her to</b> seize <b>his property</b> in payment of the debt. Rav Ḥiyya Arikha <b>came before Rava,</b> and <b>he said to him: Let the Master see how</b> Rabba bar Sheila has <b>judged me.</b> Rava <b>said to him: He has judged you well.</b>

### Part 13
The woman <b>said to</b> Rava: <b>If so, he should go</b> and <b>return to me</b> the <b>produce</b> that has grown on the property that I have a right to receive as payment, <b>from that day</b> that I received authorization to seize his property <b>until today. He said to her: Show me your</b> document of <b>authorization. He saw that it was not written in it: And it is known to us that these properties are</b> from the estate <b>of the deceased. Rava said to her: The authorization is not written well.</b> Consequently, the property is not considered as though it were yours from the time that the authorization was written, and you do not have a right to the produce.

### Part 14
<b>She said to him: Let the authorization go,</b> i.e., even if I have no right to the produce that grew from the time the authorization was written, <b>I should</b> have the right to <b>take</b> the produce that grew <b>from the time when the days of announcement were completed,</b> after the court assessed the value of the property, <b>until now. He said to her: This applies</b> only in a case <b>where there was no error written into the authorization, but where there was an error written into the authorization, we have no</b> right to collect the debt <b>with it.</b> You therefore have no rights to any of the produce.

### Part 15
<b>She said to him: But wasn’t it</b> you, <b>Master, who said</b> that omission of the <b>guarantee</b> of the sale from the document <b>is a scribal error,</b> and it is considered as though the guarantee were written in the document? Here too, say that the omission of the above clause is regarded as a scribal error and is considered as though it were written in the authorization.

### Part 16
<b>Rava said to her: In this</b> case, <b>it cannot be said</b> that the clause was meant to be included in the document and <b>it</b> was left out due to a <b>scribal error, because in this</b> case <b>even Rabba bar Sheila erred</b> and thought that the clause should not be included. <b>Initially,</b> Rabba bar Sheila <b>thought</b> as follows: Since <b>these</b> properties that always belonged to Rav Ḥiyya Arikha <b>and those</b> properties that had belonged to his deceased brother <b>are</b> all <b>his,</b> i.e., Rav Ḥiyya Arikha’s, as he inherited his brother’s property, <b>what</b> difference does it make <b>to me</b> if she collects <b>from these</b> properties, and <b>what</b> difference does it make <b>to me</b> if she collects <b>from those</b> properties? Although only the property of her deceased husband is liened for the payment of her marriage contract, it should not really matter whether she collects from this property or from other property belonging to the heir.

### Part 17
Rava continues: <b>But that is not so. Sometimes</b> the widow <b>will go and improve</b> the property of the heir, thinking that she will receive her payment from it, <b>and</b> the property <b>of her</b> deceased <b>husband</b> will <b>depreciate</b> due to neglect on the part of the heir, who knows that it is this property that is liened to ensure payment of the widow’s marriage contract. <b>And</b> eventually, the heir will <b>say to her: Take your</b> property, i.e., the property that belonged to your husband, <b>and give me my</b> property. <b>And</b> people <b>will come to cast aspersion on the court</b> as not being concerned for the welfare of the woman, who will be left with the depreciated property. Consequently, the document of authorization to seize property must specify exactly which property belonged to the widow’s deceased husband, which she is entitled to collect. Since Rabba bar Sheila erred and did not write this specification, the document of authorization he wrote was useless.
