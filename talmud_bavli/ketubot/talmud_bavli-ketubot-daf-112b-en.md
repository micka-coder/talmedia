<b>would stand</b> and pass <b>from</b> a <b>sunny</b> spot <b>to</b> a <b>shady</b> one, <b>and from</b> a <b>shady</b> spot <b>to</b> a <b>sunny</b> one, so that they would always sit in comfort and never have cause to remark that they were uncomfortable in Eretz Yisrael. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Gamda would roll in the dust of</b> the land, <b>as it is stated: “For Your servants take pleasure in her stones, and love her dust”</b> (Psalms 102:15).

### Part 2
The Gemara continues to discuss the messianic age. <b>Rabbi Zeira said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba said:</b> In <b>the generation in which the son of David</b> will <b>come</b> there will be <b>indictments [<i>kateigorya</i>],</b> i.e., denouncements and incitements <b>against Torah scholars. When I said this before Shmuel he said:</b> The generation will undergo <b>refinement after refinement,</b> i.e., several stages of cleansing, <b>as it is stated: “And if there be a tenth in it, it shall again be eaten up”</b> (Isaiah 6:13). <b>Rav Yosef taught</b> about the messianic era: <b>Despoilers and despoilers of despoilers</b> will plunder Eretz Yisrael at that time.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi said</b> that <b>Rav said: In the future all barren trees in Eretz Yisrael will bear fruit, as it is stated: “For the tree bears its fruit, the fig tree and the vine yield their strength”</b> (Joel 2:22). This verse indicates that every tree, not just the fig and vine, will produce fruit.
