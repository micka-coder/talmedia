<b>without support, standing with a support,</b> i.e. an object against which one can lean, <b>is better than it.</b>

### Part 2
<b>And so too,</b> the brothers <b>said</b> to Rabba: <b>Yitzḥak, Shimon, and Oshaya</b> all <b>said the same statement:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda with regard to female mules. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> With regard to <b>a female mule in heat, one</b> may <b>not mate a horse or a donkey with her,</b> due to the prohibition against crossbreeding of livestock. <b>Rather,</b> one mates her with <b>one of her kind,</b> another mule.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said,</b> in explanation of this last statement of Rabba’s brothers: <b>Yitzḥak is</b> to be identified with <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa; Shimon is Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi. And some say</b> that he is <b>Reish Lakish,</b> i.e., Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish. <b>Oshaya is Rabbi Oshaya the Distinguished</b>.

### Part 4
§ <b>Rabbi Elazar said: The common, uneducated people</b> will <b>not</b> come <b>alive</b> in the future, <b>as it is stated: “The dead live not”</b> (Isaiah 26:14). In other words, those who were already considered dead in their lifetimes will not come back to life afterward either. <b>This</b> idea <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“The dead live not”;</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that this is referring <b>to everyone,</b> i.e., none of the dead will live again. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “The shades [<i>refa’im</i>] rise not”</b> (Isaiah 26:14). This teaches that <b>the verse is speaking of one who weakens [<i>merapeh</i>] himself from matters of Torah.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to</b> Rabbi Elazar: <b>Their master,</b> i.e. God, <b>is not pleased that you say this of</b> ordinary Jews. Rather, <b>that</b> verse <b>is written about one who weakens himself</b> and succumbs <b>to idol worship.</b> Those who commit this great sin do not merit to be resurrected in the future. Rabbi Elazar <b>said to him: I teach</b> it from <b>a different verse, as it is written: “For Your dew is as the dew of light, and the earth shall bring to life the shades”</b> (Isaiah 26:19). Rabbi Elazar explains: <b>Anyone who uses the light of Torah,</b> which is called the dew of light, <b>the light of Torah</b> will <b>revive him; and anyone who does not use the light of Torah, the light of Torah</b> will <b>not revive him.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Since</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>saw that</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>was grieved</b> over the distress of common, uneducated people, <b>he said to him: My teacher, I have found for them a remedy from the Torah</b> so that they will merit life in the World-to-Come, as it states: <b>“But You who cleave to the Lord your God, are alive every one of you this day”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:4). <b>But is it possible to cleave to the Divine Presence? Isn’t it written: For the Lord your God is a devouring fire”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:24)?

### Part 7
<b>Rather,</b> this verse teaches that <b>anyone who marries his daughter to a Torah scholar, and one who conducts business [<i>perakmatya</i>] on behalf of Torah scholars,</b> by investing their money, <b>and one who</b> utilizes his wealth <b>to benefit Torah scholars with his property</b> in some other way, <b>the verse ascribes him</b> credit <b>as though he is cleaving to the Divine Presence.</b>

### Part 8
<b>On a similar note, you say:</b> The verse states: <b>“To love the Lord your God,</b> to hearken to His voice, <b>and to cleave to Him”</b> (Deuteronomy 30:20). <b>But is it possible for a person to cleave to the Divine Presence? Rather, anyone who marries his daughter to a Torah scholar, and one who conducts business on behalf of Torah scholars, and one who</b> utilizes his wealth <b>to benefit Torah scholars with his property, the verse ascribes him</b> credit <b>as though he is cleaving to the Divine Presence.</b>

### Part 9
§ <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef said: In the future,</b> at the time of the resurrection of the dead, <b>the righteous will burst forth and arise in Jerusalem, as it is stated: “And may they blossom out of the city like the grass of the earth”</b> (Psalms 72:16), <b>and</b> the term <b>“city”</b> means <b>nothing other</b> than <b>Jerusalem, as it is stated: “For I will defend this city”</b> (II Kings 19:34).

### Part 10
<b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef said: In the future the righteous will stand</b> up from their graves <b>in their clothes.</b> This is derived by an <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the example of <b>wheat: Just as wheat, which is buried naked,</b> i.e., the seed alone is planted, and yet it <b>emerges</b> from the ground <b>with several layers of garb,</b> including straw and chaff, in the case of <b>the righteous, who are buried</b> fully <b>clothed, all the more so</b> do they come out of the ground properly dressed.

### Part 11
<b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef</b> further <b>said: In the future Eretz Yisrael will produce cakes [<i>geluskaot</i>] and</b> fine <b>wool clothing [<i>meilat</i>]</b> that will grow from the ground, <b>as it is stated: “Let abundant [<i>pissat</i>] grain [<i>bar</i>] be in the land”</b> (Psalms 72:16). The term <i>pissat</i> is interpreted in a similar manner to <i>ketonet passim</i>, Joseph’s valuable clothing of many colors, while <i>bar</i> can mean bread.

### Part 12
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> the following with regard to the verse <b>“Let abundant [<i>pissat</i>] grain be in the land upon the top of the mountains”</b> (Psalms 72:16). <b>They said: In the future, wheat will rise up, and grow</b> tall <b>like a palm tree, and ascend to the top of the mountains. And lest you say</b> that if wheat will grow this tall <b>its reaper</b> will suffer <b>discomfort, the</b> same <b>verse states: “May his fruit rustle like Lebanon.” The Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> will <b>bring a wind from His treasury and blow across, and</b> this will thereby <b>induce the flour</b> to fall from the stalks of wheat, <b>and a person will go out to the field and bring back a palmful [<i>pissat</i>]</b> of flour, <b>from which he will</b> provide <b>his livelihood and the livelihood of the members of his household.</b>

### Part 13
It is stated: <b>“With the kidney-fat of wheat”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:14). The Sages <b>said: In the future,</b> each and every kernel of <b>wheat will be as</b> big as <b>the two kidneys of the large ox. And do not be surprised</b> that this is possible, <b>as there was</b> an incident involving <b>a fox that nested inside a turnip, and they weighed</b> this turnip, <b>and they discovered</b> that even discounting the space dug out by the fox, <b>it</b> still weighed <b>sixty <i>litra</i>,</b> as measured <b>by the <i>litra</i> of Tzippori.</b>

### Part 14
Similarly, <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> There was <b>an incident</b> which occurred <b>in</b> the village of <b>Shiḥin,</b> in Eretz Yisrael, <b>involving one whose father had left him three branches of mustard, one of which broke. And they discovered on</b> this one branch alone <b>nine <i>kav</i> of mustard. And</b> with the <b>wood of its</b> large branches <b>they roofed a booth for artisans.</b> Similarly, <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Taḥlifa said: Father left us a cabbage stalk and we would go up and down on it with a ladder,</b> due to its great height.

### Part 15
§ It is stated: <b>“And from the blood of the grape you drank foaming wine”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:14). The Sages <b>said: The World-to-Come is not like this world.</b> In <b>this world there is suffering</b> involved <b>in picking</b> grapes <b>and</b> in <b>pressing</b> them. By contrast, in the <b>World-to-Come</b> one will <b>bring one grape in a wagon or on a boat and set it down in a corner of his house and supply from it enough</b> to fill <b>about</b> the amount of <b>a large jug [<i>pitus</i>], and with its wood one will kindle</b> a fire <b>under a cooked dish. And every grape you have will produce no less</b> than <b>thirty full jugs of wine,</b> each with the capacity of a <i>se’a</i>. <b>As it is stated: “And from the blood of the grape you drank foaming wine [<i>ḥamer</i>].” Do not read</b> this term as <b><i>ḥamer</i>; rather,</b> read it as <b><i>ḥomer</i>,</b> which is a measure equaling thirty <i>se’a</i>.

### Part 16
§ <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Binding his foal to the vine”</b> (Genesis 49:11), which is interpreted as a prophecy for the future? It means that <b>every grapevine you have in Eretz Yisrael requires a foal to</b> carry the load of its <b>harvest.</b> The verse continues: <b>“And his donkey’s colt to the choice vine [<i>soreka</i>].”</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Every barren [<i>serak</i>] tree you have in Eretz Yisrael will produce</b> sufficient fruit in the future <b>to load</b> upon <b>two donkeys. And lest you say</b> that these trees <b>do not contain wine, the</b> same <b>verse states: “He washes his garments in wine.” And lest you say</b> that the wine <b>is not red, the verse states: “And from the blood of the grape you drank foaming wine”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:14).

### Part 17
<b>And lest you say</b> that this wine <b>does not inebriate</b> those who drink it, <b>the verse states: “And his vesture [<i>suto</i>]</b> in the blood of grapes” (Genesis 49:11). This verse indicates that these wines will induce [<i>mesit</i>] a state of drunkenness. <b>And lest you say</b> that this wine <b>has no flavor, the verse states: “His eyes shall be red [<i>ḥakhlili</i>] with wine”</b> (Genesis 49:12). This unusual term is read homiletically as follows: <b>Each palate [<i>ḥeikh</i>] that tastes it says:</b> This is <b>for me, for me [<i>li li</i>]. And lest you say</b> that the wine <b>is good for the young but it is not good for the old, the verse states: “And his teeth white [<i>leven shinayim</i>] with milk”</b> (Genesis 49:12). <b>Do not read</b> this expression as <b><i>leven shinayim</i>; rather,</b> read it as <b><i>leven shanim</i>,</b> one of years, i.e., an elderly person.

### Part 18
The Gemara asks: <b>To what does the plain meaning of</b> the aforementioned <b>verse refer? When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said: The congregation of Israel said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe: Hint with Your eyes</b> a love <b>that is sweeter than wine, and show me Your teeth</b> through a smile <b>that is sweeter than milk.</b>

### Part 19
The Gemara comments: This interpretation <b>supports</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan. As Rabbi Yoḥanan said: One who whitens his teeth to his friend</b> by smiling at him <b>is better than one who gives him milk to drink, as it is stated: “And his teeth white [<i>leven shinayim</i>] with milk”</b> (Genesis 49:12). <b>Do not read</b> this expression as <b><i>leven shinayim</i>; rather,</b> read it as <b><i>libbun shinayim</i>,</b> the whitening of teeth. Likewise, the phrase: With milk, can be read as: Than milk.

### Part 20
§ The Gemara relates further stories concerning the great bounty of Eretz Yisrael. <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Adda was a school teacher of Reish Lakish.</b> On one occasion, Rav Ḥiyya bar Adda <b>was delayed for three days and did not come</b> to teach the children. <b>When he</b> finally <b>came,</b> Reish Lakish <b>said to him: Why were you delayed?</b>

### Part 21
Rav Ḥiyya bar Adda <b>said to him: Father left me one branch</b> of a grape vine, <b>and I harvested from it</b> on the <b>first day three hundred grape clusters,</b> and each <b>cluster</b> yielded a quantity of wine enough <b>to</b> fill <b>a jug.</b> On the <b>second day I harvested</b> another <b>three hundred grape clusters,</b> and every <b>two clusters</b> yielded enough wine <b>to</b> fill <b>a jug.</b> On <b>the third day I</b> once again <b>harvested three hundred grape clusters,</b> and every <b>three clusters</b> yielded enough <b>to</b> fill <b>a jug, and I declared ownerless more than half of it.</b> Reish Lakish <b>said to him: Had you not delayed</b> and thereby disrupted the Torah study of children, each grape cluster <b>would have produced more</b> wine. Due to your cancellation of Torah study, each cluster yielded progressively less.

### Part 22
§ <b>Rami bar Yeḥezkel happened</b> to come <b>to Benei Berak.</b> He <b>saw those goats that were grazing beneath a fig</b> tree, <b>and there was honey oozing from the figs and milk dripping from</b> the goats, <b>and</b> the two liquids <b>were mixing together. He said: This is</b> the meaning of the verse “A land <b>flowing with milk and honey”</b> (Exodus 3:8).

### Part 23
<b>Rabbi Ya’akov ben Dostai said: There are three <i>mil</i> from Lud to Ono. Once I rose early in the morning and I walked in ankle-deep honey</b> oozing <b>from fig trees. Reish Lakish said: I myself saw</b> a region called: The place <b>flowing with milk and honey by Tzippori, and it was</b> an area that covered <b>sixteen by sixteen <i>mil</i>,</b> 256 square <i>mil</i>. <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: I myself saw</b> the region <b>flowing with milk and honey of all Eretz Yisrael,</b>
