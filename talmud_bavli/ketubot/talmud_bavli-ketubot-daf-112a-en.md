<b>and it was</b> the same in area <b>as</b> that which stretches <b>from</b> the city of <b>Bei Mikhsei until the fortress of Tulbanki: Its length twenty-two parasangs and its width six parasangs,</b> 132 square parasangs, which is 2,112 square <i>mil</i>.

### Part 2
§ The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Ḥelbo, Rabbi Avira, and Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina happened</b> to come on one occasion <b>to a certain place.</b> The locals <b>brought before</b> these Sages <b>a peach [<i>afarseka</i>] that was</b> as large <b>as a stewpot [<i>ilpas</i>] of Kefar Hino.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And how big is a stewpot of Kefar Hino?</b> The Gemara answers: It has a capacity of <b>five <i>se’a</i>. They ate one-third</b> of it, <b>they declared ownerless one-third</b> of it, <b>and they placed before their animals one-third</b> of it.

### Part 3
<b>In</b> the following <b>year, Rabbi Elazar happened</b> to come <b>to that</b> same place, <b>and they brought</b> a peach <b>before him. He held it in his hand,</b> as the peach was small enough for him to grasp in one hand, <b>and he said,</b> in reference to the change in size of the fruit from the previous year: <b>“A fruitful land into a salt waste, from the wickedness of they who dwell there”</b> (Psalms 107:34), i.e., their sins caused the drastic change in the yield of the produce.

### Part 4
§ Once <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi happened</b> to come <b>to Gavla,</b> in the Golan, and <b>he saw those clusters</b> of vines <b>that were standing</b> as large <b>as calves. He said</b> to the locals: <b>Calves are</b> standing <b>between the grapevines</b> and you are not concerned that they will cause damage? <b>They said to him: They are clusters.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>said: O earth, O earth! Gather in your fruit. For whom do you produce your fruit? For these gentiles who stand over us in our sins?</b> It would be preferable if you did not produce such large fruit.

### Part 5
The following <b>year, Rabbi Ḥiyya happened</b> to come <b>to that</b> same place, and <b>he saw clusters that were standing</b> as large <b>as goats. He said: Goats are</b> standing <b>between the grapevines. They said to him: Go</b> away; <b>do not do to us what your colleague</b> has done. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi’s curse was already fulfilled, as the fruit had shrunk from the previous year.

### Part 6
§ <b>The Sages taught: In</b> years of <b>blessings of Eretz Yisrael,</b> an area of land measuring <b>one <i>beit se’a</i> produces five thousand <i>kor</i>.</b> By way of comparison, <b>when Zoan,</b> a fertile region in Egypt, <b>was settled, one <i>beit se’a</i></b> there <b>would produce</b> only <b>seventy <i>kor</i>. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir said: I saw in the valley of Beit She’an</b> that one <b><i>beit se’a</i> produced seventy <i>kor</i>,</b> which teaches that the soil of a good-quality and irrigated stretch of land outside the borders of Eretz Yisrael will naturally yield this quantity of produce.

### Part 7
<b>And you have no more outstanding</b> earth <b>among all the lands</b> other <b>than the land of Egypt, as it is stated: “Like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt”</b> (Genesis 13:10). <b>And you have no more outstanding</b> region <b>in all of the land of Egypt than Zoan.</b> The superior quality of Zoan is derived from the fact <b>that they would raise kings there, as it is written: “For his princes are at Zoan”</b> (Isaiah 30:4). <b>And you have no rockier</b> terrain <b>in all of Eretz Yisrael than Hebron, as</b> people <b>would bury</b> their <b>dead there,</b> e.g., the Patriarchs in the Cave of Machpelah, because the land was not arable.

### Part 8
<b>And even so, Hebron was more developed,</b> i.e., more fertile, <b>than Zoan</b> by <b>sevenfold, as it is written: “Now Hebron was built [<i>nivneta</i>] seven years before Zoan in Egypt”</b> (Numbers 13:22). <b>What</b> is the meaning of the term: <b><i>Nivneta</i>,</b> in this verse? <b>If we say</b> it means <b>literally</b> that Hebron <b>was built</b> before Zoan, <b>would a person build a house for his younger son before building</b> one <b>for his older son? As it is stated: “And the sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan”</b> (Genesis 10:6), which indicates that Egypt, Mizraim, was older than Canaan, in whose territory Hebron was located.

### Part 9
<b>Rather,</b> the meaning of the verse is that Hebron <b>was more developed</b> and more fertile <b>than Zoan</b> by <b>sevenfold,</b> which means that Hebron produced 490 <i>kor</i>, seven times more than the seventy <i>kor</i> of regular fertile land, as stated above. <b>And this applies only to the rocky</b> terrain of Eretz Yisrael, e.g., Hebron, <b>whereas</b> those parts of Eretz Yisrael that were <b>not rocky</b> produced even more, up to <b>five hundred</b> <i>kor</i>.

### Part 10
<b>And this applies</b> only <b>to</b> a year when Eretz Yisrael is <b>not blessed. However,</b> with regard to a year <b>when it was blessed, it is written: “And Isaac sowed in that land,</b> and found in the same year a hundredfold” (Genesis 26:12). Isaac’s field produced one hundred times the normal yield, which according to the above calculations is five thousand <i>kor</i>, as stated in the <i>baraita</i>.

### Part 11
§ <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei said: A <i>se’a</i></b> of wheat <b>in Judea would produce five <i>se’a</i>.</b> How so? It would yield <b>a <i>se’a</i> of flour; a <i>se’a</i> of fine flour; a <i>se’a</i> of bran</b> fiber, from the outer layer of the grain; <b>a <i>se’a</i> of coarse bran,</b> i.e., flour mixed with bran fiber; <b>and a <i>se’a</i> of cibarium [<i>kiburaya</i>],</b> inferior flour. <b>A certain Sadducee said to Rabbi Ḥanina: You are improving your land very well;</b> my <b>father left me one <i>beit se’a</i></b> of land in Eretz Yisrael <b>and from it</b> I am able to produce <b>oil, from it</b> I produce <b>wine, from it</b> I grow <b>produce, from it</b> I grow <b>legumes,</b> and with it I provide pasture from which <b>my sheep graze.</b>

### Part 12
<b>A certain Amorite</b> once <b>said to</b> a resident <b>of Eretz Yisrael: That palm tree which stands on the banks of the Jordan, how many</b> dates <b>are you able to pick from it? He said to him: Sixty <i>kor</i>.</b> The Amorite <b>said to him: You have not yet</b> fully <b>entered</b> Eretz Yisrael and yet <b>you have</b> already succeeded in <b>destroying it. We would pick off that</b> tree <b>120<i> kor</i>.</b> The resident <b>said to him: I too am speaking to you</b> about only <b>one side</b> of the tree, as I have not yet picked the fruit off the other side.

### Part 13
§ <b>Rav Ḥisda said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And give you a pleasant land, the goodliest [<i>tzvi</i>] heritage”</b> (Jeremiah 3:19)? <b>Why is Eretz Yisrael likened to a deer [<i>tzvi</i>]?</b> This comparison comes <b>to tell you</b> that <b>just as</b> with regard to <b>this deer, its skin cannot contain its meat</b> once it has been skinned, <b>so too, Eretz Yisrael cannot contain its fruit</b> once it has been picked, due to the great quantity of the produce. <b>Alternatively, just as this deer is swifter than all the</b> other <b>beasts, so too Eretz Yisrael is swifter to ripen its fruit than all</b> the other <b>countries.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> so, one can suggest the following comparison: <b>Just as this deer is swift and its meat is not fatty, so too, Eretz Yisrael is swift to ripen</b> its fruit <b>but its fruit is not fat</b> and juicy. The Gemara explains: For this reason <b>the verse states: “Flowing with milk and honey”</b> (Exodus 3:8), to say that its fruit is <b>fat</b> and juicier <b>than milk and sweeter than honey.</b>

### Part 15
§ The Gemara relates that <b>when Rabbi Elazar ascended to Eretz Yisrael he said: I have been spared one</b> curse. <b>When they ordained him</b> and awarded him the title of Rabbi, <b>he said: I have been spared two. When they appointed him to sit in the council</b> of Sages who dealt with the <b>intercalation of the calendar, he said: I have been spared three.</b>

### Part 16
<b>As it is stated: “And My hand shall be against the prophets that see vanity,</b> and that divine lies; they shall not be in the council of My people, neither shall they be written in the register of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and you shall know that I am the Lord God” (Ezekiel 13:9). <b>“They shall not be in the council of My people,” this</b> is referring to <b>the council</b> of the <b>intercalation of the calendar; “neither shall they be written in the register of the house of Israel,” this</b> is referring to <b>ordination; “neither shall they enter into the land of Israel,”</b> this is understood <b>as per its plain meaning.</b> Rabbi Elazar merited that these three curses were not fulfilled in him.

### Part 17
§ <b>When Rabbi Zeira ascended to Eretz Yisrael he could not find a ferry to cross</b> the Jordan River. <b>He took hold of a rope</b> that was strung across as a makeshift bridge <b>and crossed</b> the Jordan. <b>A certain Sadducee said to him: Hasty people who put your mouths before your ears,</b> when you said at the time of the giving of the Torah: “We will do” before “we will hear” (Exodus 24:7), <b>you remain hasty</b> to this day. Why couldn’t you wait a little longer to cross the river on a ferry? Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him:</b> This is <b>a place where Moses and Aaron did not merit</b> entering; <b>who is to say that I will merit</b> seeing this land? I hurried across before anything might occur to prevent my entrance into Eretz Yisrael.

### Part 18
§ <b>Rabbi Abba would kiss the rocks of Akko,</b> which was on the coast of Eretz Yisrael. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina would repair its stumbling blocks,</b> i.e., any potholes in the land, so that travelers would not fall and consequently speak ill of Eretz Yisrael. <b>Rabbi Ammi and Rabbi Asi</b>
