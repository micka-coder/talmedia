### Part 1
§ <b>It was stated: Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Shmuel said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar: The Sages instituted</b> the marriage contract <b>for Jewish women: For a virgin two hundred</b> dinars <b>and for a widow one hundred dinars.</b> And they <b>deemed</b> the groom <b>credible</b> in <b>that if</b> he <b>says</b> with regard to his virgin bride: <b>I encountered an unobstructed orifice</b> and she is not a virgin, <b>he is deemed credible,</b> causing her to lose her marriage contract. The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> and the Sages deemed him credible, <b>what did the Sages accomplish in their ordinance</b> that the marriage contract of a virgin is two hundred dinars, if his claim that she is not a virgin is effective?

### Part 2
<b>Rava said:</b> The ordinance is effective due to the <b>presumption</b> that <b>a person does not exert</b> himself to prepare a wedding <b>feast and</b> then <b>cause it to be lost.</b> Investing in the wedding preparations clearly indicates that the groom’s intention is to marry the bride and rejoice with her. If, nevertheless, he claims that she is not a virgin, apparently he is telling the truth.

### Part 3
§ A Sage <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Since</b> payment of the marriage contract <b>is a penalty</b> instituted by the <b>Sages, she may collect only from the</b> husband’s <b>land of the most inferior quality.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>A penalty? What penalty</b> is there in a marriage contract? <b>Rather,</b> emend the <i>baraita</i> and <b>say: Since it is a rabbinic ordinance</b> and not a Torah obligation, <b>she may collect only from the</b> husband’s <b>land of the most inferior quality. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: The marriage contract of a woman is</b> an obligation <b>by Torah</b> law.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel say that? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that it is written with regard to a seducer: <b>“He shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins”</b> (Exodus 22:16)? The Torah establishes that <b>this</b> fine <b>will be like the dowry of a virgin,</b> and that <b>the dowry of a virgin</b> will be <b>like this</b> fine, i.e., fifty silver <i>sela</i>, or two hundred dinars. <b>From here the Sages based</b> their determination <b>that a woman’s marriage contract is</b> an obligation <b>by Torah</b> law. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: The marriage contract of a woman is not</b> an obligation <b>by Torah law, but</b> is <b>by rabbinic law.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara resolves the contradiction between the statements of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel: <b>Reverse</b> the attribution of opinions in this <i>baraita</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>And what did you see that</b> led <b>you</b> to <b>reverse</b> the attribution of opinions <b>in the latter</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>Reverse</b> the attribution of opinions in <b>the former,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, and say that Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel is the one who holds that the marriage contract is a rabbinic ordinance.

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: The reason is <b>that we learned that</b> it is <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel who said</b> elsewhere <b>that the marriage contract of a woman is</b> an obligation <b>by Torah</b> law, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (110b) that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says</b> that if a man marries a woman in Cappadocia, where the currency is more valuable, and he divorces her in Eretz Yisrael, <b>he gives her</b> payment for the marriage contract <b>from the money of Cappadocia.</b> From the fact that he is obligated to pay the marriage contract in the currency of the place where he undertook the obligation, apparently the marriage contract of a woman is an obligation by Torah law.

### Part 7
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the <b>entire</b> latter <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, but</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is incomplete and it is teaching the following: From here, the Sages based</b> their determination <b>that a woman’s marriage contract</b> in the case of a virgin <b>is</b> an obligation <b>by Torah</b> law. However, the <b>marriage contract of a widow is not</b> an obligation <b>by Torah law but</b> is an ordinance <b>by rabbinic law, as Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: The marriage contract of a widow is not</b> an obligation <b>by Torah law but</b> is an ordinance <b>by rabbinic law.</b>

### Part 8
§ The Gemara relates: <b>A certain</b> man <b>who</b> had never been married <b>came before Rav Naḥman</b> and <b>said to him: I encountered an unobstructed orifice</b> when I consummated the marriage. Rav Naḥman <b>said in his</b> regard: <b>Flog him</b> with <b>palm branches [<i>kufrei</i>]; prostitutes [<i>mevarakhta</i>] are common</b> around <b>him.</b> As he was never previously married, how was he able to determine whether or not the orifice was unobstructed, if he did not gain experience with prostitutes?

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t Rav Naḥman he who said that he is deemed credible</b> when he claims that he encountered an unobstructed orifice? The Gemara answers: Yes, <b>he is deemed credible, and</b> nevertheless, <b>we flog him</b> with <b>palm branches. Rav Aḥai answered: Here,</b> in the case where he is flogged, it is <b>with regard to a bachelor,</b> who is not accorded credibility, because he lacks experience. <b>There,</b> in the case where he is accorded credibility, it is <b>with regard to</b> one who has been <b>married.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara relates a similar incident from an earlier era: <b>A certain</b> man <b>who came before Rabban Gamliel said to him: I encountered an unobstructed orifice.</b> Rabban Gamliel <b>said to him: Perhaps you diverted</b> your approach and therefore, you encountered no obstruction? <b>I will tell you a parable to which this is similar.</b> It is similar <b>to a man who was walking in the blackness of night and darkness</b> and he arrived at the entrance to the house; if <b>he diverts</b> the object preventing the door from opening, <b>he finds it open;</b> if <b>he does not divert</b> it, <b>he finds it locked.</b> Perhaps you too diverted your approach and entered from a different angle and that is why you did not encounter an obstruction.

### Part 11
<b>Some say this is what</b> Rabban Gamliel <b>said to him: Maybe you diverted</b> your approach <b>intentionally and you displaced the door and the bolt. I will tell you a parable to which this is similar.</b> It is similar <b>to a man who is walking in the blackness of night and darkness</b> and he arrives at his entrance. <b>If he diverts intentionally, he finds it open; if he does not divert intentionally, he finds it locked.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara relates: <b>A certain</b> man <b>who came before Rabban Gamliel bar Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him: My teacher, I engaged in intercourse and did not find blood.</b> The bride <b>said to him: My teacher, I was a virgin.</b> Rabban Gamliel bar Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to them: Bring me that cloth [<i>sudar</i>]</b> on which you consummated the marriage. <b>They brought him the cloth, and he soaked it in water and laundered it and found upon it several drops of blood</b> from the rupture of the hymen. Rabban Gamliel bar Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to</b> the groom: <b>Go take possession of your acquisition,</b> as she was a virgin and there is no need for concern.

### Part 13
<b>Huna Mar, son of Rava, from Parzakya, said to Rav Ashi: Let us do so as well</b> in similar cases and examine whether there is blood that is obscured by semen or another substance. Rav Ashi <b>said to him:</b>
