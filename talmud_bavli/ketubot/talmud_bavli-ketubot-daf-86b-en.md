### Part 1
the court <b>strikes him</b> an unlimited number of times, even <b>until his soul departs,</b> in order to force him to perform the mitzva. The payment of a debt is a positive mitzva, and one who refuses to pay a debt can be compelled to do so in this manner.

### Part 2
§ <b>Rami bar Ḥama inquired of Rav Ḥisda:</b> If a man said to his wife: <b>This is your bill of divorce but you are divorced with it only after thirty days,</b> and she took the bill of divorce <b>and went and placed it in the sides of the public domain,</b> i.e., in a place that was open to the public domain but not an actual part of it, and the bill of divorce was still there after thirty days, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is she divorced?

### Part 3
Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him: She is not divorced.</b> This <i>halakha</i> is learned <b>from</b> the opinion <b>of Rav and Shmuel, as</b> it is <b>Rav and Shmuel who both say</b> with regard to the mishna: Any of the creditors of a deceased person can seize items of his movable property <b>provided that they are arranged in piles and placed in the public domain,</b> as in that case the heirs of the deceased do not receive it as part of their inheritance. Similarly, the woman will not acquire the bill of divorce after thirty days if it is in that location. Rav Ḥisda adds: <b>And the sides of the public domain are considered like the public domain.</b>

### Part 4
Rami bar Ḥama responded: <b>On the contrary, she is divorced,</b> in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rav Naḥman, as Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said:</b> With regard to <b>one who says to his friend: Go</b> and <b>pull this cow</b> now <b>and it will be acquired by you only after thirty days, he has acquired</b> the cow. <b>And</b> this is true <b>even</b> if the cow <b>was standing</b> after those thirty days <b>in</b> an ownerless <b>meadow [<i>agam</i>].</b> Since the acquisition began properly at the start of the thirty-day period, it applies even after the thirty-day period. <b>What, is it not</b> the case that <b>this is</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a meadow and this is</b> also the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the sides of the public domain,</b> as the two places have a similar status? Rav Ḥisda rejects this argument: <b>No,</b> the case of <b>a meadow is discrete, and</b> the case of <b>the sides of the public domain is discrete,</b> as the latter is considered an actual part of the public domain, and an ownerless meadow is not.

### Part 5
<b>Some say</b> a different version of the dispute between Rami bar Ḥama and Rav Ḥisda, in which Rav Ḥisda <b>said to</b> Rami bar Ḥama: <b>She is divorced,</b> based on the ruling of <b>Rav Naḥman</b> pertaining to acquiring a cow, <b>and the sides of the public domain are considered like a meadow.</b> In this version, it was Rami bar Ḥama who replied: <b>On the contrary, she is not divorced,</b> as can be learned <b>from</b> the opinion of <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> pertaining to seizing objects in the public domain. <b>What, is it not</b> the case that <b>this is</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the public domain and this is</b> similarly the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the sides of the public domain?</b> Rav Ḥisda responded: <b>No, the public domain is discrete and the sides of the public domain are discrete.</b>

### Part 6
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If there is <b>one who establishes his wife</b> as a <b>storekeeper</b> in his store, <b>or</b> if <b>he appointed her</b> as a <b>steward</b> to handle his property and workers, <b>this</b> one, i.e., the husband, can <b>administer an oath to her,</b> having her state that she did not appropriate any of his possessions, <b>whenever he wants. Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> He can administer an oath <b>even with regard to</b> the products of <b>her spindle and for her dough,</b> which are matters related to the household, and not her function as a storekeeper.

### Part 7
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: When <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> says that a husband can administer an oath to her with regard to any item, is <b>he saying</b> that this is <b>by means of extension</b> of an oath,i.e., once he administers an oath to her in her capacity as his storekeeper he can extend the oath to cover other matters, <b>or,</b> is <b>he saying</b> that he can administer an oath to her <b><i>ab initio</i>?</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a solution from a <i>baraita</i>: The Rabbis <b>said to Rabbi Eliezer: A person does not reside in a basket with a snake.</b> A woman is not expected to live with a husband who constantly suspects her of stealing. The Gemara explains: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that Rabbi Eliezer is referring to an oath administered <b><i>ab initio</i>,</b> the Rabbis spoke <b>well. However, if you say</b> that the husband can administer an oath to only <b>by means of an extension</b> of an oath, <b>what difference does it make to her?</b> As she must take an oath with regard to matters that concern the store, it does not cause any greater difficulty for her to take an oath with regard to the household matters.

### Part 9
The Gemara refutes this argument, as it is possible <b>that she says to him: Since you are so exacting with me, I cannot live with you.</b> Even if there is no additional oath, the sentiment engendered by his demand is grounds for dissatisfaction, and there is no proof that Rabbi Eliezer holds that he can administer an oath to her <i>ab initio</i>.

### Part 10
The Gemara suggests another proof. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who did not exempt his wife</b> in the marriage contract <b>from a vow and from an oath, and he established her</b> as his <b>storekeeper or appointed her</b> as his <b>steward, he</b> can <b>administer an oath to her whenever he wants.</b> If he <b>did not establish her</b> as his <b>storekeeper or appoint her</b> as his <b>steward,</b> he <b>cannot administer an oath to her.</b>

### Part 11
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Although he did not establish her</b> as his <b>storekeeper or appoint her</b> as his <b>steward, he</b> can <b>administer an oath to her whenever he wants, as you have no wife who did not become a steward</b> for <b>one hour in her husband’s lifetime</b> at least <b>for her spindle and for her dough.</b> The Rabbis <b>said to him: A person does not reside in a basket with a snake.</b> One can <b>conclude from this</b> that according to Rabbi Eliezer a husband can administer an oath to his wife with regard to her conduct, even <b><i>ab initio</i>.</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>Conclude from it</b> that it is so.

### Part 12
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>one wrote to</b> his wife in the marriage contract: <b>I do not have</b> the right to administer <b>a vow or an oath upon you,</b> he <b>cannot administer an oath to her.However, he can administer an oath to her heirs, and to those who come on her authority,</b> either as her representatives or because they purchased her marriage contract.

### Part 13
If the husband wrote: <b>I do not have</b> the right to administer <b>a vow or an oath upon you, or upon your heirs, or upon those who come on your authority,</b> he <b>cannot administer an oath</b> to <b>her; not to her, nor her heirs, nor those who come on her authority. But</b> the husband’s <b>heirs can administer an oath to her, and to her heirs, and to those who come on her authority.</b>

### Part 14
If he wrote: <b>Neither I, nor my heirs, nor those who come on my authority have</b> the right to administer <b>a vow or an oath upon you, or upon your heirs, or upon those who come on your authority,</b> he <b>cannot administer an oath</b> to <b>her</b> or to them; <b>not he, nor his heirs, nor those who come on his authority</b> may administer an oath, <b>not to her, nor</b> to <b>her heirs, nor</b> to <b>those who come on her authority.</b>

### Part 15
If a woman who was exempted from an oath by her husband <b>went from her husband’s grave,</b> immediately after her husband’s death, <b>to her father’s house,</b> without handling her late husband’s property, <b>or</b> in a case <b>where she returned to her father-in-law’s house and did not become a steward</b> over the property at all throughout this period, then <b>the heirs cannot administer an oath to her</b> with regard to her actions in their father’s lifetime, as the husband exempted her from an oath to the heirs. <b>And if she became a steward, the heirs may administer an oath to her about the future,</b> i.e., anything she did with the property after the death of her husband, <b>but they cannot administer an oath to her with regard to what</b> took place <b>in the past,</b> during her husband’s lifetime.

### Part 16
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the purpose of an oath?</b> What oath can he administer to her that caused him add this condition to her marriage contract? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b>
