### Part 1
<b>Rabbi Shimon says: Whenever she claims</b> payment of <b>her marriage contract, the heirs administer an oath to her. And if she does not claim</b> payment of <b>her marriage contract, the heirs do not administer an oath to her.</b>

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rami bar Ḥama thought to say</b> that the oath of a woman who vitiates her marriage contract is <b>an oath</b> required <b>by Torah</b> law, which is the oath of one who makes a partial admission, <b>as</b> the husband <b>claims</b> that he paid her <b>two hundred and she concedes to him with regard to one hundred. This is a partial admission of the claim, and</b> the principle is that <b>whoever admits to part of a claim must take an oath</b> according to Torah law to receive the remaining amount.

### Part 3
<b>Rava said:</b> There are <b>two answers in the matter,</b> in refutation of your argument: <b>One</b> response is <b>that anyone who</b> is obligated to <b>take an oath</b> that is enumerated <b>in the Torah takes an oath and does not pay.</b> By Torah law, one takes an oath only to exempt himself from payment, <b>and</b> in this case <b>she takes an oath and takes</b> her money. <b>And furthermore,</b> there is a principle that <b>one does not take an oath with regard to a denial of a lien on land.</b> The oaths of the Torah apply only to moveable property, not land. This means that if a claim involves a lien on land of any form, the oath of a partial admission does not apply, and a marriage contract includes a lien on land.

### Part 4
<b>Rather, Rava said:</b> This oath is <b>by rabbinic</b> law. It was instituted because the one <b>who pays is precise</b> and recalls that he paid his debt, whereas the one <b>who was paid is not precise.</b> When the husband claims to have paid her, he remembers clearly what happened, <b>and</b> therefore <b>the Sages imposed</b> the obligation of <b>an oath upon her, so that she should be precise</b> and remember exactly what occurred.

### Part 5
§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: In a case where <b>a woman vitiates her marriage contract</b> by accepting partial payment <b>in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Do we say that <b>if it is</b> so <b>that he has paid her</b> the rest of the marriage contract, <b>he would have paid her in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses,</b> and since he has no such witnesses, this is proof that she never received the rest of the money, and she is exempt from an oath? <b>Or perhaps he</b> simply <b>happened to have</b> witnesses for part of the payment, and he gave her the rest without witnesses, and she must take an oath with regard to the remainder of the sum?

### Part 6
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from a mishna (<i>Shevuot</i> 44b): <b>Anyone who</b> is obligated to <b>take an oath</b> that is enumerated <b>in the Torah takes an oath and does not pay. And these take an oath and take</b> their payment: <b>The hired worker</b> who demands his wages from his employer; <b>and one who was robbed; and one who was injured,</b> who claims compensation from the one who caused him damage; <b>and</b> if <b>the one opposing him,</b> the other litigant in a case, was supposed to take an oath but he is <b>suspected with regard to oaths; and a storekeeper</b> who makes a claim <b>on</b> the basis of what is written in <b>his notebook [<i>pinkaso</i>]; and one who receives partial payment of his document not in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses.</b> Conclude from this last clause that if one received partial payment of a document <b>not in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses,</b> then <b>yes,</b> he is obligated to take an oath, but if he received the payment <b>in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses,</b> then <b>no,</b> he is not obligated to take an oath.

### Part 7
The Gemara refutes this argument: The mishna <b>is speaking</b> utilizing the style of: <b>It is not necessary: It is not necessary</b> to state that if part of the marriage contract was paid <b>in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses, she certainly requires an oath. However,</b> if a partial payment was made <b>not in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses,</b> one might <b>say</b> that her partial admission <b>should be like one who restores lost property.</b> Since there are no witnesses that the husband paid anything, when she concedes to part of the claim it is as though she has restored to him a lost item. <b>And she should</b> therefore <b>take</b> the rest of the money <b>without an oath,</b> in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> that one who returns lost property does not have to take an oath that he did not appropriate part of what he found for himself. The <i>tanna</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that even in this case an oath is required.

### Part 8
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: With regard to <b>a woman who vitiates her marriage contract</b> and details with precision every sum of money that she received, specifying not only large sums of money but also sums so small that they amounted to <b>less than the value of a <i>peruta</i>, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say</b> that <b>since she is precise to such an extent she</b> must be <b>telling the truth, or perhaps</b> she <b>is deceiving</b> us? This question <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 9
Another <b>dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: In the case of a woman who <b>reduces her marriage contract</b> by saying that its sum was less than the usual amount, or less than the figure specified in the document, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say</b> that <b>this is</b> like the case of <b>a woman who vitiates</b> her marriage contract, and the <i>halakha</i> is the same in both instances? <b>Or perhaps</b> there is a difference between the two cases because <b>a woman who vitiates</b> her marriage contract <b>admits to part of</b> the claim, whereas <b>this one does not admit to</b> part of the claim. Here, she claims that she has received nothing at all, but that she is owed less than what was initially thought.

### Part 10
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who reduces</b> her marriage contract <b>can collect</b> it <b>without an oath. How so?</b> If <b>her marriage contract was a thousand dinars, and</b> her husband <b>said to her: You have received your marriage contract, and she says: I have not received</b> my marriage contract, <b>but it is only one hundred dinars,</b> she <b>may collect</b> it <b>without an oath.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: If her claim is accepted, <b>with what does she</b> in fact <b>collect</b> payment? <b>With this</b> marriage contract <b>document? This document is merely</b> a shard of <b>earthenware,</b> as she herself admits that the document is not a valid document because it records a fictitious sum. <b>Rava, son of Rabba, said:</b> It is referring <b>to one who says: There was</b> an agreement of <b>trust between him and me</b> that although the marriage contract records a large sum, I will claim only part of it, but the document itself is genuine.

### Part 12
§ The mishna teaches that if <b>one witness testifies that</b> the marriage contract <b>was paid</b> she must take an oath. <b>Rami bar Ḥama thought to say</b> that this is <b>an oath</b> required <b>by Torah</b> law, <b>as it is written: “One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:15). From here it is inferred: <b>It is for any iniquity or for any sin that he may not rise up,</b> i.e., the testimony of one witness is not enough for these purposes, <b>but he may rise up for an oath. And the Master said:</b> In <b>any place,</b> i.e., situation, <b>where two</b> witnesses are able to <b>deem one liable</b> to pay <b>money,</b> the testimony of <b>one</b> witness <b>obligates him to take an oath.</b>

### Part 13
<b>Rava said:</b> There are <b>two answers in the matter,</b> in refutation of your argument: <b>One</b> response is <b>that anyone who</b> is obligated to <b>take an oath</b> that is enumerated <b>in the Torah takes an oath and does not pay.</b> By Torah law, one takes an oath only to exempt himself from payment, <b>and</b> in this case <b>she takes an oath and takes</b> her money. <b>And furthermore,</b> there is a principle that <b>one does not take an oath with regard to a denial of a lien on land.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Rather, Rava said:</b> That oath was instituted <b>by rabbinic</b> law, <b>in order to put the husband’s mind at ease.</b> Since a witness contradicts her claim, the Sages imposed an oath upon her so that the husband would be sure that he is not giving away his money for no reason.
