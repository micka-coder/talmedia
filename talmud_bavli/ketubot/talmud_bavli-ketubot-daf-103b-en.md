<b>and reconvene the</b> study sessions at the <b>yeshiva after thirty days</b> of mourning. <b>My son Shimon is a Sage. My son Gamliel</b> should be the <b><i>Nasi</i>. Ḥanina bar Ḥama will sit at the head</b> of the yeshiva.

### Part 2
The Gemara explains the requests of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: <b>Do not eulogize me in the</b> small <b>towns.</b> They <b>understood from</b> this statement <b>that he said this due to the trouble</b> that would be caused for many if he were eulogized in every town, since they would have to travel from the outlying villages to take part in the eulogies. However, <b>when they saw that they were eulogizing him in the cities and everyone came</b> despite the trouble, <b>they said: Conclude from here that he said this due to</b> considerations of <b>honor.</b> Had they eulogized him in the towns, the gatherings would have been small and unfitting for a man of his stature. He therefore requested that they arrange things in a way that large crowds would gather.

### Part 3
Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi further instructed: <b>Reconvene the</b> study sessions at the <b>yeshiva after thirty days</b> of mourning. This is <b>because I am not better than Moses, our teacher, as it is written: “And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days”</b> (Deuteronomy 34:8), which means that for <b>thirty days they eulogized</b> him <b>by day and night. From this</b> point <b>forward they eulogized</b> him <b>by day and they studied by night, or they eulogized</b> him <b>by night and studied by day, until they eulogized</b> him <b>for twelve months</b> of <b>the year.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara relates that <b>on the day of the funeral</b> of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>a Divine Voice emerged and said: Whoever was</b> present <b>at the funeral of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>is destined for life</b> in <b>the World-to-Come.</b> There was <b>a certain launderer</b> who <b>would come before</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>every day. On that</b> particular <b>day, he did not come</b> and was therefore not present at the funeral. <b>When he heard this,</b> that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi had died, he was so full of grief that <b>he ascended to the roof and fell to the ground and died. A Divine Voice emerged and said: That launderer too is destined for life</b> in <b>the World-to-Come.</b>

### Part 5
§ Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi said: <b>My son Shimon is a Sage;</b> my son Gamliel should be the <i>Nasi</i>. <b>What</b> was <b>he saying,</b> i.e., what did he mean by these remarks? The Gemara explains: <b>This is what he</b> was <b>saying: Although my son Shimon is a</b> greater <b>Sage, my son Gamliel</b> should be the <b><i>Nasi</i>.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Levi said: Need this be said?</b> After all, Gamliel was the firstborn. <b>Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>said:</b> It is <b>necessary for you and for your limp.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What did</b> Rabbi Shimon find <b>difficult</b> with Levi’s question that caused him to scoff? <b>Doesn’t the verse state: “But the kingdom he gave to Jehoram because he was the firstborn”</b> (II Chronicles 21:3)? This indicates that the firstborn is the one who inherits his father’s appointment, and so Levi legitimately asked why Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi had to leave specific instructions about this.

### Part 7
The Gemara explains: <b>He,</b> Jehoram, <b>filled the place of his fathers,</b> i.e., he was their equal in his personal attributes and leadership capabilities. However, <b>Rabban Gamliel did not fill the place of his fathers,</b> and for this reason Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi had to specifically command that he nevertheless be appointed as the <i>Nasi</i>.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> if that is so, <b>what is the reason</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>did this?</b> Why did he choose this son to be his successor if he was unfit for the position? The Gemara answers: <b>Although he did not fill the place of his fathers with regard to wisdom,</b> as he was not as great a Torah scholar as his father, <b>he did fill the place of his fathers with regard to fear of sin</b> and was therefore fit to be appointed as the <i>Nasi</i>.

### Part 9
§ Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi instructed: <b>Ḥanina bar Ḥama will sit at the head</b> of the yeshiva. The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Ḥanina did not accept</b> this appointment, <b>because Rabbi Afes was older than him</b> by <b>two and a half years</b> and he did not want to precede him in accepting this position. Consequently, <b>Rabbi Afes sat at the head</b> of the yeshiva, <b>and Rabbi Ḥanina sat outside,</b> as it was unbefitting for him to sit as a student before Rabbi Afes. <b>And Levi came and sat</b> and studied <b>with him</b> outside.

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Afes died, and Rabbi Ḥanina,</b> taking his place, <b>sat at the head</b> of the yeshiva. <b>And Levi did not have anyone to sit</b> and study <b>with, and</b> so <b>he came to Babylonia. And this is</b> the background to the incident in which <b>they said to Rav: A great man came to Neharde’a, and he limps, and he taught:</b> It <b>is permitted</b> for a woman who is wearing a <b><i>kelila</i>,</b> a tiara-like ornament, to go out into the public domain on Shabbat. Rav then <b>said: Conclude from this</b> that <b>Rabbi Afes died and Rabbi Ḥanina,</b> taking his place, <b>sat at the head</b> of the yeshiva, <b>and Levi did not have anyone to sit</b> and study <b>with, and</b> so <b>he came</b> to Babylonia.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: How did Rav know that it was Rabbi Afes who died? <b>Say</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina</b> was the one who <b>died,</b> and <b>Rabbi Afes sat as he had sat,</b> i.e., he continued to sit at the head of the yeshiva, <b>and Levi did not have anyone to sit with, and</b> so <b>he came</b> to Babylonia. The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that <b>Levi was subordinate to Rabbi Afes</b> and would have sat before him as a student had Rabbi Afes still been alive, and the only reason why he sat outside in the first place was in deference to Rabbi Ḥanina, who sat outside because he did not consider himself subordinate to Rabbi Afes.

### Part 12
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>since Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi had <b>said: Ḥanina bar Ḥama will sit at the head</b> of the yeshiva, <b>it is not possible that he will not</b> one day <b>rule</b> the yeshiva. Therefore, it must have been Rabbi Afes who died and Rabbi Ḥanina who took his place, <b>as it is written about the righteous: “You shall also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto you”</b> (Job 22:28).

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>But wasn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> there? Why didn’t Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi appoint him as head of the yeshiva? The Gemara answers: <b>He died</b> before Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi. The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya say: I saw the grave site of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and I shed tears over it?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Reverse</b> the names. It was Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi who said that he saw the grave site of Rabbi Ḥiyya.

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya say:</b> On <b>that day that Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>died, sanctity ceased?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Reverse</b> the names. It was Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi who made this statement about Rabbi Ḥiyya.

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>When Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>fell ill, Rabbi Ḥiyya entered</b> to be <b>with him and found him crying. He said to him: My teacher, for what</b> reason <b>are you crying? Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <br>If one <b>dies while laughing, it is a good sign for him; while crying, it is a bad sign for him.</b> <br>If one dies with <b>his face upward, it is a good sign for him;</b> with <b>his face downward, it is a bad sign for him.</b> <br>If one dies with <b>his face facing the people</b> standing around him, <b>it is a good sign for him;</b> with <b>his face facing the wall, it is a bad sign for him.</b> <br>If one’s <b>face</b> is <b>sallow, it is a bad sign for him;</b> if <b>his face</b> is <b>yellow or ruddy, it is a good sign for him.</b> <br>If one <b>dies on the Shabbat eve it is a good sign for him,</b> because he is heading straight into the Shabbat rest; if one dies <b>at the conclusion of Shabbat it is a bad sign for him.</b> <br>If one <b>dies on the eve of Yom Kippur, it is a bad sign for him,</b> as his sins have not yet been forgiven; if one dies at <b>the conclusion of Yom Kippur it is a good sign for him,</b> because he died after his sins have been forgiven. <br>If one <b>dies due to an intestinal disease, it is a good sign for him, because most of the righteous die due to intestinal disease.</b>

### Part 16
Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him: I am crying for the Torah and the mitzvot</b> that I will be unable to fulfill after I die. This indicates that Rabbi Ḥiyya was present at the time of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s death.

### Part 17
The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that one must <b>reverse</b> the names and that it was Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi who came to visit Rabbi Ḥiyya prior to his death. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>actually</b> we <b>do not</b> need to <b>reverse</b> the names in all of the above statements, but rather explain that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya was occupied with</b> the performance of <b>mitzvot and Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>thought: I will not hold him back</b> from his performance of mitzvot by appointing him head of the yeshiva.

### Part 18
<b>And this is</b> the background to an exchange that took place <b>when Rabbi Ḥanina and Rabbi Ḥiyya argued. Rabbi Ḥanina said to Rabbi Ḥiyya: You are arguing with me? If, Heaven forfend, the Torah would be forgotten from the Jewish people, I would restore it through my analyses,</b> i.e., using my abilities of analysis I would be able to rediscover all that had been lost.

### Part 19
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya said</b> to Rabbi Ḥanina: <b>I am working</b> to ensure <b>that the Torah will not be forgotten from the Jewish people. For I bring flax and I plant it, and I</b> then <b>weave nets</b> from the flax fibers. <b>I</b> then go out and <b>trap deer, and I feed</b> the <b>meat to orphans, and I form scrolls from the skins of the deer. And I go to a town that has no teachers of children in it and I write the five books</b> of the Torah <b>for five children. And I teach the six orders</b> of the Mishna <b>to six children. To each and every one</b> of these children <b>I say: Teach your order to your friends.</b> In this way all of the children will learn the whole of the Torah and the Mishna.

### Part 20
<b>And this is</b> what <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi referred to when he <b>said: How great are the actions of Ḥiyya. Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>said to</b> his father: <b>Even</b> greater <b>than your</b> works? <b>He said to him: Yes. Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: <b>Even</b> greater <b>than</b> the work of Rabbi Yosei, my <b>father?</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him: Heaven forfend. Such</b> comments <b>should not be</b> made <b>among the Jewish people.</b>

### Part 21
§ The Gemara returns to the narrative of the impending death of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: <b>He said to them: I need my younger son. Rabbi Shimon entered his</b> presence. <b>He transmitted to him the orders of wisdom,</b> including how he should conduct himself and the essential principles of the Torah.

### Part 22
<b>He said to them: I need my older son. Rabban Gamliel entered his</b> presence, <b>and</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>transmitted to him the procedures</b> of the office <b>of the <i>Nasi</i>.</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to</b> Rabban Gamliel: <b>My son, conduct your</b> term as <b><i>Nasi</i> with assertiveness</b> and <b>cast fear upon</b> your <b>students,</b> i.e., treat them in a firm manner so that they will fear you.

### Part 23
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so</b> that it is correct to behave in such a manner? <b>But isn’t it written: “But he honors those that fear the Lord”</b> (Psalms 15:4), <b>and the Master said: This</b> is referring to <b>Jehoshaphat, king of Judea. When he would see a Torah scholar he would rise from his throne and hug him and kiss him and call to him: My teacher, my teacher, my master, my master.</b> This demonstrates that it is appropriate even for a king to behave with affection toward Torah scholars.

### Part 24
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> display of affection should be applied <b>in private,</b> when only the teacher and student are present, and <b>that</b> stern demeanor should be applied <b>in public,</b> in order to ensure the teacher’s authority.

### Part 25
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi was <b>lying</b> ill in <b>Tzippori and a</b> burial <b>site was ready for him in Beit She’arim.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Justice, justice shall you follow”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:20); <b>follow Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>to Beit She’arim,</b> i.e., one should seek to have his case adjudicated by Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s court in Beit She’arim. This indicates that Beit She’arim, not Tzippori, was Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s place of residence, and therefore he must have been lying ill in Beit She’arim.

### Part 26
The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>was in Beit She’arim, but when he became ill they transferred him to Tzippori,</b>
