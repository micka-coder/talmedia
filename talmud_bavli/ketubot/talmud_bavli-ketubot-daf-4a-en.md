### Part 1
<b>And</b> the groom then <b>engages in intercourse</b> with the bride to fulfill the <b>mitzva, and</b> then he <b>withdraws</b> from his wife, and the corpse is buried. <b>And</b> the groom then <b>observes the seven days of</b> the wedding <b>feast,</b> which are a personal festival for him, when the obligation of mourning rites does not take effect, <b>and thereafter he observes the seven days of mourning. And throughout those days</b> of rejoicing and mourning, the groom <b>sleeps among the men, and</b> the bride <b>sleeps among the women,</b> and they are not permitted to enter into seclusion. <b>And</b> in the event of mourning, <b>one does not withhold jewels from the bride</b> for the <b>entire thirty-day</b> period after the wedding, so that she not be undesirable to her husband.

### Part 2
<b>And</b> the wedding takes place and is followed by seven days of feasting and seven days of mourning, <b>specifically</b> if it is <b>the father of</b> the <b>groom or the mother of</b> the <b>bride</b> who died, <b>as</b> in that case <b>there is no</b> other <b>person who</b> would <b>exert</b> themselves <b>for them.</b> They are the ones responsible for the wedding preparations, and therefore the preparations that were completed must be utilized. <b>However,</b> if <b>the opposite</b> takes place, i.e., the mother of the groom or the father of the bride dies, <b>no,</b> the practice is different. The corpse is buried immediately, the seven-day mourning period is observed, and only afterward is the couple married.

### Part 3
<b>Rafram bar Pappa said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> that they are married immediately <b>only if one</b> already <b>placed water on the meat.</b> In that case, it will be impossible to sell it to others, and if it is not cooked immediately it will spoil and a significant loss will be incurred, potentially resulting in cancellation of the wedding feast. <b>However, if he did not place water on the meat, it</b> can be <b>sold.</b> No significant loss will be incurred, so the mourning period need not be postponed.

### Part 4
<b>Rava said: And in a city,</b> where there are typically many buyers, <b>even if he placed water on the meat it</b> can be <b>sold,</b> and the mourning period need not be postponed. <b>Rav Pappa said: And in a village, even if he did not place water on the meat, it cannot</b> be <b>sold,</b> because no buyers can be found to purchase a quantity of meat that great. Based on the statements of Rava and Rav Pappa, whether or not water was placed on the meat is irrelevant both in a large city and in a village. The Gemara asks: <b>Where do you find</b> a case where the statement <b>of Rav Ḥisda</b> applies? <b>Rav Ashi says:</b> It can be found in a place <b>like</b> his city of <b>Mata Meḥasya, which is removed from</b> the category of <b>a city,</b> as it is too small, <b>and removed from</b> the category of <b>a village,</b> as it is too large.

### Part 5
The following <i>baraita</i> was <b>taught in accordance</b> with the opinion of <b>Rav Ḥisda: If one’s bread was baked, and his animal slaughtered, and his wine diluted, and he placed water on the meat, and the father of the groom or the mother of the bride died, one moves the corpse into a room, and the bride and groom</b> are ushered <b>to the wedding canopy,</b> and they are married. The groom then <b>engages in intercourse</b> with the bride to fulfill the <b>mitzva,</b> and he then <b>withdraws</b> from his wife, and the corpse is buried. <b>And</b> the groom then <b>observes the seven days of</b> the wedding <b>feast, and thereafter observes the seven days of mourning. And throughout those days</b> of feast and mourning, the groom <b>sleeps among the men, and his wife sleeps among the women,</b> and they are not permitted to be alone together.

### Part 6
<b>And likewise,</b> a groom <b>whose wife began to menstruate</b> at the time of the wedding, <b>he sleeps among the men and she sleeps among the women,</b> until she becomes ritually pure. <b>However,</b> the Sages <b>do not withhold jewels from the bride</b> while she is in mourning for the <b>entire thirty-day</b> period after the wedding. <b>In any event, the</b> groom <b>may not engage in intercourse</b> with his virgin bride, <b>neither on Shabbat evening,</b> as he will thereby inflict a wound, <b>nor</b> at the <b>conclusion of Shabbat.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara proceeds to analyze the <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said: He sleeps among the men and she sleeps among the women.</b> This <b>supports</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan, as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Although they stated that there is no mourning</b> observed <b>on a Festival, yet one observes matters of privacy,</b> i.e., mourning practices not apparent to onlookers. Therefore, the groom and the bride may not engage in relations during the seven days of rejoicing, as the legal status of those days is like that of a Festival for them.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Yosef, son of Rava, taught in the name of Rava: They taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> that if the bride began menstruating, the bride and groom may not be alone together, <b>only if he did not engage in intercourse</b> with her. <b>However, if he engaged in intercourse</b> with her, and afterward she begins menstruating, <b>his wife sleeps with him,</b> and there is no concern that this will lead to their engaging in forbidden relations.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>But here,</b> with regard to mourning, <b>we are dealing</b> with a case <b>where he</b> already <b>engaged in intercourse</b> that was permitted prior to the funeral, <b>and</b> yet the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches: He sleeps among the men and she sleeps among the women.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>When he states</b> the ruling that if they already engaged in intercourse she sleeps with him, it was <b>concerning</b> only a case where <b>his wife began menstruating,</b> and it is not a case of mourning.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: But <b>doesn’t it state: And likewise,</b> indicating that the legal status of the mourner and the legal status of the groom whose wife is menstruating are the same?
