### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to a <b>woman to whom property was bequeathed before she was betrothed,</b> and she was then betrothed, <b>Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel agree that she may sell or give</b> the property as a gift, <b>and</b> the transaction <b>is valid.</b> However, if the property <b>was bequeathed to her after she was betrothed, Beit Shammai say: She may sell</b> it as long as she is betrothed, <b>and Beit Hillel say: She may not sell</b> it. Both <b>these,</b> Beit Shammai, <b>and those,</b> Beit Hillel, <b>agree that if she sold</b> it <b>or gave</b> it away as a gift, the transaction is <b>valid.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Yehuda said</b> that <b>the Sages said before Rabban Gamliel: Since he acquired the woman</b> herself through betrothal, will he <b>not acquire the property</b> from the moment of their betrothal? Why, then, is her transaction valid? Rabban Gamliel <b>said to them: With regard to the new</b> property that she inherited after marriage, <b>we are ashamed,</b> because it is unclear why she cannot sell it, as it is hers; <b>and you</b> also seek to <b>impose upon us</b> a prohibition with regard to <b>the old</b> property that she owned beforehand?

### Part 3
If the property <b>was bequeathed to her after she was married,</b> both <b>these,</b> Beit Shammai, <b>and those,</b> Beit Hillel, <b>agree that if she sold</b> the property <b>or gave</b> it away, <b>the husband may repossess</b> it <b>from the purchasers.</b> If she inherited the property <b>before she was married and</b> then <b>was married, Rabban Gamliel says: If she sold or gave</b> the property away, the transaction is <b>valid. Rabbi Ḥanina ben Akavya said</b> that the Sages <b>said before Rabban Gamliel: Since he acquired the woman</b> through marriage, will he <b>not acquire the property?</b> Rabban Gamliel <b>said to them: With regard to the new</b> property <b>we are ashamed, and you</b> also seek to <b>impose upon us</b> a prohibition with regard to <b>the old</b> property?

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Shimon distinguishes between</b> one type of <b>property and</b> another type of <b>property: Property that is known to the husband she may not sell</b> once she is married, <b>and if she sold</b> it <b>or gave</b> it away, the transaction is <b>void.</b> Property <b>that is unknown to the husband she may not sell, but if she sold</b> it <b>or gave</b> it away, the transaction is <b>valid.</b>

### Part 5
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> in the <b>first clause</b> of the mishna, when she inherited property before she was betrothed, such <b>that</b> Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel <b>do not disagree, and what is different</b> in <b>the latter clause,</b> when she inherited property after betrothal, such <b>that they disagree?</b> If the dispute concerns the right to her property after she is betrothed, what difference does it make whether her ownership began before or after the betrothal?

### Part 6
The Gemara answers that the Sages <b>of the school of Rabbi Yannai say: In the first clause,</b> where she inherited the property before her betrothal, the inheritance <b>was bequeathed</b> to her during a period when <b>she</b> had <b>rights</b> to her property, whereas <b>in the latter clause,</b> the inheritance <b>was bequeathed</b> to her during a period when <b>he</b> had <b>rights</b> to her property.

### Part 7
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If,</b> in the latter clause the property <b>was bequeathed</b> to her when <b>he</b> had <b>rights</b> to it, <b>why</b> is the transaction <b>valid when she sold</b> it <b>or gave</b> it away? <b>Rather,</b> in <b>the first clause,</b> where she inherited the property before her betrothal, it <b>certainly was bequeathed</b> to her when <b>she</b> had <b>rights</b> to it and it therefore fully belongs to her. However, in <b>the latter clause,</b> where she inherited it after her betrothal, one can <b>say</b> that perhaps during this time <b>she has rights</b> to it, or <b>say</b> that perhaps during this time <b>he has rights</b> to it. Since the ownership of the property is a matter of uncertainty, Beit Hillel rule that <b>she may not sell <i>ab initio</i>,</b> but <b>if she sold</b> it <b>or gave</b> it away, the transaction is <b>valid.</b>

### Part 8
§ The mishna states that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said</b> that the Sages <b>said before Rabban Gamliel:</b> Since he acquired the woman herself through betrothal, will he not acquire the property from the moment of their betrothal? <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: When <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> cited this question of the Sages, was he referring <b>to</b> her selling the property <b><i>ab initio</i>,</b> which is permitted only according to Beit Shammai, <b>or</b> was he referring <b>to</b> the sale <b>after the fact,</b> which is valid even according to Beit Hillel?
