### Part 1
<b>even if he is completely righteous but he took a bribe, he will not leave</b> this <b>world without becoming demented.</b>

### Part 2
<b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman bar Kohen interpreted</b> a verse <b>homiletically</b> as follows. <b>What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “The king by justice establishes the land, but he who exacts gifts [<i>terumot</i>] overthrows it”</b> (Proverbs 29:4)? <b>If a judge is like a king,</b> in <b>that he does not need anything</b> and is not dependent on anyone, <b>he establishes the land,</b> i.e., he can serve as a judge. <b>But if he is like a priest, who seeks out</b> his <i>terumot</i> <b>from</b> various <b>granaries,</b> as he is dependent on others, <b>he overthrows</b> the land.

### Part 3
§ <b>Rabba bar Rav Sheila said: This judge who borrows</b> items <b>from others is disqualified from rendering judgment</b> because it is as though he accepts a salary. <b>And we said this only</b> in a case <b>where he does not have</b> articles <b>to lend</b> out to others but is constantly borrowing without lending objects in turn. <b>However, if he has</b> items <b>to lend</b> out to others, <b>we have no</b> problem <b>with it.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But Rava</b> would <b>borrow</b> items <b>from the house of bar Maryon even though they would not borrow from him.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>There, he wanted to cause them to</b> be considered <b>more important</b> in the community. Rava was very wealthy and did not need to borrow for his own benefit. On the contrary, by borrowing from the house of bar Maryon he raised their standing in the community.

### Part 5
<b>Rava said: What is the reason for</b> the prohibition against taking <b>a bribe? Once</b> a judge <b>accepts a bribe from</b> one party, <b>his thoughts draw closer to him and he becomes like his</b> own <b>self, and a person does not find fault in himself.</b> The Gemara notes that the term itself alludes to this idea: <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b><i>shoḥad</i>,</b> bribe? It can be read as: <b><i>Shehu ḥad</i>,</b> as he is one, i.e., at one mind with the litigant. <b>Rav Pappa said: A person should not judge a case involving one whom he loves, nor involving one whom he hates.</b> He should not judge one <b>whom he loves,</b> as <b>he will not find any fault in him,</b> while with regard to one <b>whom he hates, he will not find any merit in him.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Abaye said:</b> With regard to <b>this Torah scholar who is beloved by the residents</b> of his town, <b>it is not because he is a superior</b> Sage than others; <b>rather,</b> it is <b>because he does not reprove them in Heavenly matters.</b> He is beloved because he is not strict with them with regard to the observance of mitzvot.

### Part 7
<b>Rava said: At first I would say</b> that <b>all these residents of Meḥoza love me;</b> however, <b>once I became a judge I said</b> that <b>some of them hate me and some of them love me,</b> as I assumed that their feelings toward me depended on the success of their case. <b>When I saw that the one I declared guilty today</b> would be <b>found innocent the following day,</b> I realized that my rulings do not determine their attitudes, and therefore <b>I said: If</b> they <b>love,</b> then <b>they all love me,</b> and <b>if</b> they <b>hate,</b> then <b>they all hate me,</b> regardless of what happens in the courtroom.

### Part 8
§ <b>The Sages taught: “And you shall take no bribe”</b> (Exodus 23:8). <b>It is not necessary to say</b> that this includes <b>bribery</b> by means of <b>money; however, even verbal bribery,</b> assisting by means of speech, <b>is also prohibited.</b> The <i>halakha</i> that a bribe is not necessarily monetary is derived <b>from</b> the fact <b>that it is not written: And you shall take no profit.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances of bribing with words?</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara explains: This can be demonstrated <b>by that</b> episode <b>involving Shmuel, who was</b> once <b>crossing</b> a river <b>on</b> a narrow <b>ferry. A certain man came</b> along <b>and gave him a hand</b> to help him out of the ferryboat. Shmuel <b>said to him: What are you doing</b> in this place? The man <b>said to him: I have a case</b> to present before you for judgment. Shmuel <b>said to him: I am disqualified from</b> presiding over <b>your case,</b> as you did me a favor. Although no money changed hands, a bond was formed between the pair.

### Part 10
The Gemara relates a similar story. <b>Ameimar was sitting and judging a case</b> when <b>a feather floated</b> and landed <b>on his head. A certain man came</b> by and <b>removed it</b> from his head. Ameimar <b>said to him: What are you doing</b> here? <b>He said to him: I have a case</b> to present before you. Ameimar <b>said to him: I am disqualified from</b> presiding over <b>your case,</b> due to the favor you performed for me. The Gemara likewise relates: <b>There was spittle lying before Mar Ukva. A certain man came</b> by and <b>covered it. He said to him: What are you doing</b> here? <b>He said to him: I have a case</b> to present before you. Mar Ukva <b>said to him: I am disqualified from</b> presiding over <b>your case.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara cites another incident. The <b>sharecropper of Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, was accustomed to bringing him a basket [<i>kanta</i>]</b> full <b>of fruits every Shabbat eve. One day, he brought him</b> the basket <b>on a Thursday.</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>said to him: What is different</b> that you came early <b>now,</b> this week? The sharecropper <b>said to him: I have a case</b> to present before you, <b>and I said</b> to myself that <b>along my way I will bring to the Master</b> the basket of fruits, as in any case I am coming on Thursday, the day the courts are in session. Rabbi Yishmael <b>did not accept</b> the basket of fruits <b>from him,</b> and he <b>said to him: I am disqualified from</b> presiding over <b>your case.</b>

### Part 12
Rabbi Yishmael <b>seated a pair of rabbinic</b> scholars <b>and they judged</b> the sharecropper’s case. <b>As</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>was coming and going, he said</b> to himself: <b>If he wants, he</b> could <b>claim this, and if he wants, he could claim that,</b> i.e., he kept thinking of all the ways in which the litigant who brought him the fruits could win his case. <b>He said</b> to himself: <b>Blast the souls of those who accept bribes. If I, who did not accept</b> anything, <b>and if I had accepted, I</b> would have <b>accepted my own</b> property, as it is my sharecropper and the fruits legally belong to me, am nevertheless in <b>this</b> state of mind due to the proposed gift, <b>all the more so</b> are <b>those who</b> actually <b>accept bribes</b> inevitably biased in favor of the one who bribed them.

### Part 13
The Gemara likewise relates with regard to <b>Rabbi Yishmael bar Elisha,</b> who was a priest, that <b>a certain man</b> once <b>brought him the first shearing.</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>said to him: From where are you?</b> The man <b>said to him:</b> I am <b>from such and such a place.</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>said to him: And from there to here was there no priest to</b> whom you could <b>give</b> the first shearing? <b>He said to him: I have a case</b> to present before you, <b>and I said</b> to myself that <b>along my way I will bring to the Master</b> the first shearing. Rabbi Yishmael <b>said to him: I am disqualified from</b> presiding over <b>your case,</b> and he would <b>not accept</b> the first shearing <b>from him.</b>

### Part 14
Rabbi Yishmael bar Elisha <b>seated a pair of rabbinic</b> scholars <b>and they judged his</b> case. <b>As</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>was coming and going, he said</b> to himself: <b>If he wants, he</b> could <b>claim this, and if he wants, he could claim that. He said</b> to himself: <b>Blast the souls of those who accept bribes. If I, who did not accept</b> anything, <b>and if I had accepted, I</b> would have <b>accepted my own</b> property, as I am a priest and am entitled to receive the first shearing, am nevertheless in <b>this</b> state of mind, <b>all the more so</b> are <b>those who accept bribes.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain man</b> who once <b>brought to Rav Anan a basket of small fish [<i>gildanei devei gilei</i>]. He said to him: What are you doing</b> here? The man <b>said to him: I have a case</b> to present before you. Rav Anan would <b>not accept</b> the basket <b>from him,</b> and <b>he said to him: I am disqualified from</b> presiding over <b>your case,</b> due to your actions.

### Part 16
<b>The man said to him: I do not need the Master’s judgment.</b> However, <b>let the Master accept my gift</b> anyway, <b>so that the Master does not prevent me from presenting first fruits.</b> What does the mitzva of first fruits have to with this situation? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And there came a man came from Ba’al Shalisha, and he brought the man of God bread of the first fruits, twenty loaves of barley and fresh ears of corn in his sack”</b> (II Kings 4:42). <b>But did Elisha,</b> the recipient of these gifts, <b>eat first fruits?</b> After all, he was not a priest. <b>Rather,</b> this verse comes <b>to tell you: Whoever brings a gift to a Torah scholar, it is as though he has presented first fruits.</b> This visitor to Rav Anan wished to fulfill this mitzva.

### Part 17
Rav Anan <b>said to him: I do not want to take it from you,</b> but <b>now that you have explained to me the reason</b> that you wish to give it to me <b>I will accept it</b> from you. Rav Anan <b>sent</b> the man <b>to Rav Naḥman,</b> and <b>he</b> also <b>sent him</b> a letter: <b>Let the Master judge this man’s</b> case <b>because I, Anan, am disqualified from judging his</b> cases. Rav Naḥman <b>said</b> to himself: <b>From the fact that he sent me this</b> letter, I can <b>conclude from here</b> that the reason he is disqualified from judging the case is because <b>he is his relative.</b> At that time, <b>a case involving orphans was</b> being heard <b>before</b> Rav Naḥman. <b>He said:</b>
