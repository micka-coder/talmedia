### Part 1
they did so <b>for</b> the <b>gain of the house,</b> as more food is available when he brings produce home, <b>but</b> in order for him <b>to sell</b> it they did <b>not</b> institute their decree? Two opinions were stated with regard to this issue: <b>Yehuda Mar bar Mareimar said in the name of Rava: What he did is done,</b> i.e., takes effect. <b>Rav Pappa said in the name of Rava: He did not do anything.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rav Pappa said: This</b> statement <b>of Yehuda Mar bar Mareimar was not stated explicitly</b> in Rava’s name. <b>Rather,</b> it <b>was stated from an inference</b> based on an incident that occurred in <b>which a certain woman brought in for</b> her <b>husband two maidservants</b> as part of her dowry. The <b>man went</b> and <b>married another woman</b> in addition to the first. <b>He</b> subsequently <b>brought in to</b> the second wife <b>one of</b> the maidservants to attend to her needs.

### Part 3
The first wife <b>came before Rava</b> and <b>cried</b> about the injustice done to her, but <b>Rava took no notice of her,</b> claiming she had no right to complain. <b>He who observed</b> this incident <b>thought</b> that Rava ruled this way <b>because he holds</b> that <b>what he did is done,</b> i.e., takes effect, and a husband may sell his wife’s usufruct property and use its produce as he sees fit. <b>But that is not so,</b> as the Sages instituted the ordinance that a husband owns the rights to the produce of his wife’s property <b>for the gain of the house, and</b> here <b>the house does gain</b> from his action, as the maidservant also performs work for the house.

### Part 4
The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>a husband who sold land for produce did not do anything.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the rationale</b> for this ruling? <b>Abaye said: We are concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the land itself <b>will deteriorate</b> over time, as the purchaser has acquired only its produce and has no incentive to take proper care of the land. <b>Rava said:</b> This is <b>because</b> there is no <b>gain of the house</b> here.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the</b> practical <b>difference between</b> these two explanations? The Gemara explains: <b>The practical difference between them</b> is, e.g., <b>land that is close to</b> the <b>town,</b> as one can check at any time whether the land is being cared for properly. <b>Alternatively,</b> the difference involves <b>a husband</b> who <b>is a sharecropper</b> and works the land himself but sold the rights of the produce to someone else. As a sharecropper, the husband retains part of the produce and will also ensure that the land does not deteriorate. <b>Alternatively,</b> the difference concerns a husband who receives <b>money</b> for the produce <b>and does business with it,</b> which provides gain for the house.

### Part 6
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> When a married man dies childless, his brother, the <i>yavam</i>, is obligated to perform levirate marriage or release the widow, the <i>yevama</i>, through a ceremony known as <i>ḥalitza</i>. With regard to <b>a widow waiting for her <i>yavam</i> who</b> had <b>property bequeathed to her, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel agree that she may sell or give</b> this property away, <b>and</b> the transaction is <b>valid.</b>

### Part 7
If this woman <b>died, what should they do with her marriage contract and with the property that comes and goes with her,</b> i.e., her usufruct property? <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> Since she was not yet remarried, <b>the husband’s heirs,</b> such as his brothers or father, <b>divide</b> the property <b>with</b> her <b>father’s heirs. And Beit Hillel say: The property</b> retains <b>its</b> previous ownership <b>status, and</b> therefore the <b>marriage contract</b> is <b>in the possession of the husband’s heirs,</b> as they are responsible for its payment. As for the <b>property that comes and goes with her,</b> it is <b>in the possession of the heirs of the</b> woman’s <b>father,</b> as it belongs to the woman.

### Part 8
If <b>his</b> deceased <b>brother left money</b> as part of his estate, <b>land</b> to be used as a lien on her marriage contract <b>is acquired with it, and</b> the <i>yavam</i> <b>consumes the produce.</b> Similarly, if the deceased brother left <b>produce that is detached from the ground, land is acquired with it and</b> the <i>yavam</i> <b>consumes the produce.</b>

### Part 9
If he left behind produce <b>that is attached to the ground, Rabbi Meir says: One evaluates</b> the properties to determine <b>how much they are worth with</b> the <b>produce, and how much they are worth without</b> the <b>produce. And</b> as for <b>the surplus,</b> which is the value of the produce, <b>land is acquired with it and</b> the <i>yavam</i> <b>consumes the produce.</b>

### Part 10
<b>And the Rabbis say: Produce that is attached to the ground</b> is <b>his.</b> Therefore, it is not used in the purchase of land, but the <i>yavam</i> may eat it. As for the produce <b>that is detached from the ground,</b> which is not mortgaged to her marriage contract, <b>whoever</b> takes possession <b>first has acquired it.</b> If the <i>yavam</i> takes possession of the property <b>first,</b> he <b>has acquired</b> it and may use it as he wishes, but if <b>she</b> is <b>first, land is acquired with it and he consumes the produce.</b>

### Part 11
After the <i>yavam</i> has <b>married her, her</b> legal status is <b>that of his wife in every sense, except that</b> the responsibility for payment of <b>her marriage contract</b> is carried out <b>through</b> mortgaging <b>the property of her first husband,</b> not that of the <i>yavam</i>.

### Part 12
Therefore, the <i>yavam</i> <b>may not say to her: Your marriage contract is placed on the table.</b> He may not set aside a designated sum of money for this payment. <b>Rather, all</b> of the first husband’s <b>property is mortgaged for her marriage contract</b> as long as he has not divorced her. <b>And similarly,</b> in general <b>a man may not say to his wife: Your marriage contract is placed on the table. Rather, all his property is mortgaged for her marriage contract.</b>

### Part 13
If the <i>yavam</i> <b>divorced her</b> after performing levirate marriage, <b>she has only her marriage contract,</b> as she does not retain any rights to the rest of her first husband’s property. If he subsequently <b>remarried her, she is like all women, and she has nothing but her marriage contract.</b> In this case, the property of her first husband is no longer pledged for the payment of her marriage contract.

### Part 14
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: In the case of <b>a widow awaiting her <i>yavam</i> who dies, who buries her?</b> Who is obligated to bear the expenses of her burial? Must the <b>husband’s heirs bury her, as they inherit the marriage contract, or perhaps</b> her <b>father’s heirs</b> are obligated to <b>bury her, as they inherit</b> the <b>property that comes and goes with her? Rav Amram said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a solution. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a widow waiting for her <i>yavam</i> who dies,</b>
