### Part 1
<b>Or, is the <i>halakha</i> in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who ruled that one who is destructive in causing a wound on Shabbat is liable if he did so intentionally?

### Part 2
With regard to the <i>halakha</i> of engaging in intercourse with one’s virgin bride on Shabbat, <b>it was stated</b> that <b>in the school of Rav they say: Rav permitted</b> doing so <b>and Shmuel prohibited</b> doing so. <b>In Neharde’a,</b> where Shmuel lived, <b>they say: Rav prohibited</b> doing so <b>and Shmuel permitted</b> doing so. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: And your mnemonic</b> is: <b>These are lenient</b> with regard <b>to themselves, and those are lenient</b> with regard <b>to themselves.</b> Each attributes the lenient ruling to the local halakhic authority, whose ruling is binding in that locale.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rav permit</b> engaging in intercourse in those circumstances? <b>But didn’t Rav Shimi bar Ḥizkiyya say in the name of Rav:</b> In the case of <b>this</b> cloth <b>stopper of a barrel [<i>nazyata</i>],</b> it is <b>prohibited to</b> insert <b>it tightly</b> in the spout of the barrel <b>on a Festival,</b> because in the process liquid will be squeezed from the cloth, and squeezing liquids is prohibited on Shabbat and Festivals. Apparently, Rav prohibits even unintentional actions.

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: <b>In the case</b> of the barrel, <b>even Rabbi Shimon concedes, as</b> it is <b>Abaye and Rava who both say: Rabbi Shimon concedes in</b> the case of: <b>Cut off its head and will it not die,</b> i.e., a case that involves inevitable consequences like the decapitation of an animal, that the action is forbidden. Here, the liquid will inevitably be squeezed from the cloth.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi say</b> that <b>Rav said</b> with regard to unintentional acts: <b>The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, and Rav Ḥanan bar Ami said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon. And Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin taught</b> these rulings directly, <b>without</b> citing additional <b>men</b> who transmitted them. <b>Rav said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, and Shmuel said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b> How then did Rav permit intercourse with one’s virgin bride on Shabbat?

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually, Rav holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b> According <b>to that version that said</b> that <b>the blood is pooled, he is destructive vis-à-vis the opening.</b> According <b>to that version that said</b> that blood is flowing through blood vessels <b>attached</b> to the body, <b>he is destructive in</b> causing the <b>wound,</b> and Rabbi Yehuda concedes that it is permitted.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Ḥisda raised an objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Nidda</i> 64b). With regard to <b>a young girl whose time to see</b> the flow of menstrual blood <b>has not arrived,</b> as she has not yet reached puberty, <b>and she married, Beit Shammai say: One gives her four nights</b> during which she may engage in intercourse, as any blood is attributed to the ruptured hymen. <b>Beit Hillel say:</b> There is no limit. Rather, any blood she sees is attributed to the ruptured hymen <b>until the wound heals.</b>

### Part 8
If, however, <b>her time to see</b> the flow of menstrual blood <b>has arrived,</b> as she has reached the age of puberty, even if she has not yet menstruated, <b>and she married, Beit Shammai say: One gives her the first night,</b> during which the blood is attributed to the wound. Thereafter, the blood is presumed to be menstrual blood, and she is forbidden to her husband. <b>Beit Hillel say: One gives her</b> from Wednesday, the day designated for marriage of a virgin, <b>until the conclusion of Shabbat, four nights.</b> During that period, any blood is attributed to the wound, and she is permitted to her husband.
