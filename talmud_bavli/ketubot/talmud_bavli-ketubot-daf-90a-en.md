### Part 1
<b>if</b> the date of the <b>bill of divorce precedes</b> the date <b>of the marriage contract, she</b> collects payment for her <b>two marriage contracts.</b> She is entitled to the first marriage contract by virtue of the bill of divorce. She is entitled to the second one because she has shown that it was written for her when they remarried. If the date of the <b>marriage contract precedes</b> the date <b>of the bill of divorce, she collects</b> payment of <b>only one marriage contract.</b> This is because it is presumed <b>that one who divorces his wife and remarries her, remarries her with the intention</b> of using her <b>first marriage contract,</b> unless there is a reason to say otherwise.

### Part 2
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>a minor who was married</b> off <b>by his father,</b> the wifeâ€™s <b>marriage contract</b> that the minor wrote <b>is valid</b> even after the husband comes of age. He cannot excuse himself by saying that it was drafted when he was a minor, <b>as</b> it is <b>on this condition,</b> the terms of this marriage contract, that <b>he maintained her</b> as his wife upon his maturity. Similarly, in the case of <b>a convert whose wife converted with him,</b> the <b>marriage contract</b> that she had as a gentile <b>is valid, for on this condition he maintained her</b> as his wife.

### Part 3
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Huna said: They taught</b> that the wife of a minor or convert receives payment <b>only</b> with regard to the main sum of <b>one hundred dinars</b> or <b>two hundred</b> dinars. <b>However, she does not have</b> the right to receive the <b>additional</b> sum that he wrote in her marriage contract, because this document is not legally binding, as it was written by a minor. She receives the main sum only as a result of an ordinance instituted by the Sages. <b>And Rav Yehuda said: She has even</b> the <b>additional</b> sum.

### Part 4
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> against the opinion of Rav Yehuda from a <i>baraita</i>: If a minor who came of age or a gentile who converted then <b>introduced</b> an additional sum to the marriage contract, <b>she takes</b> the additional sum <b>that they introduced.</b> The Gemara infers: <b>Yes,</b> the woman receives <b>what they introduced.</b> However, if <b>they did not introduce</b> an additional sum, she does <b>not</b> collect, even if it was written in the original marriage contract.

### Part 5
The Gemara refutes this proof: <b>Say</b> that this means that she takes <b>even that which they introduced,</b> in addition to the entire amount of her original marriage contract. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>did not teach this,</b> and the continuation of the <i>baraita</i> states the opposite: If <b>they introduced</b> a new sum, <b>she takes</b> the additional sum <b>that which they introduced.</b> If <b>they did not introduce</b> a new sum, <b>a virgin collects two hundred</b> dinars <b>and a widow one hundred dinars.</b> She does not collect the additional sum listed in the marriage document. This provides <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the statement <b>of Rav Yehuda,</b> whose opinion is rejected.

### Part 6
The Gemara explains: <b>Rav Yehuda was misled by</b> the language of <b>the mishna</b> and reached an incorrect conclusion. <b>He thought</b> that the phrase: <b>Her marriage contract is valid, is referring to the entire matter,</b> the entire sum of the marriage contract. <b>But that is not so,</b> as it <b>is referring</b> only <b>to the main</b> sum of the marriage contract that was established by the Sages, and not to any additional sum.
