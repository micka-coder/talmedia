### Part 1
a document of <b>authorization to repossess</b> liened property of the seller from anyone who purchased property from him <b>from</b> the first of the month of <b>Iyyar and on.</b> Rav Yosef <b>said to him:</b> A purchaser <b>can say to you: Your</b> deed is from <b>the first of Nisan,</b> so that the field that you purchased is rightfully yours and it is the other man, whose deed was dated on the fifth of Nisan, who took it illegally. Therefore, you should take possession of that field rather than repossessing other property.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>what is his remedy?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Let</b> the deed holders <b>write</b> a document of <b>authorization to each other.</b> If the individual whose deed was written on the fifth of Nisan authorizes the other individual to repossess property on his behalf, then he will be able to repossess property sold after the end of Nisan, because regardless of when his deed was written and whose deed was written first, he now has the right to repossess liened property.

### Part 3
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In a case of <b>one who was married</b> to <b>two women and sold his field, and the</b> wife whom he married <b>first wrote to the purchaser: I do not have</b> any <b>legal</b> dealings <b>or involvement with you,</b> then <b>the second</b> wife, who did not relinquish her claim to repossess this property, <b>may appropriate</b> the field <b>from the purchaser</b> as payment of her marriage contract. This is because the property was liened for the payment of her marriage contract before it was sold to this purchaser. Then, <b>the first</b> wife can appropriate the field <b>from the second</b> as payment for her marriage contract, since her marriage contract predates that of the second wife. <b>The purchaser</b> can then appropriate the field <b>from the first</b> wife, due to the fact that she relinquished her rights vis-à-vis the purchaser. They <b>continue</b> to do so according to this <b>cycle [<i>ḥalila</i>] until they</b> agree on a <b>compromise between them. And so too,</b> with regard to <b>a creditor, and so too,</b> with regard to <b>a female creditor.</b>

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>And if</b> the first wife <b>wrote</b> this <b>to him, what of it? Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who says to another,</b> e.g., if a field is jointly owned and one partner says to the other: <b>I have no legal</b> dealings <b>or involvement with regard to this field, or: I have no connection to it, or: I have withdrawn from it, has said nothing,</b> as such declarations have no legal validity. The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> It is a case <b>where he acquired</b> it <b>from her possession</b> by performing an act of acquisition in order to validate her relinquishing the field, in which case her statement is legally valid.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>And if they acquired it from her, what of it? Let</b> the woman <b>say</b> afterward: <b>I</b> did it only to <b>please my husband,</b> as I saw that he wished to sell the field and I did not want to quarrel with him, but I did not mean it seriously. <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 55b): If one <b>purchased</b> property <b>from a man,</b> even if he later <b>went back and purchased</b> rights to that property <b>from the</b> man’s <b>wife, the transaction is nullified? Apparently,</b> the wife <b>can say: I</b> did it only to <b>please my husband</b> but did not mean it, and that claim is accepted.

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Zeira said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> This is <b>not difficult: This</b> mishna here <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, and that</b> mishna in tractate <i>Gittin</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b>

### Part 7
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In a case where a husband <b>wrote</b> a bill of sale <b>to one</b> purchaser, <b>but</b> his wife <b>did not sign</b> it <b>for him</b> because she did not agree to the sale, and later he sold a different property <b>to a second</b> purchaser, <b>and</b> this time his wife <b>signed</b> the bill of sale <b>for him,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>she has lost</b> the settlement promised to her in <b>her marriage contract</b> in the event that the husband is left without property from which she can collect; <b>this is the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> According to Rabbi Meir, not only is the wife unable to sue the second purchaser after she signed his deed, but she cannot sue the first buyer either since he can say to her: When I purchased the field, I left you a field from which you could have collected, and you brought this loss upon yourself.

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that <b>she can say: I</b> did it only to <b>please my husband</b> but did not mean to ratify the second sale either; <b>and you, what</b> claim <b>do you have against me?</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: Is it possible that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, the redactor of the Mishna, presented the <b>unattributed</b> mishna <b>here in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir and</b> presented the <b>unattributed</b> mishna <b>there in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda?</b> Such a dichotomy is unlikely.

### Part 10
<b>Rav Pappa</b> offered another answer to the question and <b>said:</b> The mishna here is referring <b>to a divorcée</b> who wrote a note to the purchaser relinquishing her rights to the field after her divorce, <b>and everyone agrees</b> that her statement is binding, as she cannot claim to have acted in order to please her husband.

### Part 11
<b>Rav Ashi said: It is all</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, and Rabbi Meir states</b> his opinion <b>there only in</b> a case where the husband sold property to <b>two</b> different <b>purchasers, as they</b> can <b>say to her: If it is</b> true <b>that you acted</b> only in order to <b>please</b> your husband, <b>you should have done so with regard to the first</b> purchaser and not just the second. <b>However,</b> in a case <b>where</b> there is only <b>one purchaser, even Rabbi Meir concedes</b> that she can claim to have acted only out of the desire to please her husband. <b>And the mishna</b> here is referring to a case <b>where</b> the husband previously <b>wrote</b> a bill of sale <b>to another</b> purchaser and the wife did not ratify the sale, and the second time he sold a property she did ratify the sale. Consequently, even Rabbi Meir concedes that the woman cannot claim that she acted only in order to please her husband.

### Part 12
§ <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Gittin</i> 48b): <b>One does not collect</b> a debt <b>from liened property</b> that has been sold to a third party <b>where there is unsold property</b> available, <b>even</b> if the unsold property <b>is</b> of <b>inferior quality. A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If <b>the unsold</b> property <b>became blighted</b> and is no longer of sufficient value to pay off the debt, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Would the creditor be allowed <b>to repossess liened</b> property that has been sold to a third party?

### Part 13
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a solution to this dilemma based upon the following <i>baraita</i>: In a case where a husband <b>wrote</b> a bill of sale <b>to one</b> purchaser, <b>but</b> his wife <b>did not sign</b> it <b>for him,</b> and later he sold a different property <b>to a second</b> purchaser <b>and</b> his wife <b>signed</b> the bill of sale <b>for him,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>she has lost</b> the settlement specified in <b>her marriage contract</b> in the event that the husband is left without property from which she can collect; <b>this is the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>

### Part 14
Now, <b>if it should enter your mind</b> that in a case where <b>the unsold</b> property <b>became blighted</b> the creditor would be able to <b>repossess liened</b> property, then even <b>though she lost</b> her ability to collect <b>her marriage contract from the second</b> purchaser, <b>she should at least</b> be able to <b>collect from the first</b> purchaser, because she never relinquished her right to the property he purchased. Although there was unsold property left at the time that the first purchase was made, that property is inaccessible to her because she relinquished her right to it. Consequently, her inability to repossess property from the first purchaser indicates that it is not possible to repossess liened property in the event that unsold property is blighted.

### Part 15
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> It is possible to explain that <b>what</b> Rabbi Meir meant when he said: <b>She has lost</b> her marriage contract, is that <b>she has lost</b> her rights <b>from the second</b> purchaser alone, but not from the first.

### Part 16
<b>Rava said:</b> There are <b>two responses</b> with which your <b>statement</b> can be rejected. <b>One</b> is that the expression: <b>She has lost, indicates</b> that she has lost her rights <b>entirely,</b> even with regard to the first purchaser. <b>And furthermore, it is</b> explicitly <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If an individual <b>borrowed from one</b> creditor <b>and sold his property to two</b> purchasers <b>and the creditor wrote</b> a note <b>to the second</b> purchaser saying: <b>I do not have</b> any <b>legal</b> dealings <b>or involvement with you, he has no</b> claims <b>toward the first purchaser</b> either. This is <b>because</b> the first purchaser is <b>able to say</b> to the creditor: <b>I left you a place from</b> where <b>to collect</b> your debt, since when I purchased the land, unsold property still remained in the debtor’s possession, and therefore you have no claims against me.

### Part 17
The Gemara rejects the attempt to solve the dilemma with regard to collecting from liened property when the unsold property was blighted: <b>There,</b> in the case of a woman or man who wrote to the second purchaser: I do not have any legal dealings or involvement with you, it is <b>he who causes a loss to himself by</b> his own direct <b>action</b> of signing away his rights. It cannot be proven what the <i>halakha</i> would be in the case of a blighted field, where the reason he cannot make use of the field is not due to his own action.

### Part 18
<b>Rav Yeimar said to Rav Ashi:</b>
