then <b>sometimes, where he was not</b> detained <b>unavoidably</b> but he fulfilled the condition willingly to effect the divorce, <b>and</b> the wife <b>thinks</b> that he was detained <b>unavoidably, she will sit deserted,</b> forever unable to remarry. <b>And</b> the concern <b>due to licentious women</b> is, <b>as, if you said: Let it not be a bill of divorce,</b> then <b>sometimes, when he was</b> detained <b>unavoidably and she thinks</b> that he was <b>not</b> detained <b>unavoidably,</b> she goes <b>and remarries. And</b> the result will be <b>that the bill of divorce is void, and her children</b> from the second marriage will be <b><i>mamzerim</i>,</b> products of an adulterous relationship.

### Part 2
The Gemara questions the following premise: By Torah law, a condition that is unfulfilled due to circumstances beyond one’s control is considered fulfilled, and it is merely by rabbinic ordinance that it is deemed unfulfilled: <b>And is there a matter where by Torah</b> law <b>it is not a bill of divorce, but due to virtuous women and due to licentious women we permit a married woman to others?</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> it is within the authority of the Sages to institute an ordinance freeing the woman from the marriage, as <b>anyone who betroths</b> a woman, <b>betroths</b> her contingent <b>upon the agreement of the Sages,</b> and in certain cases, such as those mentioned above, <b>the Sages invalidated his betrothal</b> retroactively.

### Part 4
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi:</b> That <b>works out well</b> if <b>he betrothed</b> her <b>with money,</b> as in that case, the courts could declare the money ownerless, and one cannot betroth a woman with money that is not his. However, if <b>he betrothed</b> her <b>with intercourse, what can be said?</b> Rav Ashi answered: <b>The Sages rendered his intercourse licentious intercourse.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Some say,</b> to the contrary, that <b>Rava said:</b> Just as with regard to postponement of a wedding due to circumstances beyond his control, the groom is not obligated to provide sustenance for his betrothed, <b>the same is true with regard to the matter of bills of divorce.</b> The Gemara concludes that <b>apparently Rava maintains: Unavoidable circumstances</b> have legal standing <b>with regard to bills of divorce.</b>

### Part 6
<b>The Gemara raises an objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 76b): With regard to one who said to his wife: <b>This is your bill of divorce if I do not return from now until</b> the conclusion of <b>twelve months, and he died within</b> those <b>twelve months,</b> the document <b>is not a bill of divorce.</b> The Gemara infers: If <b>he died,</b> that <b>is when it is not a bill of divorce,</b> since a divorce cannot take effect posthumously. However, in cases involving other circumstances beyond his control, e.g., if <b>he fell ill</b> and therefore did not return, <b>it is a bill of divorce</b> and it does take effect.

### Part 7
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually, I will say to you</b> that in the case where <b>one falls ill it is also not a bill of divorce,</b> and death is merely an example of circumstances beyond one’s control. <b>And</b> the fact that the mishna cited <b>that</b> example <b>itself teaches us that there is no bill of divorce posthumously.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: Does it come to teach that <b>there is no bill of divorce posthumously? Wasn’t it already taught in the first clause</b> of that mishna? The Gemara answers: <b>Perhaps</b> it was necessary for the first clause to mention specifically the case of death, <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of our Rabbis.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Come and hear</b> an additional proof from the latter clause of that mishna: If one said: This is your bill of divorce <b>from now if I have not returned from now until</b> the conclusion of <b>twelve months, and he died within</b> those <b>twelve months,</b> then <b>this</b> document <b>is a bill of divorce. What, is it not that the same is true</b> if his failure to return is due to the fact that <b>he fell ill?</b> The Gemara rejects that proof. The divorce takes effect <b>specifically</b> in the case where <b>he died,</b> and he wrote the bill of divorce because <b>he was not amenable</b> to have his wife <b>happen before</b> her <b><i>yavam</i>,</b> his brother, for levirate marriage if he had no children. However, in cases where that is not a consideration, if other circumstances beyond his control caused the condition to be fulfilled, his intention is that the bill of divorce will not take effect.

### Part 10
<b>Come and hear</b> an additional proof <b>from</b> the case of <b>a certain</b> man <b>who said to</b> the agents with whom he entrusted the bill of divorce: <b>If I do not return from now until thirty days</b> have passed, <b>let this be a bill of divorce. He came at the end of thirty days,</b> before the deadline passed, <b>but was prevented</b> from crossing the river <b>by the ferry</b> that was located on the other side of the river, so he did not come within the designated time. <b>He said to the</b> people across the river: <b>See that I have come, see that I have come. Shmuel said:</b> It <b>is not considered</b> to be <b>a return.</b> Apparently, even if the condition was fulfilled due to circumstances beyond his control, the condition is considered fulfilled.

### Part 11
The Gemara rejects that proof: <b>Perhaps unavoidable circumstances that are common</b> and could be anticipated, e.g., the ferry being located at the other side of the river, <b>are different, since he should have stipulated</b> that exception when giving his wife the bill of divorce. <b>And</b> since he did not <b>stipulate</b> it, <b>he brought the failure upon himself.</b>

### Part 12
§ <b>Rav Shmuel bar Yitzḥak said:</b> The Sages <b>teach</b> that this <i>halakha</i> that a virgin is married on Wednesday is in effect <b>only from</b> the institution of <b>the ordinance of Ezra that courts are in regular session only on Monday and Thursday. However, prior to</b> the institution of <b>the ordinance of Ezra, when courts</b> were in <b>regular</b> session <b>every day, a woman was married on any day</b> of the week.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>Prior to</b> the institution of <b>the ordinance of Ezra? What was</b> in the past <b>was</b> in the past. There are no halakhic ramifications to that statement. The Gemara answers: <b>This is what</b> Rav Shmuel bar Yitzḥak <b>is saying: If there are courts</b> in <b>regular</b> daily session <b>today, as</b> they were <b>prior to</b> the institution of <b>the ordinance of Ezra, a woman is married on any day</b> of the week.

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>Don’t we require</b> the additional reason that a virgin is married on Wednesday because the Sages <b>were assiduous</b> in seeing to the well-being of Jewish women and made certain that the groom would have several days to prepare for the wedding feast prior to the wedding? The Gemara answers: This is referring to a case <b>where he</b> already <b>exerted himself</b> and prepared everything before Shabbat, so the feast will be prepared even if the wedding is Sunday or Monday.
