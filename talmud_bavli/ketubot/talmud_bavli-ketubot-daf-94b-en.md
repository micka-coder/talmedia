### Part 1
<b>And Shmuel said</b> his ruling <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, who said</b> that <b>witnesses of the transmission effect</b> the transaction, i.e., the act of transferring the legal document to the beneficiary causes the transaction to take effect. Therefore, the fact that the two documents bear the same date is of no consequence because the documents were presumably not given to their beneficiaries simultaneously, and the property belongs exclusively to the individual who received his document first. Consequently, there is no reason to divide the property.

### Part 2
The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> it is possible to say <b>that everyone</b> holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, and here they disagree about the following: Rav holds</b> that in a case of a doubt that cannot be resolved with regard to monetary law, <b>division is preferable, and Shmuel holds</b> that leaving the decision to <b>the discretion of the judges is preferable.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>Can you really establish</b> that the opinion <b>of Rav</b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar? Didn’t Rav Yehuda say</b> that <b>Rav said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar with regard to bills of divorce?</b> And Rav Yehuda related further: <b>When I said this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>in the presence of Shmuel, he said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Elazar <b>even with regard to</b> other legal <b>documents</b> as well. <b>By inference,</b> it is apparent <b>that Rav holds</b> that with regard to other legal <b>documents, no,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with Rabbi Elazar. <b>Rather, it is clear</b> that <b>Rav</b> holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, and Shmuel</b> holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>two deeds that are issued</b> dated <b>the same day,</b> the recipients of the deeds <b>divide</b> the property equally. Is this not <b>a conclusive refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>Shmuel</b> could have <b>said to you:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, and I said</b> my opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara continues to ask: <b>If</b> this <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, say the latter clause</b> of that same <i>baraita</i>: If <b>he wrote</b> a deed <b>to one</b> individual <b>and</b> then <b>transmitted it to another</b> individual, <b>the one to whom</b> the deed <b>was transmitted has acquired</b> the property. <b>If</b> the <i>baraita</i> is following the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, why</b> did the latter individual <b>acquire</b> the property? <b>Didn’t</b> Rabbi Meir <b>say</b> that <b>the signatory witnesses</b> on the document <b>effect the transaction</b> and not the witnesses to its transmission?

### Part 6
The Gemara responds: The <i>baraita</i> cited above is entirely in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Elazar. However, there <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i></b> with regard to money whose ownership is uncertain, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In a case where an individual sent a sum of money to another via a messenger, and by the time the messenger arrived, the intended recipient had died, and in the meantime, the individual who had sent the money also died, the <i>tanna’im</i> disagree about what to do with the money. <b>The Rabbis say:</b> The heirs of the sender and the heirs of the intended recipient <b>should divide</b> the money. <b>And here,</b> in Babylonia, <b>they said: The third</b> party, i.e., the messenger, <b>can do as he pleases</b> with the money, a ruling that is comparable to the solution of leaving the decision to the discretion of the judges.

### Part 7
The Gemara relates that <b>the mother of Rami bar Ḥama wrote</b> a deed <b>in the morning</b> transferring ownership of <b>her property to Rami bar Ḥama,</b> and <b>in the evening she wrote</b> another deed transferring <b>her property to</b> another of her sons, <b>Mar Ukva bar Ḥama.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rami bar Ḥama came before Rav Sheshet</b> and the latter <b>established his</b> right <b>to the property. Mar Ukva,</b> his brother, <b>came before Rav Naḥman</b> and the latter <b>established his</b> right <b>to the property. Rav Sheshet came before Rav Naḥman</b> and <b>said to him: What is the reason that the Master did this,</b> i.e., why did you issue this ruling? Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: And what is the reason that the Master did this,</b> i.e., why did you rule as you did?

### Part 9
Rav Sheshet <b>said to him: Because</b> Rami bar Ḥama’s deed <b>preceded</b> that of Mar Ukva. Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Rav Sheshet: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>we are sitting in Jerusalem, that we write the hours</b> on our legal documents? The <i>halakha</i> is that in any place where the hours are not recorded on legal documents, it does not matter when during the day a document was written. Rav Sheshet asked Rav Naḥman: <b>But what is the reason that the Master did this,</b> ruling as you did? Rav Naḥman <b>said to him:</b> It was <b>the discretion of the judges,</b> i.e., I ruled this way since it seemed to me that this is the way the mother wanted it.

### Part 10
Rav Sheshet <b>said to</b> Rav Naḥman: <b>I also</b> applied the principle of <b>the discretion of the judges</b> and ruled as I did. Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: One</b> response to your point is <b>that I am a judge, and the Master is not a judge,</b> as Rav Sheshet did not serve in the official capacity of a judge. <b>Furthermore, at the outset, you did not arrive at</b> your conclusion <b>for this</b> reason, but due to your own theory with regard to the dating of the documents, which proved to be incorrect.

### Part 11
The Gemara relates another incident in which an individual wrote two deeds about the same piece of property: There were <b>these two deeds that came before Rav Yosef.</b> In <b>one</b> deed, <b>it was written</b> that the owner of the field sold it to a particular individual <b>on the fifth of Nisan, and in</b> the other <b>one it was written</b> that he sold the same property to someone else <b>in Nisan, without specifying</b> on which day in Nisan the sale took place. <b>Rav Yosef established</b> that <b>the one</b> whose deed said <b>the fifth of Nisan</b> had the right <b>to the property.</b>

### Part 12
<b>The other</b> claimant <b>said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>Should I lose?</b> After all, it is possible that my deed was written prior to the other deed. Rav Yosef <b>said to him: You are at a disadvantage,</b> because there is no specific date in your deed, allowing one to <b>say</b> that <b>your deed is from the twenty-ninth of Nisan.</b> Since you have no way to prove otherwise, the property is awarded to the one who has a more specific date recorded in his deed.

### Part 13
The man <b>said to him: Let the Master write me</b>
