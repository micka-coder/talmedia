### Part 1
It is referring <b>to</b> a woman <b>who became a steward during her husband’s lifetime,</b> as it was common for a man to leave his wife in charge of his property while exempting her from taking an oath. <b>Rav Naḥman</b> said that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said:</b> It is referring <b>to a woman who claims that she received partial payment of her marriage contract,</b> who must take an oath that she received no more than the amount she admits to. The mishna is referring to a husband who exempted his wife from this oath.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Mordekhai went</b> and <b>said</b> this <b><i>halakha</i> before Rav Ashi</b> and asked him the following question: <b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> that <b>it is referring to a woman who claims that she received partial payment of her marriage contract,</b> it makes sense <b>that it enters her mind</b> that this might happen, as she thinks: <b>Perhaps I will require money, and I will take</b> what I need <b>from my marriage contract</b> up front. <b>And she</b> therefore <b>says to him</b> before their marriage: <b>Write for me that you will not administer an oath to me</b> when I come to collect the rest of my marriage contract. <b>However, according to the one who says</b> that it <b>is referring to</b> a woman <b>who became a steward during her husband’s lifetime, did she know</b> beforehand <b>that</b> her husband <b>would establish her as a steward,</b> to know <b>to say to him: Write for me that you will not administer an oath to me?</b>

### Part 3
Rav Ashi <b>said to him: You teach this</b> <i>halakha</i> of Rav Yehuda <b>with regard to that</b> part of the mishna, and therefore you find it difficult. <b>We,</b> however, <b>teach it with regard to this</b> part of the mishna: If <b>she went from her husband’s grave to her father’s house</b> without handling her late husband’s property, <b>or</b> in a case <b>where she returned to her father-in-law’s house and did not become a steward</b> over the property at all throughout this period, then <b>the heirs cannot administer an oath to her</b> with regard to her actions in their father’s lifetime, as the husband exempted her from an oath to the heirs. <b>And if she became a steward, the heirs may administer an oath to her about the future,</b> i.e., anything she did with the property after the death of her husband, <b>but they cannot administer an oath to her with regard to what</b> took place <b>in the past,</b> during her husband’s lifetime.

### Part 4
It was with regard to this statement that the Gemara asked: <b>What is the purpose of</b> mentioning <b>the past?</b> What oath would they have wanted her to take with regard to the past? And it was in response to this question that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> It is referring <b>to</b> a woman <b>who became a steward during her husband’s lifetime.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara presents a dispute as to what is considered the past, first continuing the quote from Rav Yehuda: <b>But they can administer an oath to her</b> with regard to her conduct <b>between</b> her husband’s <b>death and</b> his <b>burial. And Rav Mattana said: Even</b> concerning her actions <b>between</b> her husband’s <b>death and</b> his <b>burial, they cannot administer an oath to her, as</b> the Sages of <b>Neharde’a say: For</b> the purpose of paying <b>head tax [<i>karga</i>], and for</b> payment to provide for children’s <b>sustenance, and for burial, we sell</b> property inherited by orphans <b>without an announcement.</b> In these urgent matters, the court is not particular about a possible loss incurred by the heirs. Similarly, the a woman need not take an oath with regard to how she conducted her affairs for her husband’s funeral, because in such a time of stress she cannot manage her accounts in a precise manner.

### Part 6
§ <b>Rabba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya said:</b> If a husband wrote: <b>Not a vow and not an oath,</b> this means that <b>he cannot administer an oath to her, but</b> his <b>heirs can administer an oath to her.</b> If he wrote: She is <b>clear,</b> i.e., exempt, from <b>a vow</b> and <b>clear</b> from <b>an oath, neither he nor</b> his <b>heirs can administer an oath to her.</b> This is because in effect <b>this is what he is saying to her: You are clear</b> from <b>the oath,</b> no matter who seeks to administer it to you.

### Part 7
<b>But Rav Yosef</b> said that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya said</b> the opposite ruling with regard to the second clause: If he wrote: <b>Not a vow and not an oath, he cannot administer an oath to her, but</b> his <b>heirs can administer an oath to her.</b> If he wrote: She is <b>clear</b> from <b>a vow</b> and <b>clear</b> from <b>an oath, either he or</b> his <b>heirs can administer an oath to her.</b> This is because in effect <b>this is what he is saying to her: Clear yourself</b> from any suspicion <b>by</b> means of <b>an oath.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Zakkai sent</b> the following ruling <b>to Mar Ukva</b> from Eretz Yisrael: <b>Whether</b> he wrote: <b>Not an oath,</b> or <b>whether</b> he wrote: <b>Clear</b> from <b>an oath,</b> and <b>whether</b> he wrote: <b>Not a vow,</b> or <b>whether</b> he wrote: <b>Clear</b> from <b>a vow,</b> if he added the phrase: <b>With regard to my property, he cannot administer an oath to her, but</b> his <b>heirs can administer an oath to her.</b> However, if he added the phrase: <b>From these properties, neither he nor his heirs can administer an oath to her.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Shmuel said in the name of Abba Shaul ben Imma Miriam: Whether</b> he wrote: <b>Not an oath,</b> or <b>whether</b> he wrote: <b>Clear</b> from <b>an oath,</b> and <b>whether</b> he wrote: <b>Not a vow,</b> or <b>whether</b> he wrote: <b>Clear</b> from <b>a vow,</b> and <b>whether</b> he added: <b>From my property,</b> or <b>whether</b> he added: <b>From these properties, neither he nor his heirs can administer an oath to her</b> according to the letter of the law. <b>However, what can I do, as the Sages said</b> that <b>one who comes to collect</b> a debt <b>from the property of orphans may collect</b> it <b>only by</b> means of <b>an oath?</b> Therefore, she is compelled to take an oath in any case involving a claim from the orphans.

### Part 10
<b>And some say</b> this <i>halakha</i> in the form of <b>a <i>baraita</i>,</b> not as a quote from an <i>amora</i>: <b>Abba Shaul ben Imma Miriam said: Whether</b> he wrote: <b>Not an oath,</b> or <b>whether</b> he wrote: <b>Clear</b> from <b>an oath,</b> and <b>whether</b> he wrote: <b>Not a vow,</b> or <b>whether</b> he wrote: <b>Clear</b> from <b>a vow,</b> and <b>whether</b> he added: <b>From my property,</b> or <b>whether</b> he added: <b>From these properties, neither he nor his heirs can administer an oath to her</b> according to the letter of the law. <b>However, what can I do, as the Sages said</b> that <b>one who comes to collect</b> a debt <b>from the property of orphans may collect</b> it <b>only by</b> means of <b>an oath?</b> The Gemara comments: <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The practical <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>ben Imma Miriam.</b>

### Part 11
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> A woman <b>who vitiates her marriage contract</b> by acknowledging that she has received partial payment <b>can collect</b> the rest of her marriage contract <b>only by</b> means of <b>an oath.</b> Similarly, if <b>one witness testifies that</b> her marriage contract <b>is paid, she can collect</b> it <b>only by</b> means of <b>an oath.</b>In any case where she seeks to claim her marriage contract <b>from the property of orphans, or from liened property</b> that has been sold to a third party, <b>or when not in</b> her husband’s <b>presence,</b> she <b>can collect</b> it <b>only by</b> means of <b>an oath.</b>

### Part 12
The mishna elaborates: With regard to a woman <b>who vitiates her marriage contract, how so,</b> how does this situation arise? If <b>her marriage contract was a thousand dinars, and</b> her husband <b>said to her: You</b> already <b>received your marriage contract, and she says: I received only one hundred dinars,</b> she has made a partial admission and <b>can collect</b> her marriage contract <b>only</b> by means of <b>an oath.</b>

### Part 13
If <b>one witness testifies that</b> her marriage contract <b>is paid, how so?</b> If <b>her marriage contract was a thousand dinars, and</b> her husband <b>said to her: You</b> already <b>received your marriage contract, and she says: I did not receive</b> payment, <b>and one witness testifies about</b> the marriage contract <b>that it is paid,</b> she <b>can collect</b> it <b>only by</b> means of <b>an oath.</b>

### Part 14
<b>From liened property, how so?</b> If while they were married the husband <b>sold his property to others, and she</b> comes to <b>collect</b> her marriage contract <b>from the purchasers, she can collect</b> it <b>only by</b> means of <b>an oath.</b> She may seize property from the purchasers because her husband’s obligation undertaken in the marriage contract predates his obligation in the document of sale.

### Part 15
<b>From the property of orphans, how so?</b> If the husband <b>died and left his property to orphans, and she</b> comes to <b>collect</b> her marriage contract <b>from the orphans,</b> she <b>can collect</b> it <b>only by</b> means of <b>an oath.</b>

### Part 16
<b>Or when not in his presence, how so?</b> If <b>he went</b> to <b>a country overseas and</b> sent her a bill of divorce, so that <b>she collects</b> her marriage contract <b>when not in his presence,</b> she <b>can collect</b> it <b>only by</b> means of <b>an oath.</b>
