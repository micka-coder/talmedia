### Part 1
<b>However, what is the reason</b> that a widow <b>from betrothal</b> may sell property when not in court? <b>Ulla said: Due to desirability.</b> The Sages enacted several ordinances on behalf of women, so that men will want to marry them. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Because a man does not want his wife to be disgraced</b> by being involved <b>in court</b> proceedings.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between</b> the two opinions? The Gemara answers: The practical difference <b>between them</b> is in the case of <b>a divorcée. According to the one who says</b> that it is <b>due to desirability, a divorcée also requires desirability.</b> But <b>according to the one who says</b> that it is <b>because a man does not want his wife to be disgraced in court,</b> a man <b>does not care</b> if his <b>ex-wife</b> is disgraced.

### Part 3
<b>We learned</b> in the mishna (97b): <b>And a divorcée may sell only in court.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> that this is <b>because a man does not want his wife to be disgraced in court,</b> here <b>he does not care</b> if his <b>ex-wife</b> is disgraced. <b>However, according to the one who says</b> that it is <b>due to desirability, a divorcée also requires desirability,</b> so why should she be required to sell in court?

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> continuation of the mishna? <b>It is</b> according to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> in the mishna, who explains that anyone who is selling property to receive payment of her marriage contract and not for sustenance is required to sell only in court, and a divorcée does not receive sustenance.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> this is according to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> then wasn’t <b>it</b> already <b>taught in the first clause</b> that a widow <b>from betrothal sells</b> only in court because she does not receive sustenance? Since the same reasoning applies to a divorcée, why would the mishna have to teach the <i>halakha</i> again in this case?

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: It was necessary, <b>lest you say:</b> In the case of <b>a widow from betrothal, she is not</b> in <b>great</b> need of <b>her desirability,</b> as she has not been tarnished through sexual relations and men will not hold back from marrying her, and therefore she can go to the court to manage her affairs; <b>however, a divorcée, who is</b> in <b>great</b> need of <b>her desirability</b> and needs assistance in getting remarried, <b>say</b> that she <b>requires desirability</b> so that she will not be disgraced and she is allowed to take care of her affairs out of court. Lest you make this argument, the <i>halakha</i> was clearly stated in the mishna.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: Didn’t <b>we</b> already <b>learn</b> this <i>halakha</i>, as it <b>also</b> says in the mishna the following generalization: <b>And anyone who does not receive sustenance</b> may sell only in court? This <i>halakha</i> was intended <b>to add what?</b> Was <b>it not</b> meant <b>to add</b> the case of a <b>divorcée</b> and teach that she can sell only in court, in which case the concluding remark of the mishna about the divorcée is superfluous?

### Part 8
The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> it is <b>to include</b> a woman about whom there is uncertainty whether <b>she is divorced or</b> whether <b>she is not divorced, and it is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Zeira, as Rabbi Zeira said: Wherever it was said:</b> A woman that there is uncertainty whether <b>she is divorced or</b> whether <b>she is not divorced,</b> her <b>husband is obligated</b> to provide <b>her sustenance</b> until the divorce is final, and a woman in this situation may sell out of court as well.

### Part 9
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof: <b>Just as</b> the widow <b>sells when not in court, so too, her heirs,</b> those who <b>inherit her marriage contract, sell when not in court. Granted, according to the one who says</b> that the reason why she may sell out of court is <b>because a man does not want his wife to be disgraced</b> by having to appear <b>in court,</b> it is possible to say that <b>just as he is not amenable</b> to the idea <b>that she will be disgraced, he also is not amenable</b> to the idea <b>that her heirs will be disgraced. However, according to the one who says</b> that she sells out of court <b>due to desirability, what desirability do her heirs</b> need to <b>have? Ulla interpreted it:</b> This could take place, <b>for example,</b> when <b>her daughter or her sister inherited</b> from <b>her,</b> and they too need desirability.

### Part 10
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If a woman <b>sold all or part of her marriage contract,</b> or if <b>she mortgaged all or part of her marriage contract,</b> or if <b>she gave</b> away as a gift <b>all or part of her marriage contract to another,</b> then <b>she sells the remainder only in court. And the Rabbis say: She sells even four or five times,</b> and she is not obligated to sell everything at one time. <b>And</b> despite selling several times, she <b>sells for</b> her <b>sustenance</b> even <b>when not in court, and she writes</b> in the bill of sale: <b>I sold</b> this <b>for</b> my <b>sustenance.And a divorcée,</b> who does not receive sustenance, <b>sells only in court.</b>

### Part 11
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Whose</b> opinion is expressed in the <b>mishna?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>she sold</b> all of <b>her marriage contract,</b> or <b>mortgaged her marriage contract,</b> or if <b>she made her marriage contract designated repayment to another, she does not</b> receive <b>sustenance</b> any longer; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Shimon says: Although she has not sold or mortgaged her</b> entire <b>marriage contract, but only half of it, she has lost her</b> right to <b>sustenance.</b> Therefore, she can only sell the rest of her marriage contract in court.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that Rabbi Shimon holds that we do not say</b> that <b>part of the money</b> has a status <b>like the entire</b> sum of <b>money?</b> Since she no longer has a claim to the entire sum of her marriage contract, it is as though she no longer has a marriage contract and loses her right to sustenance, <b>and the Rabbis hold that we</b> do <b>say part of the money is like the entire money.</b>

### Part 13
Didn’t <b>we hear them say the opposite? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning the verse that speaks about the High Priest (Leviticus 21:13): <b>“And he</b> shall take <b>a wife in her virginity,” to exclude a grown woman whose</b> sign of <b>virginity has diminished</b> because when a girl goes through puberty her hymen wears away; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon declare as fit even a grown woman</b> for the High Priest. This implies that they are of the opinion that the absence of a part is not considered the absence of the whole, and although part of her sign of virginity has been diminished, it is still present.

### Part 14
The Gemara answers: <b>There they disagree</b> with regard to the interpretation of the <b>verses. Rabbi Meir holds</b> that were it stated in the verse <b>a virgin,</b> this general term would have indicated that as long as she is a virgin, <b>even if</b> she has only <b>part</b> of her sign of <b>virginity,</b> she could marry the High Priest. However, since the verse states: <b>“Her virginity,”</b> it means to say <b>until there is</b> a sign of <b>virginity in its entirety.</b> The addition of the prefix “in” to the phrase <b>“in her virginity”</b> teaches that if she engaged in sexual intercourse <b>in the typical manner,</b> i.e., in the place where her sign of virginity lies, then <b>yes,</b> it is considered that she has engaged in sexual intercourse and is no longer considered a virgin. But if she engaged in <b>sexual intercourse in an atypical manner,</b> i.e., anal intercourse, then she is <b>not</b> considered to have engaged in sexual intercourse.

### Part 15
By contrast, <b>Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon hold</b> that the word <b>virgin implies a complete virgin,</b> whose sign of virginity is completely intact. Therefore, when the verse says: <b>“Her virginity,”</b> it indicates that <b>even if</b> she has only <b>part of</b> her sign of <b>virginity,</b> in this regard she is still considered a virgin.
