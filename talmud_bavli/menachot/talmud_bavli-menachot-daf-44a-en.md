is <b>more lowly</b> than a woman, and therefore it is appropriate to recite an additional blessing on not having been born a slave.

### Part 2
§ <b>The Sages taught: This <i>ḥilazon</i>,</b> which <b>is</b> the source of the sky-blue dye used in ritual fringes, has the following characteristics: <b>Its body resembles the sea, its form resembles</b> that of <b>a fish, it emerges once in seventy years, and with its blood one dyes</b> wool <b>sky-blue</b> for ritual fringes. It is scarce, and <b>therefore it is expensive.</b>

### Part 3
It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Natan says: There is no mitzva,</b> however <b>minor, that is written in the Torah, for which there is no reward given in this world; and in the World-to-Come I do not know how much</b> reward is given. <b>Go and learn from</b> the following incident concerning <b>the mitzva of ritual fringes.</b>

### Part 4
There was <b>an incident involving a certain man who was diligent about the mitzva of ritual fringes.</b> This man <b>heard that there was a prostitute in</b> one of <b>the cities overseas who took four hundred gold coins as her payment. He sent her four hundred gold coins and fixed a time to</b> meet with <b>her. When his time came, he came and sat at the entrance</b> to her house.

### Part 5
<b>The maidservant of</b> that prostitute <b>entered and said to her: That man who sent you four hundred gold coins came and sat at the entrance. She said: Let him enter. He entered. She arranged seven beds for him, six of silver and one of gold. Between each and every one</b> of them there was <b>a ladder</b> made <b>of silver, and the top</b> bed was the one that was made <b>of gold.</b>

### Part 6
<b>She went up and sat naked on the top</b> bed, <b>and he too went up</b> in order <b>to sit naked facing her.</b> In the meantime, <b>his four ritual fringes came and slapped him on his face. He dropped down and sat himself on the ground, and she also dropped down and sat on the ground. She said to him:</b> I take an oath by the <b><i>gappa</i> of Rome that I will not allow you</b> to go <b>until you tell me what defect you saw in me.</b>

### Part 7
<b>He said to her:</b> I take an oath by <b>the Temple</b> service <b>that I never saw a woman as beautiful as you. But</b> there is <b>one mitzva</b> that <b>the Lord, our God, commanded us, and its name is ritual fringes, and in</b> the passage where <b>it</b> is commanded, <b>it is written twice: “I am the Lord your God”</b> (Numbers 15:41). The doubling of this phrase indicates: <b>I am the one who will punish</b> those who transgress My mitzvot, <b>and I am the one who will reward</b> those who fulfill them. <b>Now,</b> said the man, the four sets of ritual fringes <b>appeared to me as</b> if they were <b>four witnesses</b> who will testify against me.

### Part 8
<b>She said to him: I will not allow you</b> to go <b>until you tell me: What is your name, and what is the name of your city, and what is the name of your teacher, and what is the name of the study hall in which you studied Torah? He wrote</b> the information <b>and placed</b> it <b>in her hand.</b>

### Part 9
<b>She arose and divided all of her property,</b> giving <b>one-third</b> as a bribe <b>to the government, one-third to the poor, and she took one-third</b> with her <b>in her possession, in addition to those beds</b> of gold and silver.

### Part 10
<b>She came to the study hall of Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> and <b>said to him: My teacher, instruct</b> your students <b>concerning me and</b> have them <b>make me a convert.</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>said to her: My daughter, perhaps you set your sights on one of the students</b> and that is why you want to convert? <b>She took</b> the <b>note</b> the student had given her <b>from her hand and gave it to</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya. <b>He said to her: Go take possession of your purchase.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Those beds that she had arranged for him in a prohibited</b> fashion, <b>she</b> now <b>arranged for him in a permitted</b> fashion. The Gemara completes its point about the reward of mitzvot and points out how this story illustrates the concept: <b>This is the reward given to him in this world, and</b> with regard <b>to the World-to-Come, I do not know how much</b> reward he will be given.

### Part 12
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> In the case of <b>a borrowed cloak, for</b> the first <b>thirty days it is exempt from ritual fringes; from then on</b> it is <b>obligated.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara notes: <b>That</b> distinction <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who resides in a guesthouse [<i>pundaki</i>] in Eretz Yisrael, or one who rents a house outside of Eretz Yisrael, for</b> the first <b>thirty days</b> he is <b>exempt from the</b> mitzva of <b><i>mezuza</i>; from then on</b> he is <b>obligated. But one who rents a house in Eretz Yisrael</b> must <b>affix a <i>mezuza</i> immediately, due to</b> the <b>settlement of Eretz Yisrael.</b>

### Part 14
§ The mishna teaches: Absence of the <b>phylacteries of</b> the <b>arm does not prevent</b> fulfillment of the mitzva of the phylacteries of the head, and absence of the phylacteries of the head does not prevent fulfillment of the mitzva of the phylacteries of the arm. <b>Rav Ḥisda said: They taught</b> this <b>only</b> in a case <b>where one has</b> the other phylacteries, but they are not with him or he is unable to wear them for some reason. <b>But</b> if <b>he does not have</b> the other phylacteries at all, then their absence <b>does prevent</b> the fulfillment of the mitzva to don the phylacteries that he has.

### Part 15
Later on, the students <b>said to him:</b> Do <b>you</b> still <b>say</b> that? Rav Ḥisda <b>said to them: No, rather</b> I would say the opposite: Concerning <b>one who does not have</b> the ability to fulfill <b>two mitzvot, should he also not perform</b> the <b>one mitzva</b> that he does have the ability to fulfill? The Gemara asks: <b>And what did he hold initially</b> when he said not to don one of the phylacteries in the absence of the other? The Gemara answers: He held that it was due to a rabbinic <b>decree, lest he be negligent</b> and not try to acquire the phylacteries that he lacks.

### Part 16
<b>Rav Sheshet says: Anyone who does not don phylacteries violates eight positive mitzvot.</b> This is referring to the mitzva to don phylacteries of the arm and head, each of which is mentioned in four different passages (Exodus 13:9; Exodus 13:16; Deuteronomy 6:8; Deuteronomy 11:18).

### Part 17
<b>And anyone who does not have ritual fringes on his garments violates five positive mitzvot.</b> This is because the mitzva of ritual fringes is stated four times in the primary passage concerning ritual fringes in Numbers: “That they prepare for themselves strings…and they shall put on the fringe of the corner a sky-blue thread. And it shall be to you for a fringe that you may look upon it and remember all the commandments of the Lord” (Numbers 15:38–39). An additional command appears in the verse: “You shall prepare yourself twisted cords” (Deuteronomy 22:12).

### Part 18
<b>And any priest who does not ascend the platform</b> to recite the Priestly Benediction <b>violates three positive mitzvot</b> expressed in the verses: “So you shall bless the children of Israel; you shall say to them” (Numbers 6:23), and: “And they shall put My name upon the children of Israel” (Numbers 6:27).

### Part 19
<b>Anyone who does not have a <i>mezuza</i> in his doorway violates two positive mitzvot,</b> stated in the verses: <b>“And you shall write them</b> on the doorposts of your house” (Deuteronomy 6:9), and: <b>“And you shall write them</b> on the doorposts of your house” (Deuteronomy 11:20).

### Part 20
<b>And Reish Lakish says: Anyone who dons phylacteries lives</b> a <b>long life, as it is stated:</b>
