Rabbi Beivai concludes: <b>And that man,</b> i.e., I, <b>relies on a baker.</b> Therefore, my mind is not sufficiently settled to answer the question properly.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about</b> this question? <b>Rav Yosef said: Rabbi Yehuda was the halakhic decisor of the house of the <i>Nasi</i>, and he instructed</b> them <b>according to his tradition</b> that the blood of an animal carcass is impure.

### Part 3
<b>As we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that <b>six matters are among the leniencies of Beit Shammai and among the stringencies of Beit Hillel.</b> They include <b>the blood of a carcass,</b> which <b>Beit Shammai deem ritually pure,</b> as in their opinion only the flesh of a carcass imparts impurity; <b>and Beit Hillel deem</b> it <b>ritually impure. Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, said: Even when Beit Hillel deemed</b> it <b>impure, they deemed</b> it <b>impure only</b> when it is <b>in</b> the quantity of at least <b>a quarter-</b><i>log</i>, <b>since</b> that amount, were it <b>to congeal, could constitute an olive-bulk,</b> which is the minimum amount of the flesh of a carcass that is deemed impure.

### Part 4
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One does not pledge</b> a libation of one <b><i>log</i>, two</b> <i>log</i>, <b>or five</b> <i>log</i> of wine, because there are no existing libations with those measures of wine. <b>But one pledges</b> a libation of <b>three</b> <i>log</i>, which is the measure of wine brought with a lamb, <b>or four</b> <i>log</i>, which is the measure of wine brought with a ram, <b>or six</b> <i>log</i>, which is the measure of wine brought with a bull. <b>And</b> one may pledge a libation of <b>six</b> <i>log</i> <b>and beyond,</b> as any greater amount can be composed of combinations of these three.

### Part 5
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>Is there a fixed</b> amount <b>for libations,</b> in that when one vows to bring a certain number of <i>log</i> of wine they are not offered separately, <b>or is there no fixed</b> amount <b>for libations,</b> and it is permitted to divide them and offer them in smaller amounts?

### Part 6
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What are the circumstances?</b> It is a case <b>where he brought five</b> <i>log</i> of wine. <b>If you say</b> that <b>there is no fixed</b> amount <b>for libations,</b> then <b>he removes and offers four of them, as</b> those <b>are suitable for</b> the libations of <b>a ram, and the other</b> <i>log</i>, which is not of sufficient volume, <b>is</b> allocated for communal <b>gift</b> offerings. Either it itself is offered, or it is redeemed and the money is used to buy offerings for the repletion of the altar, i.e., for times when the altar is idle. But <b>if you say</b> that <b>there is a fixed</b> amount <b>for libations</b> and the wine may not be divided and offered separately, then it <b>is not offered</b> itself or redeemed with money and offered <b>until he adds to</b> the existing measurement such that the total number of <i>log</i> may be offered as an independent libation.

### Part 7
<b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Abaye said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the answer from a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 6:5): There were <b>six</b> collection horns <b>for</b> communal <b>gift</b> offerings, <b>and we say: For what</b> were they <b>designated?</b> They were designated <b>for</b> funds <b>left over</b> from the purchase of <b>sin offerings,</b> for funds <b>left over</b> from <b>the</b> purchase of <b>guilt offerings,</b> for funds <b>left over</b> from <b>the</b> purchase of a <b>guilt offering of a nazirite,</b> for funds <b>left over</b> from the purchase of the <b>guilt offering of a leper,</b> for funds <b>left over</b> from the purchase of <b>pairs</b> of birds, and for funds <b>left over</b> from the purchase of the <b>meal offering of a sinner.</b>

### Part 8
<b>And if it is so</b> that there is no fixed amount for libations, and if one vowed to bring five <i>log</i> then four are offered as a ram’s libation and the fifth can be redeemed and its money used for a communal gift offering, then <b>let them institute an additional</b> collection <b>horn</b> in the Temple for funds <b>left over</b> from the purchase <b>of libations.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara responds: <b>These</b> six horns are dedicated to funds that <b>go to communal gift offerings,</b> and <b>these</b> <i>log</i> of wine left over from libations <b>are common,</b> so there is no need to store them, since it is <b>possible</b> that the libation <b>of this person</b> will <b>be combined with</b> the libation of another <b>person together</b> in order to reach the desired amount, <b>and</b> then it <b>is offered</b> immediately. Therefore, no additional horn was necessary for the money from the redemption of libations.

### Part 10
<b>Rava said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to the dilemma from a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah states with regard to libations: “All that are <b>home born</b> shall do these things in this manner, in presenting an offering made by fire, of a pleasing aroma to the Lord” (Numbers 15:13). As this verse is superfluous, the various terms in it are used to derive <i>halakhot</i>. The term <b>“home born” teaches that one may pledge libations</b> even when they are not sacrificed together with an offering. <b>And how much</b> is the minimum volume that is offered? <b>Three <i>log</i>,</b> which is the smallest measurement of a libation in the Torah, i.e., the libation that is offered with a lamb.

### Part 11
<b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that if one desires to add</b> to this amount <b>he may add? The verse states</b> with regard to libations associated with the additional offerings for the New Moon: “And their libations: Half a <i>hin</i> of wine <b>shall be</b> for the bull, and one-third of a <i>hin</i> for the ram, and one-quarter of a <i>hin</i> for the lamb” (Numbers 28:14). From the superfluous “shall be” one may understand that there are others, and derive that independent libations may also be brought. <b>Can</b> one <b>decrease</b> the amount of wine in a libation to less than three <i>log</i>? <b>The verse states:</b> “All that are home born shall do these things, <b>in this manner”</b> (Numbers 15:13), i.e., one may not bring less than three <i>log</i> of wine.

### Part 12
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What</b> does the <i>baraita</i> mean when it says that <b>one may add</b> to the minimum of three <i>log</i> for an independent libation? <b>If we say</b> it means that it is permitted to offer <b>four or six</b> <i>log</i>, then <b>what is different</b> about <b>three</b> <i>log</i> that it was specified? It is <b>because it is suitable for</b> the libations of <b>a lamb.</b> If so, then <b>four or six</b> <i>log</i> are <b>also suitable,</b> as four <i>log</i> is offered as the libation <b>for a ram and</b> six <i>log</i> is offered as the libation for <b>a bull. Rather,</b> in saying that one may add, <b>isn’t</b> the <i>baraita</i> referring to <b>five</b> <i>log</i> of wine, despite the fact that it is not a measurement used with any of the offerings? <b>And learn from</b> this <i>baraita</i> that <b>there is no fixed</b> amount <b>for libations.</b> The Gemara affirms: Indeed, <b>learn from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that this is so.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Ashi said: But didn’t we learn this</b> in the mishna: <b>One does not pledge</b> a libation of one <b><i>log</i>, two</b> <i>log</i>, <b>or five</b> <i>log</i> of wine? Rav Ashi continues: In phrasing the mishna in this manner, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> that the status of <b>five</b> <i>log</i> is <b>similar</b> to the status <b>of two</b> <i>log</i>: <b>Just as two</b> <i>log</i> <b>are not suitable at all</b> to be offered independently, <b>so too, five</b> <i>log</i> are <b>also not suitable at all</b> to offer, as there are no libations of this size. This demonstrates that there is a fixed amount to libations, and one may not divide them into two.

### Part 14
The Gemara responds: <b>Are the cases comparable? This,</b> two <i>log</i>, is <b>as it is, and that,</b> five <i>log</i>, is <b>as it is,</b> and there is no reason to compare them. Four of the five <i>log</i> are offered, with the fifth allocated for a communal gift offering.

### Part 15
<b>Abaye said: If you say</b> that <b>there is no fixed</b> amount <b>for libations, then there is no fixed</b> amount <b>for libations,</b> and no further discussion is necessary. <b>If you say</b> that <b>there is a fixed</b> amount <b>for libations,</b> then the <i>halakha</i> of <b>up to ten</b> <i>log</i> of wine is <b>obvious to me.</b> One <i>log</i>, two <i>log</i>, or five <i>log</i> may not be brought, since these amounts are not offered as standard libations, but three, four, or six <i>log</i> are brought, as their amount is equivalent to those of standard libations. Between six and ten <i>log</i> may also be brought, since these amounts can be composed of a combination of the various wine libations. With regard to <b>eleven</b> <i>log</i>,
