### Part 1
<b>the sharp</b> people in the city <b>of Pumbedita: Burning renders burning <i>piggul</i>,</b> e.g., burning the handful with the intent to burn the frankincense the next day renders the meal offering <i>piggul</i>. <b>And</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even according to the Rabbis, who say</b> that <b>one does not render</b> an offering <b><i>piggul</i> with</b> intent occurring during the sacrifice of <b>half of a permitting factor,</b> e.g., when sacrificing the handful alone with intent of <i>piggul</i>. The reason is that <b>this statement</b> applies only <b>where he had intent during</b> the sacrifice of the handful to consume <b>the remainder</b> the next day, <b>and</b> the <b>frankincense stands intact,</b> i.e., he had no intent with regard to it. <b>But here, when he had intent with regard to the frankincense</b> while burning the handful, <b>it is considered as though he had intent with regard to the entire permitting factor.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rava said: We learn</b> this <i>halakha</i> in a mishna, <b>as well</b> (12a): <b>This is the principle:</b> In the case of <b>anyone who removes the handful, or places</b> the handful <b>in the vessel,</b> or <b>who conveys</b> the vessel with the handful to the altar, or <b>who burns</b> the handful on the altar, with the intent <b>to partake of an item whose</b> typical <b>manner</b> is such that one <b>partakes</b> of it, <b>or to burn an item whose</b> typical <b>manner</b> is such that one <b>burns</b> it on the altar, <b>outside its</b> designated <b>area,</b> the meal offering is <b>unfit but there is no</b> liability for <b><i>karet</i>.</b> If his intent was to do so <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time,</b> the offering is <b><i>piggul</i> and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> on account of it.</b>

### Part 3
Rava explains: <b>What, is it not</b> correct to say that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>burning</b> is <b>similar to these,</b> i.e., the removal of the handful, its placement in a vessel, and the conveying? Accordingly, <b>just as</b> with regard to <b>these, whether</b> one’s intent was <b>to partake</b> of the remainder the next day <b>or to burn</b> the frankincense the next day, the <i>halakha</i> is that the offering is <i>piggul</i>, <b>so too</b> with regard to <b>burning, whether</b> one’s intent was <b>to partake</b> of the remainder <b>or to burn</b> the frankincense the next day, the offering is <i>piggul</i>.

### Part 4
The Gemara rejects this comparison: <b>No,</b> with regard to <b>these, whether</b> one’s intent was <b>to partake</b> of the remainder <b>or to burn</b> the frankincense the next day, the offering is in fact <i>piggul</i>. But with regard to <b>burning,</b> if one’s intent was <b>to partake</b> of the remainder the next day, <b>yes,</b> it is <i>piggul</i>, but if one’s intent was <b>to burn</b> the frankincense the next day, it is <b>not</b> <i>piggul</i>.

### Part 5
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Menashya bar Gadda sat before Abaye, and</b> while he was <b>sitting he said in the name of Rav Ḥisda: Burning does not render burning <i>piggul</i>,</b> e.g., burning the handful with the intent to burn the frankincense the next day does not render the offering <i>piggul</i>. <b>And</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says</b> in the mishna that one <b>renders</b> an offering <b><i>piggul</i></b> through intent <b>during</b> the sacrifice of <b>half</b> of <b>a permitting factor,</b> e.g., when sacrificing the handful but not the frankincense with intent of <i>piggul</i>.

### Part 6
Rav Menashya bar Gadda explains that the reason is that <b>this statement</b> of Rabbi Meir applies only <b>where he had intent during</b> the sacrifice of the handful to consume <b>the remainder</b> the next day, <b>as the handful</b> is <b>their permitting factor. But here, as the handful is not a permitting factor of the frankincense,</b> the offering <b>cannot be rendered <i>piggul</i> through it.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Menashya: <b>Answer me, my Master,</b> did Rav Ḥisda state this <i>halakha</i> <b>in the name of Rav?</b> Rav Menashya <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>Yes.</b> The Gemara notes that it <b>was also stated</b> explicitly that <b>Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>Rav says: Burning does not render burning <i>piggul</i>.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rav Ya’akov bar Idi said in the name of Abaye: We learn</b> in the mishna <b>as well</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rav: If <b>one slaughtered one of the lambs</b> with the intent <b>to partake of it the next day, that</b> lamb is <b><i>piggul</i> and the other</b> lamb is <b>fit.</b> If he slaughtered one lamb with the intent <b>to partake of the other the next day, both</b> lambs <b>are fit. What is the reason?</b> Is it <b>not due to the fact that since</b> the first lamb <b>is not a permitting factor of</b> the second lamb, <b>it cannot render</b> the second lamb <b><i>piggul</i>?</b> The same reasoning should apply to the case of the handful and frankincense.

### Part 9
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No;</b> there is a difference between these cases. <b>It is</b> only <b>there,</b> in the mishna, that one lamb cannot render the other <i>piggul</i>, <b>as it was not fixed in one vessel</b> with the other lamb, and therefore each animal stands independent of the other. <b>But here, as</b> the handful and frankincense <b>were fixed in one vessel</b> for the purpose of offering them, <b>they are considered like one</b> item and one of them therefore renders the other <i>piggul</i>.

### Part 10
§ <b>Rav Hamnuna said: Rabbi Ḥanina helped me internalize this</b> following <b>matter, and to me it is equivalent to all</b> the rest of <b>my learning,</b> as it contains a significant novelty: If <b>one burned</b> the <b>handful</b> with the intent <b>to burn</b> the <b>frankincense</b> the next day, <b>and</b> burned the <b>frankincense</b> with the intent <b>to partake of</b> the <b>remainder the next day,</b> the meal offering is <b><i>piggul</i>.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is Rabbi Ḥanina <b>teaching us? If</b> he <b>is teaching us</b> that <b>burning renders burning <i>piggul</i>,</b> then <b>let him</b> simply <b>say:</b> If one <b>burned</b> the <b>handful</b> with the intent <b>to burn</b> the <b>frankincense,</b> the offering is <i>piggul</i>. <b>If</b> he <b>is teaching us</b> that one <b>renders</b> an offering <b><i>piggul</i></b> through intent <b>during</b> the sacrifice of <b>half of a permitting factor,</b> then <b>let him say:</b> If one <b>burned</b> the <b>handful</b> with the intent <b>to partake of</b> the <b>remainder the next day,</b> the offering is <i>piggul</i>. <b>If</b> he <b>is coming</b> to <b>teach us both of</b> these <i>halakhot</i>, <b>let him say:</b> If one <b>burned</b> the <b>handful</b> with the intent <b>to burn</b> the <b>frankincense or to partake of</b> the <b>remainder the next day,</b> the offering is <i>piggul</i>.

### Part 12
<b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said: Actually,</b> Rabbi Ḥanina <b>holds</b> that <b>burning does not render burning <i>piggul</i>,</b> and therefore if one burned only the handful with the intent to burn the frankincense the next day, the offering is not <i>piggul</i>. <b>And</b> he also holds that one <b>does not render</b> an offering <b><i>piggul</i></b> through intent <b>during</b> the sacrifice of <b>half of a permitting factor,</b> and consequently if one burned only the handful with the intent to partake of the remainder the next day, the offering is not <i>piggul</i> either. <b>But</b> it <b>is different here, as intent</b> of <i>piggul</i> has <b>extended over the entire meal offering,</b> as he had intent of <i>piggul</i> during the burning of the handful with regard to the frankincense and during the burning of the frankincense with regard to the remainder.

### Part 13
The Gemara relates that <b>a <i>tanna</i> taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Yitzḥak bar Abba:</b> If <b>one burned</b> the <b>handful</b> with the intent <b>to partake of</b> the <b>remainder</b> the next day, <b>everyone agrees</b> that the meal offering is <b><i>piggul</i>.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But don’t</b> Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis <b>disagree</b> in the mishna with regard to this very case? <b>Rather, say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> states: <b>Everyone agrees</b> that the offering is <b>disqualified,</b> as although the Rabbis hold that such intent does not render an offering <i>piggul</i>, they concede that it disqualifies the offering.

### Part 14
The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> if one must emend the <i>baraita</i>, <b>let him say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> states: <b>It is <i>piggul</i>, and</b> that <b>it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir.</b> The Gemara responds: It is reasonable that the <b><i>tanna</i> taught</b> that <b>everyone agrees,</b> and that he accidentally <b>exchanged</b> the word <b><i>piggul</i> for disqualified.</b> But <b>he would not confuse</b> the phrase: <b>This is</b> the opinion of Rabbi Meir, <b>with</b> the phrase: <b>Everyone agrees.</b>

### Part 16
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who removes a handful from the meal offering</b> with the intent <b>to consume</b>, beyond its designated time, <b>an item whose</b> typical <b>manner</b> is such that one does <b>not consume</b> it, i.e., the handful, <b>or to burn,</b> beyond its designated time, <b>an item whose</b> typical <b>manner</b> is such that one does <b>not burn</b> it on the altar, i.e., the remainder of the meal offering, the meal offering is <b>fit. Rabbi Eliezer deems</b> it <b>unfit,</b> although it is not <i>piggul</i>, and consuming it is therefore not punishable by excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>].

### Part 17
In the case of one who removes a handful from the meal offering with the intent <b>to consume,</b> beyond its designated time, <b>an item whose</b> typical <b>manner</b> is such that one does <b>consume</b> it, <b>or to burn,</b> beyond its designated time, <b>an item whose</b> typical <b>manner</b> is such that one does <b>burn</b> it on the altar, but his intent was to consume or burn improperly <b>less than an olive-bulk,</b> the offering is <b>fit.</b> If his intent was both <b>to consume half an olive-bulk and to burn half an olive-bulk</b> beyond its designated time, the meal offering is nevertheless <b>fit, because eating and burning do not join together.</b>

### Part 18
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: What is the reason</b> for the ruling <b>of Rabbi Eliezer</b> that the intention to consume, beyond its designated time, an item that is not usually consumed renders the meal offering unfit? <b>The verse states</b> with regard to consuming an offering after its designated time: <b>“And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings is at all consumed [<i>he’akhol ye’akhel</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 7:18), repeating for emphasis the term for consumption. He derives from the repeated term that <b>the verse is speaking of two</b> types of <b>consumption: One</b> is <b>the consumption</b> of the offering <b>by a person,</b> e.g., by the priests or the owner of the offering, <b>and</b> the other <b>one is the consumption</b> of the sacrificial portions <b>by</b> their being burned on the <b>altar.</b> This serves <b>to tell you</b> that <b>just as</b> one’s improper <b>intention with regard to the consumption of a person</b> renders the offering unfit, <b>so too,</b> one’s improper <b>intention with regard to the consumption of</b> the <b>altar</b> renders the offering unfit.

### Part 19
<b>And</b> furthermore, this serves to tell you that <b>just as</b> one’s improper <b>intention</b> that a portion of the offering designated for <b>consumption by a person</b> will be <b>consumed</b> on the following day <b>by a person</b> renders the offering unfit, <b>and</b> one’s improper <b>intention</b> that a portion of the offering designated for <b>consumption of</b> the <b>altar</b> will be <b>consumed</b> on the following day <b>by</b> the <b>altar</b> renders the offering unfit, <b>so too,</b> one’s improper <b>intention</b> that a portion of the offering designated for <b>consumption by a person</b> will be <b>consumed on</b> the <b>altar</b> renders the offering unfit, <b>and</b> one’s improper intention that a portion of the offering designated for <b>consumption of</b> the <b>altar</b> will be <b>consumed</b> on the following day <b>by a person</b> renders the offering unfit.

### Part 20
<b>What is the reason</b> for this derivation? It is derived <b>from</b> the fact <b>that the Merciful One expresses</b> the <b>burning</b> of the offering <b>using the language of consumption.</b>

### Part 21
<b>And the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Eliezer, maintain the following: <b>This</b> fact <b>that the Merciful One expresses</b> the burning of the offering <b>using the language of consumption</b>
