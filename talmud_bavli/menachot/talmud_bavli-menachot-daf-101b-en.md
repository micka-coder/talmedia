### Part 1
the flesh of <b>an ox that is stoned, a heifer whose neck is broken,the birds</b> sacrificed by <b>a leper</b> (see Leviticus 14:4–7), <b>a firstborn donkey</b> whose neck was broken, <b>and meat</b> cooked together <b>with milk are all</b> susceptible to <b>the ritual impurity of food,</b> despite the fact that they are forbidden for consumption.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Shimon says: None of them are susceptible to the ritual impurity of food,</b> since they are all items from which it is prohibited to derive benefit, and they are therefore not considered food. <b>And Rabbi Shimon concedes with regard to meat</b> cooked together <b>with milk that it is susceptible to the ritual impurity of food since it,</b> i.e., both the meat and the milk, <b>had a time</b> that it was <b>fit</b> for consumption before it was rendered forbidden.

### Part 3
<b>And Rav Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What is the reason for Rabbi Shimon’s</b> opinion that an item from which it is prohibited to derive benefit is not susceptible to impurity of food? It is because it is stated: <b>“All food which may be eaten [<i>ha’okhel asher ye’akhel</i>],</b> that on which water comes, shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:34). The redundancy in the phrase “food which may be eaten” indicates that specifically <b>food that you are able to feed to others,</b> in this case, gentiles, <b>is termed food</b> for the purposes of susceptibility to the impurity of food, but <b>food that you are not able to feed to others is not termed food.</b> Therefore, items from which it is prohibited to derive benefit and which it is therefore prohibited to feed to others are not considered food in this context.

### Part 4
Rabbi Oshaya explains how this can be applied to <i>piggul</i>: <b>A meal offering</b> that one <b>rendered <i>piggul</i> is also food that you are not able to feed to others,</b> as it is prohibited to derive benefit from it. Consequently, it is not susceptible to the ritual impurity of food according to Rabbi Shimon.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> why doesn’t he <b>also</b> derive that <b>meat</b> cooked <b>in milk</b> is susceptible to impurity <b>because it is food that you may feed to others,</b> as Rabbi Shimon maintains that it is permitted to derive benefit from meat and milk cooked together?

### Part 6
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon:</b> With regard to <b>meat</b> cooked <b>in milk, eating</b> it <b>is prohibited and</b> deriving <b>benefit</b> from it <b>is permitted, as it is stated: “For you are a holy people to the Lord your God; you shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:21). <b>And elsewhere</b> the verse <b>states: “And you shall be holy men to Me; therefore you shall not eat any flesh that is torn by animals [<i>tereifa</i>] in the field”</b> (Exodus 22:30). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to an animal torn by animals, which is forbidden as a <i>tereifa</i>, i.e., an animal possessing a wound that will cause it to die within twelve months, <b>eating</b> it <b>is prohibited but</b> deriving <b>benefit</b> from it <b>is permitted, so too here,</b> with regard to meat cooked in milk, where being a holy people is also mentioned, <b>eating</b> it <b>is forbidden but</b> deriving <b>benefit</b> from it <b>is permitted.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> that cites Rabbi Shimon’s opinion <b>states one</b> reason why meat cooked in milk is susceptible to impurity <b>and</b> adds <b>another. One</b> reason is <b>that</b> it <b>is food that you can feed to others.</b> Therefore, it is called food for the purpose of being susceptible to impurity. <b>And another</b> reason is that <b>even for him,</b> i.e., a Jew, although it is currently prohibited to eat the milk and meat, <b>it had a time</b> when each was <b>fit</b> to be eaten, i.e., before they were cooked together; therefore, they remain susceptible to impurity.

### Part 8
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rabbi Oshaya from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> that <b>there is</b> a case of the <b>leftover</b> of an offering <b>that is susceptible to the ritual impurity of food, but there is</b> also a case of the <b>leftover</b> of an offering <b>that is not susceptible to the impurity of food.</b>

### Part 9
<b>How so?</b> If it was <b>left overnight before</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood on the altar, it is not susceptible <b>to the ritual impurity of food,</b> as it never became fit for consumption. But if it was left overnight <b>after</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood, it <b>is susceptible to the ritual impurity of food,</b> since from after the sprinkling of the blood until it was left overnight, it was fit for consumption.

### Part 10
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> with regard to <b><i>piggul</i>, both in</b> cases of <b>offerings of the most sacred order as well as in</b> cases of <b>offerings of lesser sanctity,</b> the meat of the offering is not susceptible to <b>the impurity of food.</b> This is because it was rendered forbidden for consumption at the beginning of the sacrificial rite, and was never fit for consumption. If the priest <b>rendered a meal offering <i>piggul</i>,</b> it <b>is</b> susceptible to <b>the impurity of food,</b> since it did have a period of time when it was acceptable, i.e., when it was still flour before it was consecrated as a meal offering. This ruling contradicts Rabbi Oshaya’s understanding that according to Rabbi Shimon, a meal offering that became <i>piggul</i> is not susceptible to the impurity of food.

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: That is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>here,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> where Rabbi Shimon ruled that the meal offering that became <i>piggul</i> is susceptible to the impurity of food, it is referring to a case <b>where it had a time</b> in which <b>it</b> was <b>fit</b> for consumption. <b>There,</b> where it is not susceptible to the impurity of food, it is referring to a case <b>where it did not have a time</b> in which it was <b>fit</b> for consumption.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances where it did not have a time</b> in which it was <b>fit</b> for consumption? Before the flour was consecrated as a meal offering, it was certainly permitted for consumption. The Gemara answers: This would occur <b>where he consecrated</b> the wheat <b>while</b> it was still <b>attached</b> to the ground and was therefore not yet susceptible to impurity. Once harvested, it was already prohibited for consumption.

### Part 13
The Gemara raises a difficulty: The flour may still have a time in which it was fit. <b>Let him redeem it</b> before it is placed in a service vessel. Why is it regarded as not having a time in which it was fit for consumption? The Gemara qualifies the question: <b>This</b> distinction, between flour that came from wheat that was consecrated before it was harvested and wheat or flour that was consecrated at a later point, <b>works out well according to this version of</b> that which <b>Rabbi Oshaya said: Impure</b> meal offerings and libations that have not been consecrated in a service vessel <b>are redeemed;</b> if they are <b>pure,</b> they <b>are not redeemed.</b> Accordingly, it works out <b>well</b> that the flour does not have a time in which it was fit for consumption when it came from wheat that was consecrated before being harvested. It could not be redeemed and made fit for consumption.

### Part 14
<b>But according to this version of</b> what Rabbi Oshaya <b>said: Even pure</b> meal offerings and libations <b>are redeemed,</b> there remains the possibility of <b>letting him redeem</b> the meal offering while it is pure and before is consecrated in a service vessel. Therefore, it should be considered as having a time in which it is fit for consumption.

### Part 15
The Gemara answers: <b>In any event, now he has not redeemed it.</b> Therefore, it is not considered to have had a time in which it is fit for consumption.

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: How can the flour be considered as not having a time in which it is fit for consumption merely because he has not redeemed it, even though he could have redeemed it? <b>Since</b> in a case <b>where if</b> he <b>wants,</b> he <b>may redeem it,</b> don’t <b>we attribute to Rabbi Shimon that he said</b> that for <b>any</b> item <b>that stands to be redeemed,</b> it <b>is as if it</b> already <b>is redeemed?</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara cites a source for this assertion: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> A red <b>heifer,</b> even if it has been slaughtered and it is therefore prohibited to derive benefit from it, <b>is susceptible to the ritual impurity of food, since it had a time in which it was fit. And Reish Lakish said,</b> explaining how it is possible to derive from this <i>halakha</i> that any item that could be redeemed is considered as though it has been redeemed: <b>Rabbi Shimon would say</b> that a red <b>heifer is redeemed</b> with money even when it has already been slaughtered and placed <b>upon its pyre</b> in preparation for being burned. If so, a meal offering that could be redeemed should also be considered fit for consumption, as it is considered as though it has been redeemed.

### Part 18
The Gemara answers: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? Granted,</b> with regard to the red <b>heifer,</b> it <b>is</b> considered to be an item that <b>stands to be redeemed, since if he found another</b> animal <b>choicer than it,</b> there is <b>a mitzva to redeem</b> the first one and purchase the choicer one with the money. <b>But</b> is there <b>a mitzva to redeem these meal offerings?</b>

### Part 19
The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> there is a case where sacrificial meat <b>remained</b> overnight <b>before the sprinkling</b> of the blood occurred, <b>where there was a mitzva to sprinkle</b> the blood the day before, <b>and if he had wanted</b> he <b>could have sprinkled</b> it, and the offering would not have been disqualified. <b>And</b> yet, Rabbi Shimon <b>teaches</b> in the <i>baraita</i> <b>that</b> sacrificial meat that remained overnight <b>is not susceptible to the ritual impurity of food,</b> even though it should have been considered fit for consumption on the day the offering was slaughtered, as the blood stood to be sprinkled and there was a mitzva to sprinkle it.

### Part 20
The Gemara answers: <b>Here, we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where there was not</b> sufficient <b>time remaining in the day to sprinkle</b> the blood, as the offering was slaughtered close to sunset. Therefore, the blood did not stand to be sprinkled and the meat was therefore never fit for consumption.

### Part 21
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> in a case where the offering was slaughtered when <b>there was</b> sufficient <b>time remaining in the day</b> to sprinkle the blood, <b>what</b> would then be the <i>halakha</i> according to Rabbi Shimon? Would meat left overnight <b>be susceptible to the ritual impurity of food?</b>

### Part 22
If so, <b>rather than</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>teaching</b> the following: Sacrificial meat that was left overnight before the blood was sprinkled is not susceptible to the ritual impurity of food, but if <b>left overnight after</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood it <b>is susceptible to the ritual impurity of food,</b> instead <b>let him distinguish within</b> the case <b>itself: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> When is sacrificial meat left overnight without the blood of the offering having been sprinkled not susceptible to the ritual impurity of food? It is in a case <b>where there was not</b> sufficient <b>time remaining in the day</b> to sprinkle the blood; but if <b>there was</b> sufficient <b>time remaining in the day</b> to sprinkle the blood, it <b>is susceptible to the ritual impurity of food.</b>

### Part 23
The Gemara answers: <b>That is indeed what he is saying</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, that if the offering was <b>left overnight before</b> it was <b>available for sprinkling,</b> i.e., if it was slaughtered so late in the day that there was no time left to sprinkle the blood, it is not susceptible <b>to the ritual impurity of food.</b> By contrast, if it was left overnight <b>after</b> it was <b>available for sprinkling,</b> i.e., there was still time to sprinkle the blood, then it <b>is susceptible to the ritual impurity of food.</b>

### Part 24
The Gemara asks: Does Rabbi Shimon in fact hold that an item that stands to be redeemed is treated as though it has already been redeemed, and is therefore considered to have had a time in which it is fit, even if it was never actually redeemed? <b>But isn’t</b> it so that when one <b>renders either offerings of the most sacred order or offerings of lesser sanctity <i>piggul</i>,</b> there was <b>a mitzva to sprinkle</b> the blood once the offering was slaughtered,
