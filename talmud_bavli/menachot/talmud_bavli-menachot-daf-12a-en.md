### Part 1
the offering is <b><i>piggul</i>, and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> partaking of the remainder of that meal offering.

### Part 2
<b>This is the principle:</b> In the case of <b>anyone who removes the handful, or places</b> the handful <b>in the vessel,</b> or <b>who conveys</b> the vessel with the handful to the altar, or <b>who burns</b> the handful on the altar, with the intent <b>to partake of an item whose</b> typical <b>manner</b> is such that one <b>partakes</b> of it, e.g., the remainder, <b>or to burn an item whose</b> typical <b>manner</b> is such that one <b>burns</b> it on the altar, e.g., the handful or the frankincense, <b>outside its</b> designated <b>area,</b> the meal offering is <b>unfit but there is no</b> liability for <b><i>karet</i>.</b> If his intent was to do so <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time,</b> the offering is <b><i>piggul</i> and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> on account of it, provided that the permitting</b> factor, i.e., the handful, <b>was sacrificed in accordance with its mitzva.</b> If the permitting factor was not sacrificed in accordance with its mitzva, although the meal offering is unfit, the prohibition of <i>piggul</i> does not apply to it.

### Part 3
<b>How</b> is <b>the permitting factor</b> considered to have been <b>sacrificed in accordance with its mitzva?</b> If one <b>removed the handful in silence,</b> i.e., with no specific intent, and <b>placed</b> it <b>in the vessel, conveyed</b> it, <b>and burned</b> the handful on the altar, with the intent to partake of the remainder <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time; or</b> if one <b>removed the handful</b> with the intent to partake of the or burn the handful or frankincense <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time,</b> and <b>placed</b> it <b>in the vessel, and conveyed</b> it, <b>and burned</b> the handful on the altar <b>in silence,</b> with no specific intent; <b>or</b> if one <b>removed the handful</b> and <b>placed</b> it <b>in the vessel, conveyed</b> it, <b>and burned</b> the handful on the altar, with the intent to partake of the remainder <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time, that is</b> the case of an offering <b>whose permitting factor was sacrificed in accordance with its mitzva,</b> and one is liable to receive <i>karet</i> for partaking of it due to <i>piggul</i>.

### Part 4
<b>How</b> is <b>the permitting factor not sacrificed in accordance with its mitzva?</b> If one <b>removed the handful</b> with the intent to partake of the remainder or burn the handful or frankincense <b>outside its</b> designated <b>area,</b> or <b>placed</b> it <b>in the vessel, conveyed</b> it, <b>and burned</b> the handful on the altar, with the intent to partake of the remainder <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time; or</b> if one <b>removed the handful</b> with the intent to partake of the remainder or burn the handful or frankincense <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time,</b> and <b>placed</b> it <b>in the vessel, conveyed</b> it, <b>and burned</b> the handful on the altar, with the intent to partake of the remainder <b>outside its</b> designated <b>area; or</b> if one <b>removed the handful</b> and <b>placed</b> it <b>in the vessel, and conveyed</b> it, <b>and burned</b> the handful on the altar, with the intent to partake of the remainder <b>outside its</b> designated <b>area, that is</b> the case of an offering <b>whose permitting factor was not sacrificed in accordance with its mitzva.</b>

### Part 5
<b>The meal offering of a sinner and the meal offering of jealousy</b> brought by a <i>sota</i> <b>that one removed their handful not for their sake</b> and <b>placed</b> it <b>in the vessel, conveyed</b> it, <b>and burned</b> the handful on the altar, with the intent to partake of the remainder or burn the handful <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time; or that one removed the handful</b> with the intent to partake of the remainder or burn the handful <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time</b> or <b>placed</b> it <b>in the vessel, conveyed</b> it, <b>and burned</b> the handful on the altar, <b>not for their sake; or that one removed the handful, and placed</b> it <b>in the vessel, and conveyed</b> it, <b>and burned</b> the handful on the altar, <b>not for their sake, that is</b> the case of an offering <b>whose permitting factor was not sacrificed in accordance with its mitzva.</b>

### Part 6
If one performed one of these rites with the intent <b>to partake of an olive-bulk outside</b> its designated area and <b>an olive-bulk the next day,</b> or <b>an olive-bulk the next day</b> and <b>an olive-bulk outside</b> its designated area, or <b>half an olive-bulk outside</b> its designated area and <b>half an olive-bulk the next day,</b> or <b>half an olive-bulk the next day</b> and <b>half an olive-bulk outside</b> its designated area, the offering is <b>unfit but there is no</b> liability for <b><i>karet</i>.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that <b>this is the principle: If the intent</b> with regard to <b>the time preceded the intent</b> with regard to <b>the area,</b> the offering is <b><i>piggul</i> and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> on account of it. If the intent</b> with regard to <b>the area preceded the intent</b> with regard to <b>the time,</b> the offering is <b>unfit but there is no</b> liability for <b><i>karet</i>. And the Rabbis say:</b> In both <b>this</b> case, where the intent with regard to time was first, <b>and that</b> case, where the intent with regard to area came first, the offering is <b>unfit but there is no</b> liability for <b><i>karet</i>.</b>

### Part 8
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>According to the statement of the one who says</b> that if the <b>remainder</b> of a meal offering became <b>lacking between the removal of the handful and the burning</b> of the handful on the altar the priest nevertheless <b>burns the handful on</b> account of such a meal offering, <b>and</b> as <b>we maintain that</b> despite the fact that the handful is burned on account of it <b>that remainder is prohibited for consumption, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <i>piggul</i>? <b>Should</b> the <b>burning</b> of the handful <b>be effective in establishing</b> such a remainder <b>as <i>piggul</i></b> when the handful was burned with the intent to partake of the remainder the next day?

### Part 9
<b>And</b> similarly, is the burning of the handful effective <b>in removing</b> such a remainder <b>from</b> being subject to <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property, just as a complete remainder is removed being subject to this prohibition after the burning of the handful, when it becomes permitted to the priests for consumption?

### Part 10
<b>Rav Huna said: Even according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who says</b> that the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood of an offering, which renders its meat permitted for consumption and removes it from being subject to misuse of consecrated property, <b>is effective in</b> removing the meat of an offering that <b>left</b> the Temple courtyard from being subject to misuse of consecrated property despite the fact that such meat is prohibited for consumption, <b>that statement</b> applies only when the meat was disqualified by means of <b>leaving.</b>

### Part 11
Rav Huna explains: The reason is <b>that</b> the meat remains <b>as is, and</b> the <b>disqualification</b> of the meat by means of leaving is <b>on account of something else,</b> i.e., a factor external to the meat itself. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>a lack</b> in the measure of the remainder of a meal offering, <b>which is a disqualification</b> on account <b>of itself,</b> the <b>burning</b> of the handful <b>is not effective in</b> removing the remainder from being subject to misuse of consecrated property, nor to establish it as <i>piggul</i>.

### Part 12
<b>Rava said to</b> Rav Huna: <b>On the contrary; even according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who says</b> that <b>sprinkling is not effective in</b> removing the meat that <b>left</b> the Temple courtyard from being subject to misuse of consecrated property, <b>that statement</b> applies only when the meat was disqualified by means of <b>leaving, as</b> the meat <b>is not inside</b> the Temple courtyard where the sprinkling could be effective for it. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a lack</b> in the measure of the remainder of a meal offering <b>that is inside</b> the Temple courtyard, the <b>burning</b> of the handful <b>is effective</b> in removing the remainder from being subject to misuse of consecrated property as well as in establishing it as <i>piggul</i>.

### Part 13
<b>Rava said: From where do I say</b> that even remainders that lack a full measure can be rendered <i>piggul</i>? This can be inferred from that <b>which we learned</b> in the mishna: With regard to <b>one who removes a handful from the meal offering</b> with the intent <b>to partake</b> of <b>its remainder outside</b> the Temple courtyard <b>or</b> to partake of <b>an olive-bulk of its remainder outside</b> the Temple courtyard, the meal offering is unfit but there is no liability for <i>karet</i>, and if he removes a handful from the meal offering with the intent to partake of its remainder beyond the designated time or to partake of an olive-bulk of its remainder beyond the designated time the offering is <i>piggul</i> and one is liable to receive <i>karet</i> for partaking of the remainder of that meal offering. <b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches</b> in his version of the mishna: <b>One who removes a handful from the meal offering</b> with the intent to partake of its remainder, <b>and he does not teach: Or an olive-bulk</b> of its remainder.

### Part 14
Rava continues: <b>What is the reason</b> that Rabbi Ḥiyya diverged from the standard text of the mishna and <b>did not teach: Or an olive-bulk?</b> Is it <b>not</b> because his mishna is discussing a case <b>where</b> the <b>remainder</b> later <b>became lacking and</b> its measure <b>stood at an olive-bulk? And</b> therefore Rabbi Ḥiyya did not include the clause: Or an olive-bulk, <b>since</b> later in the mishna, <b>with regard to</b> the <b>placement</b> of the handful <b>in a vessel,</b> and <b>with regard to</b> the <b>conveyance</b> of the vessel to the altar, <b>and with regard to</b> the <b>burning</b> of the handful, <b>he</b> could <b>not teach</b> the phrase:
