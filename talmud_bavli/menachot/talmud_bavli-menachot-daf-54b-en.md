### Part 1
<b>When they disagree</b> is in a case <b>where</b> the food initially <b>had</b> the requisite <b>measure</b> for ritual impurity, <b>and it shrank</b> until it was less than this measure, <b>and</b> subsequently it <b>again swelled</b> to the requisite measure for contracting impurity. The dispute is <b>that</b> one <b>Sage,</b> i.e., Shmuel, Rabbi Shimon, and Reish Lakish, <b>holds: There is disqualification with regard to a ritual matter,</b> including impurity. In other words, if at a certain point the food was less than the requisite measure it becomes entirely disqualified from contracting ritual impurity, even if it subsequently swells again. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> i.e., Rav, Rav Ḥiyya, and Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>holds: There is no disqualification with regard to a ritual matter.</b> Even if at a certain stage the food lost its ability to contract impurity, if it later swells it can once again become impure.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>And is there one who says</b> that <b>there is disqualification with regard to ritual matters? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 3:6): In the case <b>of an egg-bulk</b> of a ritually impure <b>food that one placed in the sun and</b> that therefore <b>shrank</b> to less than an egg-bulk; <b>and similarly</b> in the case of <b>an olive-bulk</b> of flesh <b>of a corpse,</b> or <b>an olive-bulk of an animal carcass, or a lentil-bulk of a creeping animal,</b> all of which impart impurity; <b>or an olive-bulk</b> of <b><i>piggul</i>, or an olive-bulk</b> of <b><i>notar</i>, or an olive-bulk</b> of forbidden <b>fat,</b> if any of these were placed in the sun and shrank, they <b>are pure,</b> i.e., they do not impart impurity to other items, <b>and one is not liable</b> to receive <i>karet</i> <b>for them due to</b> the prohibitions of <b><i>piggul</i>, <i>notar</i>, or</b> forbidden <b>fat.</b>

### Part 3
The mishna continues: If, after they shrank in the sun, one took these foods and <b>placed them in the rain,</b> as a result of which <b>they</b> again <b>swelled</b> to the minimum volume for ritual impurity, <b>they are impure,</b> as was the case before they shrank. This applies to the impurity of a corpse, the impurity of an animal carcass, and the impurity of foods, <b>and one is</b> also <b>liable</b> to receive <i>karet</i> <b>for them due to <i>piggul</i>, <i>notar</i>, or</b> forbidden <b>fat.</b> This demonstrates that the food is not permanently disqualified. Therefore, <b>the refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>the one who says</b> that <b>there is disqualification with regard to ritual matters</b> is <b>a conclusive refutation.</b>

### Part 4
§ The Gemara returns to the dispute over whether food is to be measured in its current volume or according to its initial volume. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i>: (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Terumot</i> 4:2): <b>One may separate <i>teruma</i></b> and tithes from fresh <b>figs for dried figs,</b> which have shrunk and are now smaller than they were when they were fresh. In other words, one may designate fresh figs as <i>teruma</i> and tithe to exempt the dried figs, despite the difference between these two types of figs. This separation may be performed only <b>by number,</b> e.g., ten fresh figs for ninety dried figs. One may not set aside this <i>teruma</i> by volume, i.e., by separating fresh figs with a volume of one-tenth of the measure of dried figs. The reason is that the volume of the fresh figs is greater than that of the dried figs, so he would set aside fewer fresh figs than he would if he calculated by number.

### Part 5
The Gemara analyzes this <i>halakha</i>. <b>Granted, if you say</b> that <b>one measures</b> food items <b>as they were</b> initially, then since when the obligation to separate <i>teruma</i> began, the volume of the dried figs was the same as the fresh ones, then it is <b>well;</b> the amount of figs to be separated as <i>teruma</i> should be calculated based on number, disregarding their current volume. <b>But if you say</b> that foods are to be measured <b>as they</b> currently <b>are,</b> then since the volume of the dried figs is smaller than that of the fresh figs, he will separate a larger amount than necessary, and <b>this</b> case is an example of one who <b>increases</b> his <b>tithes.</b>

### Part 6
<b>And we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Demai</i> 8:10): In the case of <b>one who increases</b> his <b>tithes,</b> i.e., he designates more than one-tenth of the produce as tithe, the remainder of <b>his produce is rendered fit</b> for consumption, as it has been properly tithed. <b>But his tithes are ruined,</b> as the amount over one-tenth is not tithe, and it was not itself tithed, so it remains untithed produce. If so, how can the fresh figs be considered proper <i>teruma</i> and tithes in this case?

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>Rather, what</b> will you claim; that one measures foods <b>as they were</b> initially? If so, <b>say the latter clause</b> of that same <i>baraita</i>: One may separate tithes from <b>dried figs for</b> fresh <b>figs</b> only <b>by measure</b> of volume, i.e., dried figs that are one-tenth of the volume of the fresh figs. One may not separate by number, as this would result in fewer dried figs than separation by volume.

### Part 8
The Gemara analyzes this <i>halakha</i>. <b>Granted, if you say</b> that one measures foods <b>as they are</b> currently, it is <b>well. But if you say</b> that one measures foods <b>as they were</b> initially, when the dried figs were fresh, it should be enough to set aside a smaller number of dried figs corresponding to the fresh ones. Since the <i>baraita</i> instructs him to separate a larger number of dried figs than required, this too <b>is</b> an example of <b>one who increases</b> his <b>tithes.</b>

### Part 9
Therefore, this <i>baraita</i> cannot serve as proof for either opinion. Since the two statements of the <i>baraita</i> appear contradictory, it must be that this <i>baraita</i> is actually not discussing tithes, which must be separated according to a precise measure. <b>Rather, here we are dealing with standard <i>teruma</i>.</b> By Torah law there is no fixed measure for standard <i>teruma</i>; a single kernel of grain exempts the entire crop. The Sages established a range of measures: One-fortieth for a generous gift, one-fiftieth for an average gift, and one-sixtieth for a miserly gift. Accordingly, one who wishes to give generously should give slightly more than the exact measure. <b>And</b> therefore, <b>the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> is speaking of one who wishes to separate <i>teruma</i> <b>generously, and</b> in <b>the latter clause,</b> where he also gives more than necessary, <b>it</b> is also referring to one who wishes to separate his <i>teruma</i> <b>generously.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara challenges: <b>If so, say the last clause: Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei, said: Father,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yosei, <b>would set aside ten dried figs that</b> were <b>in a vessel for ninety</b> fresh figs <b>that</b> were <b>in a basket. And if</b> this <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>standard <i>teruma</i>,</b> then with regard to this mention of <b>ten</b> dried figs, <b>what is its purpose?</b> This proportion was greater by orders of magnitude than even the amount of a generous gift established by the Sages.

### Part 11
<b>Rather, here we are dealing with <i>teruma</i> of the tithe,</b> which the Levite separates from his tithe and gives to a priest. This <i>teruma</i> is one-tenth of the first tithe. <b>And</b> this ruling <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Abba Elazar ben Gomel. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Abba Elazar ben Gomel says</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“And your <i>teruma</i> [<i>terumatkhem</i>] shall be reckoned to you</b> as though it were the grain of the threshing floor” (Numbers 18:27), that in using a plural term of the word “your,” <b>the verse speaks about two <i>terumot</i>. One is standard <i>teruma</i>,</b> i.e., the grain of the threshing floor, <b>and</b> the other <b>one is <i>teruma</i> of the tithe.</b> The verse equates these two <i>terumot</i>.

### Part 12
Abba Elazar ben Gomel explains: <b>Just as standard <i>teruma</i> is taken by estimate,</b> as there is no requirement for the amount separated to be measured precisely; <b>and</b> it can be taken <b>by thought,</b> as one is not required to physically separate it before consuming the remaining produce, <b>so too, <i>teruma</i> of the tithe may be taken by estimate</b>
