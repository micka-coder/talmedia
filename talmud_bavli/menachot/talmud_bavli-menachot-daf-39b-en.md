### Part 1
<b>and</b> the ritual fringes were composed <b>entirely</b> of <b>windings,</b> without any portion of the strings hanging loose. <b>Rav said: The cloak is beautiful, but the</b> white and <b>sky-blue</b> strings are <b>not beautiful. Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: The cloak is beautiful, and the</b> white and <b>sky-blue</b> strings are also <b>beautiful.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do they disagree?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana holds</b> that since <b>it is written</b> in one verse: “You shall prepare yourself <b>twisted cords”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:12), <b>and</b> in another <b>it is written:</b> “And they shall put on the fringe of the corner a sky-blue <b>thread”</b> (Numbers 15:38), it teaches that the ritual fringes may be composed entirely of <b>either twisted cords,</b> i.e., the windings, <b>or</b> loose threads or <b>strings.</b>

### Part 3
<b>And Rav holds</b> that <b>actually, we</b> also <b>require</b> loose <b>strings</b> in addition to the windings, <b>and</b> when <b>that</b> term <b>“twisted cords”</b> appears in the verse, <b>it comes for</b> the purpose of teaching the <b>number</b> of strings that are required. If the verse would have employed the singular term <b>twisted cord,</b> it would still indicate that <b>two</b> strings are required, as twisted means that two strings are wound around each other. Once the verse uses the plural term <b>“twisted cords,”</b> it thereby indicates that <b>four</b> strings are required. By using the terms “twisted cords” and “thread,” the verses indicates: <b>Form twisted cords</b> with the four strings that one attaches to each corner, <b>and let</b> the strings <b>hang loose from them.</b>

### Part 4
§ <b>Shmuel says in the name of Levi: Wool strings exempt</b> a garment made <b>of linen,</b> i.e., one fulfills the mitzva by affixing wool strings to a linen garment.

### Part 5
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to whether strings made <b>of linen exempt</b> a garment made <b>of wool?</b> One can say that <b>it is</b> only <b>wool</b> strings <b>that exempt</b> a garment <b>of linen, as since the sky-blue</b> string, which must be wool, <b>exempts</b> a linen garment, <b>white</b> strings of wool <b>also exempt</b> the garment. <b>But</b> if one affixes <b>linen</b> strings <b>to a wool</b> garment, he does <b>not</b> fulfill his obligation.

### Part 6
<b>Or perhaps, since it is written: “You shall not wear diverse kinds, wool and linen together. You shall prepare yourself twisted cords</b> upon the four corners of your covering” (Deuteronomy 22:11–12), which indicates that one may wear wool and linen together in order to fulfill the mitzva of ritual fringes, there <b>is no difference</b> whether one affixes <b>wool</b> strings <b>to</b> a garment of <b>linen, and</b> there <b>is no difference</b> whether one affixes <b>linen</b> strings <b>to</b> a garment of <b>wool.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to this dilemma, <b>as Raḥava says</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda says: Wool strings exempt</b> a garment made <b>of linen,</b> strings <b>of linen exempt</b> a garment made <b>of wool,</b> and <b>strings of wool and linen exempt</b> a garment <b>in any case,</b> i.e., all garments, <b>and even</b> garments made <b>from silks [<i>beshira’in</i>].</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> this last point <b>disagrees</b> with a ruling <b>of Rav Naḥman, as Rav Naḥman says: <i>Shira’in</i> are</b> entirely <b>exempt from</b> the obligation of <b>ritual fringes. Rava raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: Garments made from types of silks known as <b><i>shira’in</i>, <i>kalakh</i>, and <i>serikin</i> all require ritual fringes.</b> The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> means that there is an obligation <b>by rabbinic law,</b> whereas Rav Naḥman meant they are exempt by Torah law.

### Part 9
The Gemara challenges this suggestion: <b>If that is so,</b> then <b>say the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all of these</b> garments, strings of <b>wool and linen exempt them.</b> This indicates that one may affix wool sky-blue strings and white linen strings. <b>Granted, if you say</b> that the obligation of ritual fringes for silk garments is <b>by Torah law, that is</b> why <b>diverse kinds are permitted for them. But if you say</b> that the obligation is <b>by rabbinic law, how could diverse kinds be permitted for them?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> instead: <b>Either wool or linen</b> strings exempt silk garments, but one may not affix both wool and linen strings to the same silk garment.

### Part 10
The Gemara comments: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> to assume that this is the correct interpretation of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>as</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> in <b>the latter clause:</b> Strings made from <b>these</b> silk fabrics <b>exempt</b> a garment <b>of their type</b> but <b>do not exempt</b> a garment <b>that is not of their type. Granted, if you say</b> that the obligation to attach ritual fringes to these garments is <b>by rabbinic law, that is</b> why <b>they are exempted</b> if one affixes strings <b>of their type. But if you say</b> that the obligation is <b>by Torah law,</b> then <b>it</b> should be only <b>wool or linen that exempt</b> these garments.

### Part 11
The Gemara rejects this: <b>If</b> it is <b>due to that</b> reason, <b>there is no</b> conclusive <b>argument,</b> because one can maintain that other fabrics also fulfill the obligation of ritual fringes by Torah law, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava. As Rava raises a contradiction: It is written</b> in one verse: “And they shall put on the fringe of the corner a sky-blue thread” (Numbers 15:38). The term <b>“the corner”</b> indicates that the fringe must be from the same <b>type</b> of fabric as the <b>corner. And</b> yet <b>it is written: “Wool and linen”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:11), immediately before the verse states: “You shall prepare yourself twisted cords upon the four corners of your covering” (Deuteronomy 22:12), indicating that ritual fringes must be from either wool or linen.

### Part 12
<b>How so?</b> Strings made of <b>wool or linen exempt</b> any garment, <b>whether</b> the garment is made <b>of their type</b> of fabric, or <b>whether</b> it is <b>not of their type</b> of fabric. Strings made of all <b>other types</b> of fabric <b>exempt</b> garments made <b>of their type</b> of fabric, e.g., silk strings exempt a silk garment, but <b>they do not exempt</b> a garment made from a fabric <b>that is not their type,</b> i.e., a garment made from a different fabric.

### Part 13
The Gemara notes: <b>And Rav Naḥman,</b> who holds that silk garments do not require ritual fringes by Torah law, holds <b>in accordance with</b> the ruling stated by <b>a <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael.</b>

### Part 14
<b>As</b> a <i>tanna</i> <b>of the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Since</b> the word <b>garments is</b> usually <b>stated in the Torah without specification</b> as to the material from which the garments are made, <b>and the verse specified in one of</b> its references to garments that it is referring to garments made from <b>wool or linen,</b> as it states: “And the garment in which there will be the mark of leprosy, whether it be a woolen garment or a linen garment” (Leviticus 13:47), it may be derived that <b>so too, all</b> garments mentioned in the Torah are those made from <b>wool or linen.</b> Other fabrics are not classified as garments by Torah law. Consequently, when the Torah requires strings on the corners of garments (see Numbers 15:38), it is referring specifically to garments made of wool or linen.

### Part 15
<b>Abaye said: This</b> statement by <b>a <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael diverges from another</b> statement by <b>a <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael,</b> who holds that all fabrics are considered garments. <b>As</b> a <i>tanna</i> <b>of the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> From the fact that the verse states: “A woolen <b>garment”</b> (Leviticus 13:47), <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>a garment of wool</b> can become ritually impure. <b>From where</b> is it derived that garments made of <b>camels’ hair, rabbits’ wool, goats’ hair, or</b> the types of silk <b><i>kalakh</i>, <i>serikin</i>, and <i>shirayin</i>,</b> are also <b>included</b> in this <i>halakha</i>? <b>The</b> same <b>verse states: “Or</b> a linen <b>garment.”</b> The word “or” serves as an amplification to include all types of fabric.
