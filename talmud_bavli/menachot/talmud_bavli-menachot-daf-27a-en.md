### Part 1
<b>as “upon [<i>al</i>]</b> the wood” <b>is written,</b> and not: Next to the wood.

### Part 2
<b>When should you raise the dilemma?</b> Raise it <b>according to</b> the opinion <b>of the one who says</b> in the mishna (96a) that the term <b>“upon [<i>al</i>]”</b> (see Numbers 2:20) means <b>adjacent to.</b> According to that <i>tanna</i>, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in this case? Is it explained that <b>here, too,</b> the phrase <b>“upon [<i>al</i>]</b> the wood” can mean <b>adjacent to</b> the wood? <b>Or perhaps,</b> the phrase “upon [<i>al</i>] the wood that is on the fire upon the altar” teaches that <b>“upon the wood”</b> is to be understood as <b>similar to “upon the altar”: Just as there “upon</b> the altar” is meant <b>literally, so too here,</b> the phrase <b>“upon</b> the wood” is meant <b>literally.</b> The Gemara comments: No answer was found, and the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 3
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>the handful,</b> failure to sacrifice <b>the minority of it prevents the majority of it,</b> which was sacrificed, from rendering it permitted for the priests to consume the remainder of the meal offering. With regard to <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah of flour brought as a meal offering, failure to sacrifice <b>the minority of it prevents the majority of it,</b> which was sacrificed, from qualifying as a proper meal offering. With regard to <b>the wine</b> poured as a libation, failure to pour <b>the minority of it prevents the majority of it,</b> which was poured, from qualifying as a proper libation. With regard to <b>the</b> <i>log</i> of <b>oil</b> that is required for the meal offering, failure to add <b>the minority of it prevents the majority of it,</b> which was added, from being a sufficient measure of oil.

### Part 4
With regard to <b>the fine flour and the oil,</b> failure to bring <b>each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other.</b> With regard to <b>the handful and the frankincense,</b> failure to burn <b>each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other.</b>

### Part 5
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What is the reason</b> that the failure to sacrifice the minority of the handful disqualifies the entire offering? This is derived from the fact that <b>the verse states “his handful” twice,</b> once with regard to the voluntary meal offering (Leviticus 2:2) and once with regard to the meal offering of a sinner (Leviticus 5:12), and any <i>halakha</i> repeated in the verses is deemed indispensable.

### Part 6
The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah of flour brought as a meal offering, failure to sacrifice <b>the minority of it prevents the majority of it</b> from qualifying as a proper meal offering. <b>What is the reason? The verse states:</b> “The priest shall remove of it a handful <b>of its fine flour”</b> (Leviticus 2:2). The usage of the term “of its fine flour” instead of: Of the fine flour, teaches <b>that if any amount</b> of its flour <b>was missing,</b> it is <b>not valid.</b>

### Part 7
The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>the wine</b> poured as a libation, failure to pour <b>the minority of it prevents the majority of it</b> from qualifying as a proper libation. What is the reason? The verse states concerning the libations: <b>“So</b> shall it be done” (Numbers 15:11). The term “so” indicates that the libations must be sacrificed exactly in the manner described, without any deviation.

### Part 8
The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>the</b> <i>log</i> of <b>oil</b> that is required for the meal offering, failure to add <b>the minority of it prevents the majority of it</b> from being a sufficient measure of oil. In the case of the oil <b>of the meal offering</b> that accompanies the <b>libations,</b> this <i>halakha</i> is learned from the term: <b>“So”</b> (Numbers 15:11), stated with regard to the libations. <b>And</b> in the case of the <i>log</i> of oil that accompanies <b>a voluntary meal offering, the verse states: “And of its oil”</b> (Leviticus 2:2), demonstrating <b>that if any amount</b> of its oil was <b>missing,</b> it is <b>not valid.</b>

### Part 9
The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>the fine flour and the oil,</b> failure to bring <b>each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other.</b> The <i>halakha</i> that each is indispensable is derived from the fact that the two are juxtaposed in the verse: “The priest shall remove of it a handful <b>of its fine flour and of its oil”</b> (Leviticus 2:2), and the fact that this requirement is repeated in the verse: <b>“Of its groats, and of its oil”</b> (Leviticus 2:16), teaches that each is indispensable.

### Part 10
The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>the handful and the frankincense,</b> failure to burn <b>each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other.</b> The <i>halakha</i> that each is indispensable is derived from the repetition of the mention of the two together in the verse, as it is written: “The priest shall remove of it a handful of its fine flour and of its oil, <b>as well as all of its frankincense”</b> (Leviticus 2:2), and again with regard to the meal offering of a sinner it is stated: <b>“And all the frankincense which is upon the meal offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:8).

### Part 11
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>the two goats of Yom Kippur,</b> the absence of <b>each</b> goat <b>prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other.</b> With regard to <b>the two sheep</b> brought together with the meal offering of the two loaves on <b><i>Shavuot</i>,</b> failure to bring <b>each</b> of the sheep <b>prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other.</b> With regard to the <b>two loaves</b> brought on <i>Shavuot</i>, failure to bring <b>each</b> of the loaves <b>prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other.</b>

### Part 12
With regard to the <b>two arrangements</b> of the shewbread, failure to place <b>each</b> of the arrangements <b>prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other.</b> With regard to the <b>two bowls</b> of frankincense that accompany the shewbread, failure to place <b>each</b> of the bowls <b>prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other.</b> With regard to <b>the arrangements</b> of the shewbread <b>and the bowls</b> of frankincense, failure to bring <b>each</b> of them <b>prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other.</b>

### Part 13
With regard to the <b>two types</b> of loaves <b>that</b> accompany the offerings <b>of a nazirite:</b> The bread and wafers (see Numbers 6:15); the <b>three</b> species <b>that</b> are part of the rite <b>of the</b> red <b>heifer:</b> The cedar, hyssop, and scarlet wool (see Numbers 19:6); <b>and</b> the <b>four</b> types of loaves <b>that</b> accompany <b>the thanks offering:</b> The loaves, wafers, loaves soaked in hot water, and leavened bread (see Leviticus 7:12); <b>and</b> the <b>four</b> species <b>of the <i>lulav</i>:</b> The <i>lulav</i>, <i>etrog</i>, myrtle, and willow (see Leviticus 23:40); <b>and</b> the <b>four</b> species <b>that are</b> used <b>in</b> the purification process of <b>the leper:</b> The cedar, hyssop, scarlet wool, and birds (see Leviticus 14:4), failure to bring <b>each</b> of the components <b>prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others.</b>

### Part 14
With regard to the <b>seven sprinklings</b> of the blood <b>of the</b> red <b>heifer</b> that the priest sprinkles opposite the entrance to the Sanctuary (see Numbers 19:4), failure to sprinkle <b>each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others.</b> With regard to the <b>seven sprinklings</b> of the blood of the bull and goat of Yom Kippur <b>that</b> are sprinkled <b>on</b> the Ark <b>between the staves</b> (see Leviticus 16:14–15), the seven sprinklings <b>that</b> are sprinkled <b>on the Curtain</b> separating the Sanctuary and Holy of Holies, and the sprinklings <b>that</b> are sprinkled <b>on the golden altar</b> on Yom Kippur, and from all other inner sin offerings, failure to sprinkle <b>each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others.</b>

### Part 15
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>the two goats of Yom Kippur,</b> the absence of <b>each</b> goat <b>prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other.</b> This is derived from the verse that states with regard to the Yom Kippur service: “And it shall be <b>a statute</b> forever” (Leviticus 16:29), since wherever the term “statute” appears concerning a sacrificial rite, it signifies that the rite is an indispensable requirement.

### Part 16
The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>the two sheep</b> brought together with the meal offering of the two loaves on <b><i>Shavuot</i>,</b> failure to bring <b>each</b> of the sheep <b>prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other.</b> This is derived from the verse: “They shall be holy” (Leviticus 23:20), since the employment of a term of <b>being</b> indicates an indispensable requirement. Similarly, with regard to the <b>two loaves</b> brought on <i>Shavuot</i>, the reason failure to bring each of the loaves prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other is that the verse states: “They shall be of fine flour” (Leviticus 23:17), employing a term of <b>being.</b>

### Part 17
With regard to the <b>two arrangements</b> of the shewbread, the reason failure to place each of the arrangements prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other is that the verse employs the term <b>statute</b> concerning them (see Leviticus 24:9). With regard to the <b>two bowls</b> of frankincense that accompany the shewbread, the reason failure to place each of the bowls prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other is that the verse employs the term <b>statute</b> concerning them (see Leviticus 24:9). With regard to <b>the arrangements</b> of the shewbread <b>and the bowls</b> of frankincense, the reason failure to bring each of them prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the other is that the verse employs the term <b>statute</b> concerning them, as that verse addresses each of these two components.

### Part 18
With regard to the <b>two types</b> of loaves <b>that</b> accompany the offerings <b>of a nazirite,</b> each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to the nazirite: <b>“So he must do</b> after the law of his naziriteship” (Numbers 6:21), demonstrating that must bring his offerings precisely as detailed in the verse. With regard to the <b>three</b> species <b>that</b> are part of the rite <b>of the</b> red <b>heifer,</b> each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others, since the term <b>statute</b> is written about them: “This is the statute of the law” (Numbers 19:2).

### Part 19
With regard to the <b>four</b> types of loaves <b>that</b> accompany <b>the thanks offering,</b> each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others, <b>since</b> the thanks offering <b>is juxtaposed to</b> the offerings of <b>a nazirite, as it is written</b> with regard to the thanks offering: <b>“With the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving”</b> (Leviticus 7:13). <b>And the Master said:</b> The term <b>“his peace offerings”</b> serves <b>to include</b> the loaves of <b>the peace offering of a nazirite,</b> and it has already been demonstrated that with regard to the loaves that accompany the offerings of a nazirite, each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others.

### Part 20
<b>And</b> with regard to the <b>four</b> species <b>that are in</b> the purification process of <b>the leper,</b> each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others, <b>as it is written: “This shall be the law of the leper”</b> (Leviticus 14:2), and the term “shall be” indicates an indispensable requirement. <b>And</b> with regard to the <b>four</b> species <b>of the <i>lulav</i>,</b> each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others, as the verse states: <b>“And you shall take” [<i>ulkaḥtem</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 23:40), which alludes to: <b>A complete taking [<i>lekiḥa tamma</i>],</b> comprising all four species.

### Part 21
§ <b>Rav Ḥanan bar Rava says:</b> The mishna <b>taught</b> that the four species of the <i>lulav</i> are necessary for the fulfillment of the mitzva <b>only</b> in a case <b>where one did not have</b> all four species; <b>but</b> if <b>one has</b> all four species, failure to take each of the components <b>does not prevent</b> fulfillment of the mitzva with the others, and he fulfills the mitzva by taking each species individually.

### Part 22
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the <b>four species of the <i>lulav</i>, two of them,</b> the <i>lulav</i> and <i>etrog</i>, <b>produce fruit, and two of them,</b> the myrtle and willow, <b>do not produce fruit. Those that produce fruit have a bond with those that do not produce fruit, and those that do not produce fruit have a bond with those that produce fruit. And a person does not fulfill his obligation</b> of taking the <i>lulav</i> <b>until they are all</b> bound together <b>in a single bundle.</b>

### Part 23
<b>And so too,</b> when <b>the Jewish people</b> fast and pray <b>for acceptance</b> of their repentance, this is not accomplished <b>until they are all</b> bound together <b>in a single bundle, as it is stated: “It is He that builds His upper chambers in the Heaven, and has established His bundle upon the earth”</b> (Amos 9:6), which is interpreted as stating that only when the Jewish people are bound together are they established upon the earth. This <i>baraita</i> contradicts Rav Ḥanan bar Rava’s statement, since it teaches that the four species of the <i>lulav</i> must be taken together in order for one to fulfill his obligation of taking the <i>lulav</i>.

### Part 24
The Gemara answers: Whether the different species must be taken together <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>; as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A <i>lulav</i>, whether</b> it is <b>bound</b> with the myrtle and willow or <b>whether</b> it is <b>not bound,</b> is <b>fit. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If it is <b>bound,</b> it is <b>fit;</b> if it is <b>not bound,</b> it is <b>unfit.</b>

### Part 25
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> The Gemara answers: By means of a verbal analogy, he <b>derives</b> the term <b>taking,</b> written with regard to the four species, <b>from</b> the term <b>taking</b> written with regard to <b>the bundle of hyssop.</b> It is written there, in the context of the sacrifice of the Paschal offering in Egypt: “Take a bundle of hyssop” (Exodus 12:22), and it is written here, with regard to the four species: “And you shall take for you on the first day the fruit of a beautiful tree, branches of a date palm, boughs of dense-leaved trees, and willows of the brook” (Leviticus 23:40).

### Part 26
<b>Just as there,</b> with regard to the Paschal offering, the mitzva to take the hyssop is specifically <b>in a bundle, so too here,</b> the mitzva to take the four species is specifically <b>in a bundle.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what is the reasoning of <b>the Rabbis?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>They do not derive</b> the meaning of the term <b>taking</b> from the meaning of the term <b>taking</b> by means of the verbal analogy.

### Part 27
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There is <b>a mitzva to bind</b> the myrtle and the willow together with the <b><i>lulav</i>, but if one did not bind it,</b> it is <b>fit? In accordance with whose</b> opinion is the <i>baraita</i>? <b>If</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> if <b>one did not bind it, why</b> is it <b>fit? If</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, what mitzva</b> is one fulfilling by binding it?

### Part 28
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. And what mitzva</b> is one fulfilling? The mitzva is <b>due to</b> the fact that it is stated: <b>“This is my God and I will beautify Him”</b> (Exodus 15:2), which is interpreted to mean that one should beautify himself before God in the performance of the mitzvot. The Rabbis agree that although failure to bind the three species does not render them unfit for performing the mitzva, the performance of the mitzva is more beautiful when the <i>lulav</i> is bound.

### Part 29
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to the <b>seven sprinklings</b> of the blood <b>of the heifer</b> that the priest sprinkles opposite the entrance to the Sanctuary, failure to sprinkle <b>each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others,</b> since the term <b>statute</b> is written about them (see Numbers 19:2).

### Part 30
The mishna further teaches: With regard to the <b>seven sprinklings</b> of the blood of the bull and goat of Yom Kippur <b>that</b> are sprinkled <b>on</b> the Ark <b>between the staves, and</b> the sprinklings <b>that</b> are sprinkled <b>on the golden altar</b> on Yom Kippur, and the sprinklings from all other inner sin offerings that are sprinkled on the golden altar, <b>and</b> the seven sprinklings <b>that</b> are sprinkled <b>on the Curtain</b> separating the Sanctuary and Holy of Holies, failure to sprinkle <b>each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others.</b> With regard to the sprinklings <b>of Yom Kippur,</b> the reason that each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others is that the term <b>“statute” is written</b> about the Yom Kippur service (see Leviticus 16:29).

### Part 31
With regard to the sprinklings <b>of the bull of</b> the <b>anointed priest,</b> i.e., the High Priest, <b>and of the bull for an unwitting communal sin, and</b> those <b>of the goats of idol worship,</b> which are sprinkled on the Curtain and on the golden altar, the reason that each prevents fulfillment of the mitzva with the others is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the bull for an unwitting communal sin: <b>“So shall he do with the bull; as he did with the bull</b> of the sin offering” of the anointed priest (Leviticus 4:20). <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> that the bull offering for an unwitting communal sin is sacrificed in the same manner as the bull of the anointed priest, when the Torah has already explicitly specified the manner in which the service should take place? The reason it states it is in order <b>to repeat</b> the command <b>of the sprinklings,</b>
