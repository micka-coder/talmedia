### Part 1
<b>I do not raise the dilemma. When I raise the dilemma,</b> it is with regard to the <b>prohibition of: “Shall be offered in its entirety;</b> it shall not be eaten.” <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Is this prohibition applicable only to the meal offering of a priest mentioned in the verse, or does it apply to a priest who eats from the sacrificial portions as well?

### Part 2
<b>Rav Aharon said to Ravina: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an answer to this question from that <b>which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> With regard to <b>every</b> sacrificial item, not just the meal offering of a priest, such as the sacrificial portions, <b>which is</b> included <b>in</b> the category of <b>“shall be offered in its entirety”</b> that requires it to be burned, the verse serves <b>to impose a prohibition against eating it.</b>

### Part 3
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The meal offering of priests, the meal offering of the anointed priest,</b> i.e., the High Priest, <b>and the meal offering</b> brought with <b>libations</b> that accompany burnt offerings and peace offerings are burned in their entirety <b>on the altar, and there is no</b> part <b>of them for the priests. And in</b> the case of those offerings, <b>the power of the altar is greater than the power of the priests. The two loaves,</b> i.e., the public offering on Shavuot of two loaves baked from new wheat, <b>and the shewbread,</b> i.e., the twelve loaves that were placed on the sacred Table in the Sanctuary each Shabbat, <b>are eaten by the priests, and there is no part of them</b> burned <b>on the altar. And in</b> the case of those offerings, <b>the power of the priests is greater than the power of the altar.</b>

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>And are there no additional</b> cases of sacrificial items that are completely placed on the altar, with none of their parts given to the priests? <b>But isn’t there the burnt offering,</b> which is completely burned on the altar? The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> the burnt offering’s <b>hide,</b> which is given <b>to the priests.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t there the bird</b> sacrificed as <b>a burnt offering,</b> whose skin is not given to the priests? The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> the bird burnt offering’s <b>crop and its feathers,</b> which are not burned upon the altar. The Gemara asks: <b>But aren’t there</b> wine <b>libations,</b> which are completely poured onto the altar? The Gemara answers: The libations <b>go to the drainpipes,</b> and pouring the wine into the drainpipes is not considered placing it upon the altar.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>And what</b> is meant when the mishna emphasizes: <b>And in</b> the case of those offerings, the power of the altar is greater than the power of the priests, indicating that there are other items that one might have thought are burned entirely on the altar as well? The Gemara answers: The mishna’s wording serves <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel, as Shmuel said: One who donates wine brings it and pours it over the fires</b> of the altar, such that it is offered in the manner of an animal offering and not as a libation. Therefore, the mishna’s wording <b>teaches us that</b> wine donated in this manner <b>goes to the drainpipes,</b> unlike according to the opinion of Shmuel that it is entirely burned.

### Part 6
The Gemara adds: With regard to another ruling, the mishna <b>supports</b> a different statement <b>of Shmuel. As Shmuel said: One who donates oil</b> to the Temple <b>removes a handful</b> and sacrifices it on the altar, <b>and its remainder is eaten</b> by the priests. Shmuel’s ruling is in accordance with the mishna, which does not list a donation of oil as one of the offerings given completely to the altar.

### Part 7
§ According to the mishna, with regard to <b>the two loaves and the shewbread,</b> the power of the priests is greater than the power of the altar. The Gemara asks: <b>And are there no more</b> cases of sacrificial items that are given completely to the priests, with none of their parts placed upon the altar? <b>But isn’t there the bird</b> sacrificed as a <b>sin offering,</b> which is eaten entirely by the priests, and none of it is placed upon the altar? The Gemara answers: <b>There is its blood,</b> which is sprinkled upon the altar.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t there</b> the <b><i>log</i> of oil of a leper</b> that he brings on the day that he becomes ritually clean, which is given completely to the priests? The Gemara answers: It is not given completely to the priests, as <b>there are its placements,</b> when oil is sprinkled seven times “before the Lord” (Leviticus 14:16), and applied to the leper’s right ear, thumb, and big toe (see Leviticus 14:17).

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>And what</b> is meant when the mishna emphasizes: <b>And in</b> the case of those offerings, the power of the priests is greater than the power of the altar? The Gemara answers: This wording serves <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of the one who says: The two loaves that are brought by themselves,</b> unaccompanied by the requisite two lambs, may not be offered, and instead of being eaten <b>they go to be burned.</b> By emphasizing that the two loaves and the shewbread are eaten by the priests and not placed on the altar, the mishna <b>teaches us that in this</b> case, <b>the power of the priests is always greater,</b> even if the two lambs are not offered with the two loaves.

### Part 10
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>All the meal offerings that are prepared in a vessel,</b> e.g., the offerings prepared in a pan or deep pan, <b>require three placements of oil,</b> listed here in the reverse order of their placement: <b>Pouring</b> oil on the cakes after they have been cooked, <b>and mixing</b> oil into the flour, <b>and placement of oil into the vessel prior to preparation</b> of the meal offerings.

### Part 11
In the meal offerings that come as loaves, it is after the flour has been baked into <b>loaves</b> that one breaks them into pieces and <b>mixes them</b> with oil; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> It is with <b>fine flour</b> that one mixes the oil. Although <b>the loaves</b> of the meal offering baked in an oven <b>require mixing</b> of their flour with oil, <b>wafers</b> do not require mixing, but rather a <b>smearing</b> of oil on them after baking. <b>How does one smear</b> oil on <b>them?</b> He does so in a shape <b>similar</b> to the Greek letter <b>chi,</b> Χ, <b>and the rest</b> of the oil remaining after smearing is <b>eaten by priests.</b>

### Part 12
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the statement of the mishna that all the meal offerings prepared in a vessel require three placements of oil, the Gemara asks: <b>To exclude what</b> does the mishna specify: Meal offerings prepared in a vessel? <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> The mishna serves <b>to exclude</b> the oven-<b>baked meal offering,</b> whose preparation does not require the use of a service vessel, as it is merely baked in an oven. Such a meal offering does not require the pouring of the oil.

### Part 13
With regard to the three placements of oil in a pan meal offering and a deep-pan meal offering, <b>the Sages taught</b> that the verse states: <b>“And if your offering is a deep-pan meal offering, it shall be made of fine flour in oil”</b> (Leviticus 2:7). This <b>teaches that it requires</b> the <b>placement of oil in</b> an empty <b>vessel,</b> and the flour is added afterward. In addition, the term <b>“your offering”</b> in this verse and the term <b>“your offering”</b> (Leviticus 2:5), written with regard to the meal offering prepared in a pan, are understood <b>to</b> teach <b>a verbal analogy:</b>
