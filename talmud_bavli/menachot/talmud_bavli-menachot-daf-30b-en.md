### Part 1
<b>Rather,</b> he should write <b>three</b> letters <b>in the column and two outside of the column.</b> If <b>he happens</b> upon <b>a word that comprises two letters</b> and cannot be written in its entirety within the column, <b>he may not cast it</b> in the margin <b>between the</b> two <b>columns; rather, he should return and write</b> the word <b>at the beginning of the</b> following <b>line.</b>

### Part 2
§ <b>One who mistakenly</b> omitted <b>the name</b> of God and wrote the next word before discovering his error should <b>scrape off that which he wrote, and suspend</b> the words <b>that he scraped off</b> above the line, <b>and write the name</b> of God <b>upon the place that had been scraped;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei says: One may even suspend the name</b> of God above the line, without scraping off the word that was written in its place. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says:</b> Not only may one scrape off the dry ink of the next word, but one may <b>even wipe away</b> the word while the ink is still wet <b>and write</b> the name of God in its place.

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri says:</b> A scribe <b>may suspend the entire name</b> of God above the line, but he <b>may not suspend part of</b> the name of God above the line. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says in the name of Rabbi Meir:</b> A scribe <b>may not write the name</b> of God <b>either upon the place that had been scraped or upon the place that had been wiped away, and</b> he <b>may not suspend it</b> above the line, as none of these options exhibit sufficient respect for the name of God. <b>What should</b> the scribe <b>do? He should remove the entire sheet</b> of parchment <b>and inter it.</b>

### Part 4
<b>It was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disagreed with regard to the final halakhic ruling: <b>Rav Ḥananel says</b> that <b>Rav</b> says: The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that one <b>suspends the name</b> of God above the line. <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Shmuel</b> says: The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that one may even <b>wipe away</b> the word while the ink is still wet <b>and write</b> the name of God in its place.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> why is it necessary to state the actual opinions? <b>Let</b> this <b>Sage,</b> Rav Ḥananel in the name of Rav, <b>say</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of this <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yosei; <b>and</b> let this <b>Sage,</b> Rabba bar bar Ḥana in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Shmuel, say that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of that <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak. The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> there are those <b>who reverse</b> the opinions of the <i>tanna’im</i>, they needed to state the opinions explicitly.

### Part 6
<b>Ravin bar Ḥinnana says</b> that <b>Ulla says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri; and moreover,</b> not only is the <i>halakha</i> in accordance with his opinion with regard to this matter, but in <b>any place where Rabbi Shimon Shezuri taught</b> a <i>halakha</i>, the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with his</b> opinion.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>To which</b> statement of Rabbi Shimon Shezuri is this referring? <b>If we say</b> that it is referring <b>to</b> the statement <b>here,</b> where <b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri says:</b> A scribe <b>may suspend the entire name</b> of God above the line, but he <b>may not suspend part of</b> the name of God above the line, that is difficult: <b>But wasn’t it stated with regard to that</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rav Ḥananel says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that one <b>suspends the name</b> of God above the line, <b>and Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Shmuel</b> says: The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that one may even <b>wipe away</b> the word while the ink is still wet <b>and write</b> the name of God in its place?

### Part 8
<b>And if it is so</b> that when Rabbi Ḥanina said that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon Shezuri he was referring to this matter, then <b>let</b> Ravin bar Ḥinnana <b>also say</b> along with those <i>amora’im</i> that the <i>halakha</i> is that one suspends the entire name of God above the line, but not a part of the name.

### Part 9
<b>Rather,</b> say that Rabbi Ḥanina’s statement that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon Shezuri was referring not to the discussion here, but was stated <b>with regard to this</b> mishna (<i>Ḥullin</i> 74b): <b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri says:</b> If one ritually slaughtered a pregnant cow and the calf was then removed alive, the ritual slaughter of the mother is effective with regard to the calf as well. And <b>even</b> if the calf is <b>five years old and plowing the field</b> when one wants to eat it, <b>the</b> earlier <b>slaughter of its mother renders it permitted,</b> and it does not require ritual slaughter before it is eaten.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>But wasn’t it</b> already <b>stated with regard to that</b> mishna that <b>Ze’eiri says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina</b> says: The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri? And if it is so</b> that when Rabbi Ḥanina said that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon Shezuri he was referring to this matter, then <b>let</b> Ravin bar Ḥinnana <b>also say</b> along with Ze’eiri that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon Shezuri.

### Part 11
<b>Rather,</b> say that Rabbi Ḥanina’s statement was <b>with regard to this</b> mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 65b): <b>Initially</b> the Sages <b>would say:</b> With regard to <b>one who was taken out in a collar [<i>kolar</i>]</b> to be executed <b>and said: Write a bill of divorce for my wife, these</b> people <b>should write and give</b> her the document. Although he did not explicitly say the word give, this is understood to have been his intention, in order to release her from the obligation to perform levirate marriage or <i>ḥalitza</i>. <b>They then said</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies <b>even</b> to <b>one who sets sail and one who departs with a caravan</b> to a distant place. A bill of divorce is given to his wife under these circumstances even if her husband said only: Write a bill of divorce for my wife. <b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri says: Even</b> in the case of <b>one who is dangerously ill</b> who gives that instruction, they write the bill of divorce and give it to his wife.

### Part 12
<b>Alternatively,</b> Rabbi Ḥanina’s statement was <b>with regard to this</b> <i>halakha</i>: In the case of <b><i>teruma</i> of the tithe of <i>demai</i>,</b> which is separated from the produce received from an <i>am ha’aretz</i>, who is suspected of not separating tithes properly, <b>that returned to its</b> original <b>place,</b> i.e., it became mixed with the produce from which it had been separated, <b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri says:</b> In this situation, not only did the Sages permit one to ask the <i>am ha’aretz</i> whether he had set aside his tithes in the proper manner and to rely on his response on Shabbat, a day when it is not permitted to separate tithes, but <b>one may ask him and eat based on his</b> statement <b>even on a weekday.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>But wasn’t it</b> already <b>stated with regard to</b> those <i>mishnayot</i> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri in</b> the case of one who is <b>dangerously ill, and in</b> the case of <b><i>teruma</i> of the tithe of <i>demai</i>? And if it is so</b> that when Rabbi Ḥanina said that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon Shezuri he was referring to these <i>mishnayot</i>, then <b>let</b> Ravin bar Ḥinnana <b>also say</b> along with Rabbi Yoḥanan that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon Shezuri.

### Part 14
<b>Rather,</b> say that Rabbi Ḥanina’s statement was made <b>with regard to this</b> <i>halakha</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei ben Keifar says in the name of Rabbi Shimon Shezuri:</b> If one <b>planted a cowpea</b> plant <b>for</b> its <b>seed,</b> i.e., not to be eaten as a vegetable but for one to either eat or plant its seeds, and <b>some of</b> the plants <b>took root before Rosh HaShana, while some of</b> them took root only <b>after Rosh HaShana, one may not separate <i>teruma</i></b> or tithes <b>from this for that, as one may not separate <i>teruma</i> or tithes from the new</b> crop <b>for the old or from the old</b> crop <b>for the new.</b>

### Part 15
<b>How,</b> then, <b>shall one act</b> so that he not err and set aside <i>teruma</i> and tithes incorrectly? It is difficult to know when the plants took root. He shall <b>pile</b> the entire stock onto <b>his threshing floor, into</b> the middle of <b>it,</b> mix the stock together, and then separate <i>teruma</i> and tithes; <b>and</b> consequently <b>it will turn out</b> that he has <b>separated <i>teruma</i> and tithes from the new</b> crop <b>in</b> the mixture <b>for the new</b> crop <b>in it, and from the old</b> crop <b>in</b> the mixture <b>for the old</b> crop <b>in it.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>Wasn’t it</b> already <b>stated with regard to that</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says that Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri? And if it is so</b> that when Rabbi Ḥanina said that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon Shezuri he was referring to this <i>baraita</i>, then <b>let</b> Ravin bar Ḥinnana <b>also say</b> along with Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon Shezuri.

### Part 17
<b>Rather, Rav Pappa said:</b> Rabbi Ḥanina’s statement was <b>with regard to a chest. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> that it was <b>with regard to wine.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>Rav Pappa said</b>
