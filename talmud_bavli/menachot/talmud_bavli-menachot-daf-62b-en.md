### Part 1
<b>Rav Pappa said</b> there is a different explanation of the dispute between Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and the Rabbis: <b>Everyone,</b> even Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, agrees that with regard to a verbal analogy, the guiding principle <b>is: Infer from it and</b> derive the details <b>from it. And this is</b> the <b>reason for Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi’s ruling that after the slaughter of the communal peace offering one waves the entire body offering, not just the breast and thigh: It is done here <b>like</b> it is done <b>there,</b> in the case of individual peace offerings: <b>Just as there,</b> one waves the <b>item that is a gift to the priest,</b> as the breast and thigh are given to the priests to eat, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the communal peace offerings, one waves the <b>item that is a gift to the priest.</b> Since the communal peace offerings are given to the priests in their entirety, they are also waved in their entirety.

### Part 2
<b>Ravina said</b> an explanation which is the opposite of Rav Pappa’s: <b>Everyone,</b> even the Rabbis, agrees that the guiding principle is: <b>Infer from it but interpret</b> the <i>halakha</i> according <b>to its</b> own <b>place. And this is</b> the <b>reason</b> for the ruling <b>of the Rabbis</b> that one waves only the breast and thigh of communal peace offerings: The verse states with regard to individual peace offerings: “For the breast of waving and the thigh of heaving I have taken from the children of Israel out of their sacrifices of peace offerings, and have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons as an eternal portion from among the children of Israel” (Leviticus 7:34). The term: <b>“Their</b> sacrifices of <b>peace offerings,”</b> is in the plural, despite the fact that the verse is referring to individual peace offerings. This <b>is an amplification,</b> which teaches that the same <i>halakha</i> applies to communal peace offerings, i.e., that only the breast and the thigh are to be waved.

### Part 3
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> There are <b>three types</b> of offerings that <b>require</b> performance of <b>three mitzvot. Two</b> mitzvot are performed <b>on each and every one</b> of them, <b>but the third</b> mitzva <b>is not</b> performed <b>in their</b> sacrifice, meaning that each of these offerings requires two out of the same three mitzvot, but not necessarily the same two as the others. <b>And these are the</b> three offerings: <b>Peace offerings</b> brought as gift offerings by <b>an individual, communal peace offerings,</b> i.e., the two lambs brought with the two loaves on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>and the guilt offering of a leper.</b>

### Part 4
The mishna continues: <b>Peace offerings</b> brought by <b>individuals require placing hands</b> on the head of the animals while the animals are still <b>alive, and waving</b> after they are <b>slaughtered, but there is no</b> obligation of <b>waving them</b> while they are <b>alive. Communal peace offerings require waving</b> both while they are still <b>alive and</b> after they are <b>slaughtered, but there is no</b> obligation of <b>placing hands</b> on them. <b>And the guilt offering of a leper requires placing hands and waving</b> it while it is still <b>alive, but there is no</b> obligation of <b>waving</b> it after it is <b>slaughtered.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara challenges: <b>And let peace offerings</b> brought by <b>an individual require waving</b> while still <b>alive,</b> as this can be derived <b>via an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>And if communal peace offerings,</b> whose <i>halakha</i> is more lenient than that of individual peace offerings in <b>that they do not require placing hands</b> on the head of offerings while they are <b>alive,</b> nevertheless <b>require waving</b> when <b>alive,</b> then with regard to <b>peace offerings</b> brought by <b>an individual, which</b> do <b>require placing hands</b> while <b>alive, is it not logical</b> to conclude <b>that they require waving</b> when <b>alive?</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: This <i>a fortiori</i> inference is not accepted, because <b>the Merciful One excluded</b> peace offerings brought by an individual, as the verse states <b>with regard to communal peace offerings:</b> “And the priest shall wave <b>them</b> with the bread of the first fruits for a wave offering before the Lord, with the two lambs” (Leviticus 23:20). The word <b>“them”</b> serves <b>to exclude peace offerings</b> brought by <b>an individual</b> from the requirement of waving while the animal is alive.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>And let communal peace offerings require placing hands,</b> as this can be derived <b>via an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>And if peace offerings</b> brought by an <b>individual,</b> whose <i>halakha</i> is more lenient than that of communal peace offerings in <b>that they do not require waving</b> while <b>alive,</b> nevertheless <b>require placing hands,</b> then with regard to <b>communal peace offerings, which</b> do <b>require waving</b> when <b>alive, is it not logical</b> to conclude <b>that they require placing hands? Ravina said:</b> This <i>a fortiori</i> inference is not accepted, as it <b>is learned</b> as a tradition from Sinai that there are only <b>two</b> cases of <b>placing hands in communal</b> offerings: The scapegoat on Yom Kippur and the bull brought for an unwitting communal sin.

### Part 8
The Gemara further asks: <b>And let the guilt offering of a leper require waving</b> after the animal has been <b>slaughtered,</b> as this can be derived <b>via an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>And if peace offerings</b> brought by an <b>individual,</b> whose <i>halakha</i> is more lenient than that of the guilt offering of a leper in <b>that they do not require waving</b> when <b>alive,</b> nevertheless <b>require waving</b> after they are <b>slaughtered,</b> then with regard to <b>the guilt offering of a leper,</b> which <b>requires waving</b> while <b>alive, is it not logical</b> to conclude <b>that it</b> also <b>requires waving</b> after it is <b>slaughtered?</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara answers: <b>The Merciful One excluded</b> the guilt offering of a leper, as the verse states <b>with regard to peace offerings</b> brought by <b>an individual:</b> “His own hands shall bring the offerings of the Lord made by fire; the fat with the breast shall he bring; the breast, to wave <b>it</b> before the Lord” (Leviticus 7:30). The word <b>“it”</b> serves <b>to exclude the guilt offering of a leper</b> from the requirement of waving after the animal has been slaughtered.

### Part 10
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to <b>five</b> people <b>who brought one offering</b> together, <b>one</b> of them <b>waves</b> the offering <b>on behalf of all of them. And</b> in the case of <b>a woman</b> who brings an offering, the <b>priest waves</b> the offering <b>on her behalf. And similarly,</b> with regard to <b>one who sends his offerings from overseas,</b> the <b>priest waves</b> them <b>on his behalf.</b>
