### Part 1
<b>From here</b> it is learned <b>that</b> with regard to a mixture of items that <b>ascend</b> to the altar, e.g., the blood of the bull and the goat, the different components of the mixture <b>do not nullify one another. And Rabbi Yehuda holds: From here</b> it is learned <b>that</b> any <b>substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance is not nullified.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara examines Rabbi Yoḥanan’s explanation of the dispute between the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda. With regard to the first part of his explanation, that <b>the Rabbis hold: From here</b> it is learned <b>that</b> with regard to a mixture of items that <b>ascend</b> to the altar the different components of the mixture <b>do not nullify one another,</b> the Gemara suggests: <b>But perhaps</b> the blood of the goat is not nullified when mixed with the blood of the bull <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that it is a substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: <b>Had</b> the verse <b>taught us</b> this <i>halakha</i> by using an example of <b>a substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance, and not taught us</b> a case of a mixture of items that <b>ascend</b> to the altar, the verse would be interpreted <b>as you said.</b> But <b>now that</b> the verse <b>taught us</b> this <i>halakha</i> through a case of a mixture of items that <b>ascend</b> to the altar, it is understood that the reason it is not nullified is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> it is part of a mixture of items that <b>ascend</b> to the altar, not because the substances are of the same type.

### Part 4
The Gemara suggests: <b>But perhaps</b> it is not nullified <b>until</b> both criteria <b>are</b> met, and unless the mixture is both <b>a substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance and</b> a mixture of items that <b>ascend</b> to the altar, one nullifies the other. The Gemara concedes: This is <b>difficult.</b>

### Part 5
With regard to the second part of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s explanation: <b>And Rabbi Yehuda holds: From here</b> it is learned <b>that</b> any <b>substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance is not nullified,</b> the Gemara suggests: <b>But perhaps</b> the blood of the goat is not nullified when mixed with the blood of the bull <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that it is</b> a mixture of items that <b>ascend</b> to the altar.

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: <b>Had</b> the verse <b>taught us</b> this <i>halakha</i> by using an example of a mixture of items that <b>ascend</b> to the altar where the <b>substance</b> is in contact <b>with a different</b> type of <b>substance,</b> the verse would be interpreted <b>as you say.</b> But <b>now that</b> the verse <b>taught us</b> this <i>halakha</i> in a case of <b>a substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance,</b> it is understood that the reason it is not nullified is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that it is a substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara suggests: <b>But perhaps</b> it is not nullified <b>until</b> both criteria <b>are</b> met, and unless the mixture is both <b>a substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance and</b> a mixture of items that <b>ascend</b> to the altar, one nullifies the other. The Gemara concedes: This is <b>difficult.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara raises another objection to the explanation of Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna here that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If the handful was intermingled <b>with the meal offering of priests, with the meal offering of</b> the <b>anointed priest, or with the meal offering of libations,</b> the mixture is <b>unfit because</b> with regard to <b>this,</b> the handful from the standard meal offering, <b>its mixture is thick, and</b> with regard to <b>that,</b> the meal offering of the anointed priest and the meal offering of libations, <b>its mixture is loose. And</b> the mixtures, which are not identical, <b>absorb from each other,</b> invalidating both. The Gemara asks: <b>But when</b> the mixtures <b>absorb from each other, what of it?</b> This <b>is</b> a case of <b>a substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance,</b> and therefore neither oil nullifies the other and both should be sacrificed on the altar.
