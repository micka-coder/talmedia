### Part 1
He stated this <b>with regard to the prohibition of: “You shall not deviate</b> to the left or the right of that which they tell you” (Deuteronomy 17:11). A prohibition by rabbinic law is overridden by human dignity, but not a prohibition by Torah law. Therefore, Mar bar Rav Ashi would have removed his garment had he known about the tear.

### Part 2
<b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> there is a different version of this discussion: It was <b>when</b> they were <b>there,</b> in the place where the corner of Mar bar Rav Ashi’s garment tore, that Ravina <b>said to him</b> that it had torn, <b>and</b> Mar bar Rav Ashi <b>said to him</b> in response: <b>What is your opinion?</b> Do you think <b>that I should throw</b> the garment off? <b>But doesn’t the Master say: Great is human dignity, as it overrides a prohibition in the Torah?</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But Rav bar Shabba interpreted</b> that statement <b>before Rav Kahana:</b> He stated this <b>with regard to the prohibition of: “You shall not deviate,”</b> not the prohibition against carrying in the public domain, which applies by Torah law. The Gemara answers that <b>here too,</b> it is not a prohibition by Torah law, as the place where they were walking was not a full-fledged public domain but <b>a <i>karmelit</i>,</b> in which carrying <b>is</b> prohibited <b>by rabbinic law.</b>
