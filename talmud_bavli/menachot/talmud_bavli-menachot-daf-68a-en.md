### Part 1
<b>Since</b> before the <i>omer</i> <b>you permitted one</b> to harvest the crop <b>only by picking</b> it by hand and not in the typical manner, <b>he will remember</b> the prohibition and refrain from eating it. With regard to searching for leaven, there is no reminder.

### Part 2
<b>Abaye said to him:</b> This <b>works out well</b> in explaining Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion with regard to <b>picking</b> the grain. But with regard to <b>grinding and sifting, what can be said?</b> Apparently, it is permitted to perform these acts in a typical manner. Why, then, is there no concern that one may eat the grain at that stage?

### Part 3
The Gemara responds: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> as one also performs <b>grinding</b> in an atypical manner. One must grind the grain before the sacrificing of the <i>omer</i> <b>with a hand mill,</b> not with a mill powered by an animal or by water. Likewise, <b>sifting</b> is performed unusually, not in the interior of the sifter. Instead, it is performed <b>on top of</b> the <b>sifter.</b> Since all of these actions are performed in an atypical manner, there is no concern that one might eat the grain.

### Part 4
The Gemara raises another difficulty from the case of <b>a field that requires irrigation, where</b> typical <b>harvesting is permitted, as we learned</b> in a mishna (71a): <b>One may harvest</b> grain from <b>an irrigated field and</b> from fields <b>in the valleys,</b> as their grain ripens long before the <i>omer</i> is sacrificed, <b>but one</b> may <b>not pile</b> the produce. The use of the term: One may harvest, indicates that the grain was harvested in a typical manner, not by hand. In this case, <b>what can be said?</b> Why doesn’t Rabbi Yehuda issue a decree lest someone eat from the new grain?

### Part 5
<b>Rather, Abaye said:</b> This difference between the cases of the <i>omer</i> and leaven is not based on the manner in which one harvests, grinds, or sifts. Instead, the reason for the different rulings is that one <b>distances himself from new</b> grain, as it is prohibited to eat the new grain all year until the <i>omer</i> is sacrificed. By contrast, one <b>does not distance himself from leavened bread,</b> as eating it is permitted during the rest of the year. Therefore, he is more likely to eat leavened bread unwittingly.

### Part 6
<b>Rava said:</b> Does the contradiction between one statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> and the other statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> pose <b>a difficulty,</b> while the contradiction between one statement <b>of the Rabbis</b> and the other statement <b>of the Rabbis</b> does <b>not</b> pose <b>a difficult?</b> There is also an apparent contradiction between the opinion of the Rabbis, who claim that the Sages issued a decree with regard to new grain but did not issue a decree with regard to leaven.

### Part 7
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> that the contradiction between one statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> and the other statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> is <b>not difficult, as we resolved</b> it previously. The contradiction between one ruling <b>of the Rabbis</b> and the other ruling <b>of the Rabbis</b> is <b>also not difficult:</b> The Rabbis maintain that there is no need to issue a decree prohibiting searching for leaven after it becomes prohibited, as with regard to one who <b>himself is seeking out</b> leaven specifically in order <b>to burn it,</b> will <b>he eat from it?</b> By contrast, in the case of new grain he is processing the grain and preparing it for consumption. Consequently, there is a concern that he might eat it unwittingly.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The contradiction between one statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> and the other statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> as the difficulty can be resolved in another manner. <b>As we learned</b> in the mishna that the markets of Jerusalem were filled with <b>flour of parched grain.</b> It is permitted to prepare only such foods before the <i>omer</i>, as they are not eaten without further preparation. Therefore, there is no concern lest one eat it unwittingly before the <i>omer</i> offering is sacrificed.

### Part 9
The Gemara rejects this interpretation: <b>And this</b> statement <b>of Rav Ashi is an error [<i>baruta</i>],</b> as this suggestion can easily be refuted: That <b>works out well</b> with regard to the status of the grain <b>from</b> the point that it was processed into <b>flour of parched grain and forward,</b> as there is no concern that perhaps one will come to eat it. But with regard to its status initially, <b>until</b> it became <b>parched grain, what can be said?</b> There must have been a certain point when the grain kernels were edible before they were transformed into parched grain. Why is there no concern that one might eat the kernels at this earlier stage?

### Part 10
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>here too</b> the grain is distinguished by the atypical manner in which it is harvested, <b>through picking</b> by hand, <b>in accordance with</b> the earlier statement <b>of Rabba,</b> nevertheless with regard to the difficulty raised to Rabba’s opinion from the case of <b>an irrigated field, which is permitted</b> to be <b>harvested</b> in the typical manner, <b>what can be said? Rather,</b> the Gemara rejects this explanation and concludes that <b>this</b> statement <b>of Rav Ashi is an error.</b>

### Part 11
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>From</b> the moment <b>that the <i>omer</i></b> offering <b>was sacrificed,</b> the produce of the <b>new</b> crop <b>was permitted immediately.</b> For those <b>distant</b> from Jerusalem, the new crop <b>is permitted from midday and beyond. From</b> the time <b>that the Temple was destroyed, Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai instituted that the day of waving</b> the <i>omer</i>, the sixteenth of Nisan, <b>is entirely prohibited,</b> i.e., one may partake of the new crop only the next day.

### Part 12
<b>Rabbi Yehuda said: But isn’t it forbidden by Torah law, as it is stated:</b> “And you shall eat neither bread, nor parched grain, nor fresh grain, <b>until this selfsame day,</b> until you have brought the offering of your God” (Leviticus 23:14)? This means that the new crop is prohibited on the day of the waving unless permitted by sacrifice of the offering. <b>And</b> if so, <b>for what</b> reason is it <b>permitted</b> for those <b>distant</b> to eat the new crop <b>from midday and beyond,</b> when the Temple is standing? It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that they know that the</b> members of the <b>court are not indolent in its</b> sacrifice, and certainly by midday the sacrifice of the <i>omer</i> offering has been completed.

### Part 13
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, as presented in the mishna, is that after the destruction of the Temple the new crop is prohibited throughout the entire sixteenth of Nisan by Torah law. With regard to the dissenting opinion that the new crop is permitted on the sixteenth of Nisan, <b>Rav and Shmuel both say: When the Temple is standing,</b> the sacrifice of the <b><i>omer</i></b> offering <b>permits</b> the new crop. <b>When the Temple is not standing, the illumination of the eastern</b> horizon on the sixteenth of Nisan <b>permits</b> it.

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason? Two verses are written</b> with regard to the new crop. More precisely, there are two clauses in the same verse: “And you shall eat neither bread, nor parched grain, nor fresh grain, until this selfsame day, until you have brought the offering of your God” (Leviticus 23:14). <b>It is written</b> that the new crop is prohibited <b>“until you have brought</b> the offering,” <b>and it is</b> also <b>written</b> that the new crop is prohibited only <b>“until the selfsame day.” How so?</b> How can these clauses be reconciled?

### Part 15
The Gemara answers: <b>Here,</b> when the verse permits the new crop only after the sacrifice of the <i>omer</i> offering, it is referring to the period <b>when the Temple is standing. There,</b> when the verse permits the new crop immediately upon the sixteenth of Nisan, it is speaking of the period <b>when the Temple is not standing.</b>

### Part 16
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish both say: Even when the Temple is standing, the illumination of the eastern</b> horizon <b>permits</b> the new crop. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written: “Until you have brought</b> the offering,” which indicates that the new crop is not permitted at daybreak, but only after the <i>omer</i> offering is sacrificed? The Gemara answers: The verse means that one should wait to partake of the new crop until after the <i>omer</i> offering is brought <i>ab initio</i>, in order <b>to</b> fulfill <b>the mitzva</b> in the optimal fashion, but nevertheless it is permitted at daybreak.

### Part 17
The Gemara raises another difficulty. The mishna states: <b>From</b> the moment <b>that the <i>omer</i></b> offering <b>was sacrificed,</b> the produce of the <b>new</b> crop <b>was permitted immediately.</b> This indicates that the new crop is not permitted at the illumination of the eastern horizon. The Gemara again answers that the mishna means that one should wait to partake of the new crop until after the sacrifice of the <i>omer</i> offering in order <b>to</b> fulfill <b>the mitzva</b> in the optimal fashion, but it is permitted at daybreak.

### Part 18
The Gemara raises yet another difficulty from the next mishna (68b): Sacrifice of <b>the <i>omer</i></b> offering <b>would permit</b> consumption of the new crop <b>in</b> the rest of <b>the country [<i>bamedina</i>]</b> outside the Temple, <b>and the two loaves</b> offering permitted the sacrifice of the new crop <b>in the Temple.</b> Here, too, the Gemara answers: One should wait to partake of the new crop until after the sacrifice of the <i>omer</i> offering in order <b>to</b> fulfill <b>the mitzva</b> in the optimal fashion.
