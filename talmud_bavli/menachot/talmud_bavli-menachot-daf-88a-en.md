### Part 1
If so, <b>which</b> size vessel shall <b>I bring in its stead</b> to complete the tally of seven vessels? <b>Rather, there was an additional measuring vessel of one and a half <i>log</i> there</b> in the Temple, <b>with which one would measure</b> the oil used <b>for the griddle-cake</b> offering <b>of the High Priest; one and a half <i>log</i></b> were used <b>in the morning</b> and <b>one and a half <i>log</i> in the afternoon.</b>

### Part 2
The Rabbis <b>said to</b> Rabbi Shimon: There is no need for a dedicated vessel for the one and a half <i>log</i> for the High Priest’s offering, as <b>there was</b> a vessel of <b>one-half of a <i>log</i> there,</b> in the Temple, <b>and</b> it is <b>possible to calculate</b> the required one and a half <i>log</i> <b>by</b> using the vessel of <b>one-half of a <i>log</i></b> three times.

### Part 3
Rabbi Shimon <b>said to them:</b> But <b>according to your statement as well, one should not fashion</b> a vessel of <b>one-half of a <i>log</i> or</b> of one <b><i>log</i>,</b> as <b>there was</b> a vessel of <b>one-quarter</b> of a <i>log</i> <b>there, and</b> it is <b>possible to calculate</b> whatever quantity is required <b>by</b> repeatedly using the vessel of <b>one-quarter</b> of a <i>log</i>. <b>Rather, this was the principle</b> with regard to measuring vessels <b>in the Temple:</b> A measuring <b>vessel that</b> was <b>used for</b> measuring <b>this quantity was not used</b> to measure <b>a different quantity.</b>

### Part 4
The <i>baraita</i> concludes with an opinion that is also stated in the mishna: <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says: There were graduations on</b> the vessel that held one <b><i>hin</i>,</b> indicating the respective quantities needed for the bull, the ram, and the lamb.

### Part 5
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>. <b>What</b> difference <b>is there between</b> the opinions of <b>Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda?</b> They both list the same seven vessels, but in a different order. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The practical difference <b>between them</b> concerns whether the vessels consecrate the <b>overflow [<i>beirutzei</i>] of</b> the <b>measuring vessels,</b> i.e., the liquid that flows down over the outer walls of the vessel when it is filled beyond capacity.

### Part 6
<b>According to the one who said</b> that the vessels should be listed <b>in ascending</b> order of size, i.e., Rabbi Yehuda, <b>he holds</b> that the <b>overflow of measuring vessels is consecrated.</b> His reasoning is as follows: When Moses was commanded to fashion these vessels, <b>the Merciful One</b> initially <b>gave Moses</b> a measuring vessel of <b>one-quarter</b> of a <i>hin</i> <b>and said to him:</b> With this vessel <b>calculate</b> the various quantities needed and fashion vessels accordingly. So, for example, to calculate one-half of a <i>hin</i>, Moses would twice fill up the vessel of one-quarter of a <i>hin</i>, each time pouring it into a larger vessel. When pouring from a small vessel into a larger one, the <b>overflow</b> also <b>enters</b> the larger one and so it is included in the calculation. Evidently, the overflow is also consecrated.

### Part 7
<b>According to the one who said</b> that the vessels should be listed <b>in descending</b> order of size, i.e., Rabbi Meir, <b>he holds</b> that the <b>overflow of measuring vessels is not consecrated.</b> His reasoning is as follows: When Moses was commanded to fashion these vessels for the Temple, <b>the Merciful One</b> initially <b>gave Moses</b> a measuring vessel of one <b><i>hin</i> and said to him: With this</b> vessel <b>calculate</b> the various quantities needed and fashion vessels accordingly. So, for example, to calculate one-half of a <i>hin</i>, Moses filled the vessel of one <i>hin</i> and divided it equally into two vessels. Then, to calculate one-quarter of a <i>hin</i>, he would equally divide the liquid in one of those vessels into another two vessels. When pouring from a large vessel into a smaller one, the overflow on the outer walls of the larger vessel does not enter the smaller vessel but instead falls to the ground. Therefore, the <b>overflow is excluded</b> from the calculation. Accordingly, there is no basis to say that the overflow is consecrated.

### Part 8
<b>Abaye said: Everyone,</b> both Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Meir, agrees that with regard to the <b>overflow of measuring vessels, one could say</b> that <b>they are consecrated and one could say</b> that <b>they are not consecrated,</b> i.e., their dispute is unrelated to this issue. <b>But here they disagree with regard to</b> the meaning of the term <b>“full”</b> in the verse: “And his offering was one silver dish, its weight was one hundred and thirty shekels, one silver basin of seventy shekels, after the shekel of the Sanctuary; both of them full of fine flour mixed with oil for a meal offering” (Numbers 7:13).

### Part 9
<b>The one who said</b> that the vessels should be listed <b>in descending</b> order of size, i.e., Rabbi Meir, <b>holds</b> that the term <b>“full”</b> indicates that the size of each vessel should be exact, i.e., <b>that it should</b> hold <b>neither less nor more</b> than the prescribed amount. If one calculates the various sizes by first filling a vessel of the largest size, one <i>hin</i>, and then dividing its contents carefully between two smaller vessels and so on, one will arrive at accurate measurements. By contrast, if one starts with the smallest size and uses it multiple times to calculate larger quantities, then each time one pours he includes the overflow of the smaller vessel, and so the quantities calculated are slightly larger than prescribed.

### Part 10
<b>And the one who said</b> that the vessels should be listed <b>in ascending</b> order of size, i.e., Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds</b> that the intention of the term <b>“full”</b> is that the size of each vessel <b>should not</b> hold <b>less</b> than the prescribed amount, <b>but</b> if <b>it</b> holds <b>more,</b> that <b>is</b> still <b>called full.</b> Accordingly, the various quantities can be calculated by starting with the smallest vessel.

### Part 11
In the mishna and the <i>baraita</i> cited above <b>the Master said</b> that in contrast to the opinion of the Rabbis, <b>Rabbi Shimon says: There was no</b> vessel <b>there</b> in the Temple that held one <b><i>hin</i>,</b> as what purpose could a one-<i>hin</i> vessel serve? That volume of liquid was never used in an offering. The Gemara comments: <b>Rabbi Shimon is saying well to the Rabbis,</b> i.e., this is a reasonable objection. <b>And</b> what would <b>the Rabbis</b> say? Why is there a measuring vessel of one <i>hin</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>It was</b> the vessel of one <b><i>hin</i> that Moses fashioned</b> in the wilderness <b>for</b> measuring the <b>anointing oil</b> with which the Tabernacle, its vessels, and the priests were anointed, <b>as it is written: “And of olive oil a <i>hin</i>.</b> And you shall make it a holy anointing oil” (Exodus 30:24–25).

### Part 12
The Gemara explains the dispute between Rabbi Shimon and the Rabbis. One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Shimon, <b>holds</b> that <b>since there was no</b> further <b>need</b> for the vessel of one <i>hin</i> <b>in</b> future <b>generations,</b> Moses <b>fashioned it</b> only <b>for</b> the sake of that <b>time, and</b> then afterward <b>it was sequestered. And the other</b> Sage, the Rabbis, holds that <b>since it was</b> fashioned and used in the time of Moses, <b>it was</b> kept in the Temple despite the fact there was no longer a need for it.

### Part 13
<b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that after claiming that there was no vessel of one <i>hin</i>, Rabbi Shimon asked: If so, <b>which</b> size vessel shall <b>I bring in its stead</b> to complete the tally of seven vessels? The Gemara asks: <b>Is it not possible to</b> simply <b>not include</b> a seventh vessel? What compels him to list a seventh? The Gemara explains: It is just <b>as Ravina said</b> with regard to a different matter: It <b>is learned</b> as a tradition that there are <b>two</b> instances in which <b>placing hands</b> on the head of the offering is required <b>for communal</b> offerings. <b>Here too,</b> one must say that it <b>is learned</b> as a tradition that <b>there were seven measuring vessels for liquids in the Temple.</b>

### Part 14
The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says:</b> It was not necessary to have separate vessels for the meal offerings and libations of each type of animal. Rather, <b>there were graduations on</b> the vessel that held one <b><i>hin</i></b> indicating the measures for the various offerings. The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t</b> Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Tzadok, <b>have</b> the tradition that there were <b>seven measuring vessels?</b> The Gemara concedes: <b>He does not have</b> that tradition. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that he has that tradition, but he understands that <b>what</b> is meant by <b>seven measuring vessels?</b> It means that <b>seven</b> fixed ways of <b>measuring</b> should exist, but not that there must be seven different vessels.

### Part 15
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>What</b> purpose <b>did</b> the <b>quarter-</b><i>log</i> measuring vessel <b>serve?</b> It was used to measure <b>a quarter-</b><i>log</i> <b>of water for</b> the purification of <b>the leper, and a quarter-</b><i>log</i> <b>of oil for</b> the wafers and loaves that <b>the nazirite</b> brings on the day that his term of naziriteship ends.

### Part 16
<b>What</b> purpose <b>did</b> the <b>half</b>-<i>log</i> measuring vessel <b>serve?</b> It was used to measure <b>a half-</b><i>log</i> <b>of water for</b> the rite of <b>the <i>sota</i> and a half-</b><i>log</i> <b>of oil for</b> the three types of loaves of <i>matza</i> accompanying <b>the thanks offering.</b>

### Part 17
<b>And with</b> the vessel of one <b><i>log</i>, one would measure</b> the oil <b>for all the</b> standard <b>meal offerings.</b>

### Part 18
Each tenth of an ephah of flour requires one <i>log</i> of oil. Accordingly, <b>even</b> if one brings <b>a meal offering of sixty tenths</b> of an ephah of flour, <b>one adds to it sixty <i>log</i></b> of oil. <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> Each meal offering, irrespective of its volume, <b>even a meal offering of sixty tenths</b> of an ephah of flour, requires <b>only its</b> single <b><i>log</i></b> of oil, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the offering brought by a poor leper on the day of his purification: “And a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil <b>for a meal offering, and a <i>log</i> of oil”</b> (Leviticus 14:21). The juxtaposition of “a meal offering” with “a <i>log</i> of oil” teaches a principle for all meal offerings: Each offering requires only one <i>log</i> of oil.

### Part 19
The mishna lists the quantities of oil and wine that were required for the meal offerings and libations that accompanied the sacrifice of an animal. <b>Six</b> <i>log</i>, i.e., one<b>-</b>half of a <i>hin</i>, <b>for</b> those of <b>a bull; and four</b> <i>log</i>, i.e., one-third of a <i>hin</i>, <b>for</b> those of <b>a ram; and three</b> <i>log</i>, i.e., one-quarter of a <i>hin</i>, <b>for</b> those of <b>a lamb.</b>

### Part 20
In addition, <b>three and a half</b> <i>log</i> of oil were required <b>for the Candelabrum,</b> as there were seven lamps and <b>a half-<i>log</i></b> was required <b>for each lamp.</b>

### Part 21
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>was sitting</b> in study <b>and posed a difficulty: For what</b> purpose <b>was</b> the <b>quarter-</b><i>log</i> measuring vessel <b>anointed</b> with the anointing oil, thereby consecrating it a service vessel? <b>If</b> you suggest it was necessary in order to measure the water used in the purification of <b>a leper,</b>
