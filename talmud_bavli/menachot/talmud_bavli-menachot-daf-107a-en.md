<b>the crop and feathers,</b> which are thrown on the ground next to the altar and are not burned.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>But aren’t there</b> wine <b>libations,</b> which are poured entirely onto the altar? The Gemara answers that the wine is not actually poured onto the altar; it is poured into ducts on the side of the altar and <b>goes</b> down <b>to the drainpipes.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t there a meal offering</b> brought with <b>libations,</b> which is entirely burned on the altar? The Gemara answers that when one says: It is incumbent upon me to bring to the altar, his intent is clearly to bring a type of offering that is only sacrificed on the altar. A meal offering brought with libations is a type of meal offering. Therefore, <b>since there are</b> other types of <b>a meal offering from which the priests eat,</b> after a handful has been removed from it and burned, a meal offering brought with libations <b>is not a clear</b> example of an offering that is sacrificed on the altar in its entirety, and certainly was not <b>his</b> intent. Therefore, his intent must have been to bring frankincense.

### Part 4
§ The mishna teaches that one who says: <b>It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>gold</b> to the Temple treasury, <b>must</b> donate <b>no less than a gold dinar.</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>But perhaps</b> his intention in using the word gold is not to a coin at all, but to a small <b>piece [<i>naskha</i>]</b> of gold. <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> The case of the <i>baraita</i> is <b>where he said</b> the word <b>coin.</b> The Gemara challenges further: <b>But perhaps</b> his intention is not to a dinar, but to smaller coins, such as <b><i>perutot</i>. Rav Pappa said: People do not make <i>perutot</i> of gold.</b> Therefore, it is unlikely that this was his intent.

### Part 5
§ The mishna teaches that one who says: It is incumbent upon me to donate <b>silver</b> to the Temple maintenance, <b>must</b> donate <b>no less than</b> the value of a silver <b>dinar.</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>But perhaps</b> his intention in using the word silver is not to a coin at all, but to a small <b>piece</b> of silver. <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> The case of the <i>baraita</i> is <b>where he said</b> the word <b>coin.</b> The Gemara challenges further: <b>But perhaps</b> his intention is not to a dinar, but to smaller coins, such as <b><i>perutot</i>. Rav Pappa said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> of the <i>baraita</i> is stated <b>with regard to a place where silver <i>perutot</i> do not circulate.</b>

### Part 6
§ The mishna teaches that one who says: It is incumbent upon me to donate <b>copper</b> to the Temple maintenance, <b>must</b> donate <b>no less than</b> the value of <b>a silver <i>ma’a</i>. It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: He must</b> donate <b>no less than</b> the amount needed to forge <b>a small copper hook.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>For what</b> use <b>is</b> that <b>suitable</b> in the Temple? <b>Abaye said: They scrape</b> the <b>wicks</b> from the Candelabrum <b>with it and clean</b> the <b>lamps</b> of the Candelabrum <b>with it.</b>

### Part 7
The mishna discusses pledges of gold, silver, and copper. What is the <i>halakha</i> if one says: It is incumbent upon me to donate <b>iron? It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>others say:</b> He <b>must</b> donate <b>no less than</b> the amount that can be made into a base and spike designed to <b>eliminate the ravens [<i>mikkalya orev</i>].</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And how much</b> is that? <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> One <b>cubit</b> in width <b>by</b> one <b>cubit</b> in length.

### Part 8
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> another version of this <i>baraita</i> and the subsequent explanation: One who pledges to donate iron <b>must</b> donate <b>no less than</b> one <b>cubit</b> in width <b>by</b> one <b>cubit</b> in length. The Gemara asks: <b>For what is</b> this amount of iron <b>suitable? Rav Yosef said:</b> It is suitable <b>for</b> a base and spike designed to <b>eliminate the ravens.</b>

### Part 9
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> One who says: <b>It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring a libation of <b>wine, must</b> bring <b>no less than three <i>log</i>,</b> as that is the minimum amount of wine brought as a libation accompanying an animal offering. One who says: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>oil, must</b> bring <b>no less than a <i>log</i>,</b> as the smallest meal offering includes one <i>log</i> of oil. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> He must bring no less than <b>three <i>log</i>,</b> as that is the amount of oil in the meal offering that accompanies the sacrifice of a lamb, which is the smallest amount in any of the meal offerings that accompany the sacrifice of an animal.

### Part 10
One who says: <b>I specified</b> how many <i>log</i> I vowed to bring <b>but I do not know what</b> amount <b>I specified, must bring</b> an amount of oil <b>equivalent to</b> the amount brought on the <b>day</b> that the <b>largest</b> amount of oil is sacrificed in the Temple.

### Part 11
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Torah states with regard to libations: “All that are native born shall do these things in this manner, in presenting an offering made by fire, of a pleasing aroma to the Lord” (Numbers 15:13). As this verse is superfluous, the various terms in it are used to derive <i>halakhot</i>. The term <b>“native born” teaches that one may pledge libations</b> independently, even when they are not sacrificed together with an offering. <b>And how much</b> is the minimum size that is offered? <b>Three <i>log</i>,</b> which is the smallest measurement of a libation in the Torah and is offered with a lamb.

### Part 12
<b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that if one desires to add</b> to this amount, <b>he may add</b> to it? <b>The verse states</b> with regard to libations associated with the additional offerings for the New Moon: “And their libations: Half a <i>hin</i> of wine <b>shall be</b> for the bull, and the third part of a <i>hin</i> for the ram, and the fourth part of a <i>hin</i> for the lamb (Numbers 28:14). From the superfluous “shall be” one may understand that there are other amounts of wine that may be brought as independent libations. One <b>might</b> have thought that he can <b>decrease</b> the amount of wine in a libation to less than three <i>log</i>. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “All that are native born shall do these things, <b>in this manner”</b> (Numbers 15:13), i.e., one may not bring less than three <i>log</i> of wine.

### Part 13
The mishna teaches that if one said: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>oil, he must</b> bring <b>no less than a <i>log</i>,</b> as the smallest meal offering includes a <i>log</i> of oil. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> He must bring no less than <b>three <i>log</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle do they <b>disagree?</b>

### Part 14
<b>The Sages said before Rav Pappa:</b> The Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>disagree with regard to</b> the proper method of logical derivation when deriving the <i>halakha</i> with regard to one matter from the <i>halakha</i> with regard to another matter. One opinion holds that the proper method is to <b>infer from it, and</b> again <b>from it,</b> i.e., equate the two cases in all aspects, while the other holds that the comparison extends only to one specific issue derived from the primary case, in accordance with the principle: <b>Infer from it but interpret</b> the <i>halakha</i> according <b>to its</b> own <b>place,</b> i.e., in all other aspects the cases are not equated.

### Part 15
The Sages explained: <b>The Rabbis hold</b> by the principle: <b>Infer from it, and</b> again <b>from it.</b> The Gemara explains the application of this principle: <b>Just as a meal offering is contributed, so too oil is contributed,</b> as inferred from the verse addressing the meal offering. <b>And</b> again one infers <b>from</b> this source: <b>Just as a meal offering</b> requires <b>a <i>log</i></b> of oil, <b>so too here,</b> an offering of oil alone must be <b>a <i>log</i> of oil.</b>

### Part 16
<b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds</b> that the proper method is to <b>infer from it but interpret</b> the <i>halakha</i> according <b>to its</b> own <b>place: Just as a meal offering is contributed, so too oil is contributed. But</b> with regard to all other aspects of this <i>halakha</i>, <b>interpret</b> the <i>halakha</i> according <b>to its</b> own <b>place,</b> and its status is <b>like</b> that of <b>libations,</b> which are similar to oil in that they are also poured onto the altar: <b>Just as</b> one contributes <b>libations</b> of <b>three <i>log</i>, so too</b> when one contributes <b>oil,</b> one contributes <b>three <i>log</i>.</b>

### Part 17
<b>Rav Pappa said to</b> the Sages who suggested this interpretation: <b>If Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>derived</b> the source of the gift offering of oil <b>from</b> the verse addressing the <b>meal offering,</b> he would not disagree with the Rabbis, <b>as everyone</b> employs the principle of: <b>Infer from it, and</b> again <b>from it. Rather, Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>derives</b> the gift offering of oil <b>from</b> a verse concerning libations: “All that are <b>native born</b> shall do these things in this manner, in presenting an offering made by fire” (Numbers 15:13). Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi derives from here that just as one may contribute wine libations, so too one may contribute oil. Therefore, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi compares oil to wine libations: Just as one contributes libations of three <i>log</i>, so too one contributes three <i>log</i> of oil.

### Part 18
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Natan, said to Rav Pappa: And how can you say that</b> according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi the source of the gift offering of oil is not from the meal offering? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “And when one brings a meal offering <b>[<i>korban minḥa</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 2:1), that the superfluous word <i>korban</i> <b>teaches that one may contribute oil. And how much</b> must one contribute? <b>Three <i>log</i>.</b> The Gemara explains the question: <b>Who did you hear that says</b> the gift offering of oil is <b>three <i>log</i>? This is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and</b> yet he <b>cites</b> the source of the gift offering of oil <b>from</b> the word <b><i>korban</i>,</b> which is referring to a meal offering. Rav Pappa <b>said to him: If</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught, it is taught,</b> and I cannot take issue with it.

### Part 19
The mishna teaches that one who says: <b>I specified</b> how many <i>log</i> I vowed to bring <b>but I do not know what</b> number <b>I specified, must bring</b> an amount of oil <b>equivalent to</b> the amount brought on the <b>day</b> that the <b>largest</b> amount of oil is sacrificed in the Temple. The Sages <b>taught:</b> He must bring an amount of oil <b>equivalent to</b> the amount that is brought on <b>the first day of the Festival,</b> i.e., <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>when it occurs on Shabbat.</b> The offerings brought on that day include the additional offerings for <i>Sukkot</i> and also the additional offerings for Shabbat, and the total amount of oil brought on that day is 140 <i>log</i>.

### Part 20
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> One who says: <b>It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a burnt offering, must bring a lamb,</b> which is the least expensive land animal sacrificed as an offering. <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says:</b> He may bring <b>either a dove or a pigeon,</b> as a bird burnt offering.

### Part 21
One who says: I vowed to bring a burnt offering, and <b>I specified</b> that it would be <b>from the herd, but I do not know what</b> animal <b>I specified, must bring a bull and a male calf,</b> as a burnt offering is brought only from male animals. One who says: I vowed to bring a burnt offering and I specified that it would be <b>from the animals but I do not know what</b> animal <b>I specified, must bring a bull and a male calf, a ram, a large male goat, a small male goat, and a male lamb.</b> One who says: I vowed to bring a burnt offering, and <b>I specified</b> what type of burnt offering it would be, <b>but I do not know what I specified,</b>
