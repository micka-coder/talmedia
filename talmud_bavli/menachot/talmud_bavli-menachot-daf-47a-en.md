### Part 1
§ The Gemara cites further discussion of the two sheep and the two loaves of <i>Shavuot</i>: <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The</b> two <b>sheep</b> of <b><i>Shavuot</i> consecrate the</b> two <b>loaves</b> that accompany them <b>only by</b> means of their <b>slaughter.</b>

### Part 2
<b>How so?</b> If <b>one slaughtered</b> the sheep <b>for their</b> own <b>sake,</b> as the peace offerings that are supposed to be sacrificed on <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>and</b> then the priest <b>sprinkled their blood</b> on the altar <b>for their</b> own <b>sake,</b> then <b>the loaves are consecrated.</b> But if <b>one slaughtered them not for their</b> own <b>sake, and</b> the priest <b>sprinkled their blood not for their</b> own <b>sake, the loaves are not consecrated.</b> If <b>one slaughtered them for their</b> own <b>sake and he sprinkled their blood not for their</b> own <b>sake, the loaves are</b> partially <b>consecrated, but they are not</b> fully <b>consecrated.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says:</b> The loaves are <b>never consecrated</b> at all <b>until one slaughters</b> the offerings <b>for their</b> own <b>sake and sprinkles their blood for their</b> own <b>sake.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, who holds that the slaughtering of the sheep partially consecrates the loaves even without the sprinkling of the blood?

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: It is based on the fact <b>that it is written</b> concerning the ram brought by the nazirite when he completes his naziriteship: <b>“And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice [<i>zevaḥ</i>] of peace offerings to the Lord, with the basket of unleavened bread”</b> (Numbers 6:17). Since the verse uses the word <i>zevaḥ</i>, which also means slaughter, and the verse then makes reference to the loaves, <b>that is to say that</b> it is specifically the <b>slaughter</b> that <b>consecrates</b> the loaves that accompany the offering. Similarly, the slaughter of the sheep brought as peace offerings on <i>Shavuot</i> consecrates the accompanying two loaves, as the <i>halakha</i> of the loaves of <i>Shavuot</i> is derived from that of the loaves of the nazirite.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what is the reasoning of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon,</b> who holds that the slaughtering and sprinkling of the blood together consecrate the loaves? The Gemara answers: He derives it from the term: <b>“He shall offer,”</b> which he understands to mean that the loaves are not consecrated <b>until</b> the priest <b>performs all of the actions</b> included in the sacrificial rites of that offering, including the sprinkling of the blood.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>also, isn’t it written: “He shall offer,”</b> which indicates that the loaves are consecrated only once the blood has been sprinkled on the altar? The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> it were <b>written: A sacrifice [<i>zevaḥ</i>] he shall offer,</b> it would be <b>as you are saying</b> that he should slaughter it and then perform a further action, i.e., sprinkling the blood, in order to consecrate the loaves. <b>Now that it is written: “He shall offer</b> the ram for <b>a sacrifice [<i>zevaḥ</i>],”</b> it should be understood as: <b>By what</b> means <b>should he offer</b> the ram in order to consecrate the loaves? <b>By</b> means of <b>slaughtering [<i>zeviḥa</i>].</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, isn’t it written: “A sacrifice [<i>zevaḥ</i>],”</b> indicating that slaughtering alone consecrates the loaves? The Gemara answers: <b>He requires that</b> expression <b>for</b> that <b>which Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> says, <b>as Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>everyone,</b> including Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, <b>concedes that the loaves must be</b> in existence <b>at the time of the slaughter.</b>

### Part 8
§ The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is meant by Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s statement in the <i>baraita</i> that if one slaughtered the sheep for their own sake and sprinkled their blood not for their own sake, then the loaves are partially <b>consecrated, but they are not</b> fully <b>consecrated? Abaye says:</b> The loaves are <b>consecrated</b> by means of the slaughtering, <b>but</b> their consecration is <b>not complete. Rava says:</b> The loaves are fully <b>consecrated</b> by means of the slaughtering, <b>but</b> they are <b>not</b> thereby <b>permitted</b> to be eaten.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between them?</b> Everyone concedes that the loaves may not be eaten as a result of this slaughtering. The Gemara answers: The practical difference <b>between them</b> is the ability <b>to transfer</b> sanctity to <b>their redemption</b> money. <b>According to Abaye,</b> who holds that the loaves are not completely consecrated, they <b>do not transfer</b> sanctity to <b>their redemption</b> money if one tries to redeem them for money. <b>According to Rava,</b> who holds that the loaves are completely consecrated, they <b>transfer</b> sanctity to <b>their redemption</b> money.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to Rava,</b> who holds that according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi the loaves are completely sanctified, <b>that is</b> the difference <b>between</b> the opinions of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi and <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon.</b> But <b>according to Abaye, what</b> difference <b>is there between</b> the opinions of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi and <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon?</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: The practical difference <b>between them</b> is <b>with regard to</b> whether the loaves are <b>rendered unfit by</b> means of <b>leaving</b> the Temple courtyard after the slaughtering of the offering. According to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, the loaves are rendered unfit if they leave the courtyard. According to Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, who holds that the loaves are not consecrated, they are not rendered unfit if they leave the courtyard.

### Part 12
§ The Gemara continues the discussion of the dispute between Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, concerning the consecration of the two loaves by means of the slaughter and sprinkling of the blood of the sheep of <i>Shavuot</i>. <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak raised a dilemma before Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba:</b> In the case of a communal peace offering of two <b>sheep</b> that accompany the two loaves on <b><i>Shavuot</i> that one slaughtered for their sake but</b> the priest <b>sprinkled their blood not for their sake,</b> concerning <b>those</b> accompanying <b>loaves, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to eating</b> them?

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion was this dilemma raised? <b>If</b> it was raised <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, doesn’t he say</b> that <b>it is</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood <b>that consecrates the loaves?</b> Consequently, if the blood was not properly sprinkled, it is clear that the loves are unfit and may not be eaten. And <b>if</b> it was raised <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>both according to</b> the opinion <b>of Abaye and according to</b> that of <b>Rava,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi holds that the loaves <b>are consecrated but are not permitted</b> to be eaten.

### Part 14
The Gemara responds: <b>Rather,</b> one must say that the question was asked <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of this</b> following <b><i>tanna</i>. As the father of Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba teaches</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In a case where <b>the two loaves left</b> the Temple courtyard <b>between</b> the <b>slaughtering</b> of the offering <b>and</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of its blood, <b>and</b> then the priest <b>sprinkled the blood of</b> the <b>sheep</b> with the intent that their meat would be eaten <b>beyond their</b> designated <b>time,</b> the sheep are rendered <i>piggul</i>. With regard to the loaves, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: The loaves do not</b> become prohibited <b>due to</b> the prohibition of <b><i>piggul</i>. Rabbi Akiva says: The loaves do</b> become prohibited <b>due to</b> the prohibition of <b><i>piggul</i>.</b>

### Part 15
<b>Rav Sheshet said: These <i>tanna’im</i>,</b> Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Akiva, both <b>hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who said:</b> The <b>slaughtering consecrates</b> the loaves by itself. Consequently, if the loaves are taken out of the Temple courtyard after the sheep are slaughtered, the loaves become disqualified.

### Part 16
<b>But</b> they disagree as to the following: <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>says</b> that <b>sprinkling</b> the blood <b>is not effective with regard to</b> offerings that <b>left</b> the Temple courtyard. Since the loaves left the courtyard before the sprinkling of the blood, the intent of the priest while sprinkling the blood that the offering be eaten outside of its designated time does not render the loaves <i>piggul</i>. <b>And Rabbi Akiva</b> conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as Rabbi Akiva says</b> that <b>sprinkling</b> the blood <b>is effective with regard to</b> offerings that <b>left</b> the Temple courtyard. Therefore, the intent of the priest while sprinkling the blood that the offering be eaten outside of its designated time renders the loaves <i>piggul</i>, even though they left the courtyard.
