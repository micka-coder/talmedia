### Part 1
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>Perhaps</b> the sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya were referring to a case <b>where</b> one <b>tied knots</b> between the sets of windings even though there is no obligation to do so.

### Part 2
<b>And Rabba says: Learn from it</b> that <b>the uppermost knot</b> in the ritual fringes is required <b>by Torah</b> law. <b>As, if</b> it <b>enters your mind</b> to say that it is <b>by rabbinic</b> law, whereas by Torah law it is sufficient to merely insert the strings into the hole without tying any knots, for <b>what</b> reason <b>was</b> it <b>necessary</b> for the Torah <b>to permit</b> placing wool <b>ritual fringes</b> on a linen <b>cloak?</b> It is <b>obvious</b> that it is permitted, since if <b>one attaches</b> a swatch of wool and a swatch of linen <b>with a single connection, it is not</b> considered <b>a connection</b> with regard to the prohibition against wearing a garment that includes both wool and linen. <b>Rather, learn from</b> it that the uppermost knot is required <b>by Torah law.</b>

### Part 3
§ <b>Rabba bar Rav Adda says</b> that <b>Rav Adda says</b> that <b>Rav says: If a string was severed at its base,</b> i.e., where it is connected to the garment, the ritual fringes are <b>unfit. Rav Naḥman sat</b> in the study hall <b>and stated this <i>halakha</i>. Rava raised an objection to Rav Naḥman</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said,</b> i.e., that there is a minimum length required for the strings? That is only when the strings are <b>initially</b> affixed to the garment. <b>But</b> in the <b>end,</b> i.e., after the strings are affixed in an acceptable manner, <b>its remainder and its severed</b> strings are fit at <b>any</b> length.

### Part 4
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What</b> is <b>its remainder and what</b> are <b>its severed</b> strings? <b>What, is it not</b> that when the <i>baraita</i> mentions <b>its remainder</b> it is referring to a case <b>where</b> parts <b>of the</b> strings <b>were severed and</b> parts <b>of them remain, and</b> when the <i>baraita</i> mentions <b>its severed</b> strings it is referring to a case <b>where</b> the strings <b>were completely severed,</b> and nevertheless the strings are fit for the mitzva?

### Part 5
The Gemara responds to Rava’s objection: <b>No,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is teaching one</b> <i>halakha</i>, and the <i>baraita</i> should be understood as follows: <b>The remainder of its severed</b> strings are fit at <b>any length.</b> The Gemara asks: If so, <b>let</b> the <i>baraita</i> simply <b>say: Its severed</b> strings are fit at any length; <b>why do I</b> need the mention of <b>its remainder? This teaches us that we require a remainder of its severed</b> strings long <b>enough to</b> wrap them around the other strings and <b>tie them in a slipknot.</b>

### Part 6
§ <b>Rabba sat</b> in the study hall <b>and said in the name of Rav:</b> The <b>string</b> used <b>for winding</b> around the other strings <b>is counted in the quota</b> of ritual fringes, i.e., it is one of the eight strings on each corner, and there is no need to have an additional string for winding. <b>Rav Yosef said to</b> Rabba: <b>Shmuel said it, and not Rav.</b> This <b>was also stated</b> by another <i>amora</i>: <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says: Rabbi Yoshiya of Usha told me</b> that the <b>string</b> used <b>for winding</b> around the other strings <b>is counted in the quota</b> of ritual fringes.

### Part 7
<b>Rava sat</b> in the study hall <b>and said in the name of Shmuel:</b> If one <b>wound the majority of</b> the white and the <b>sky-blue</b> strings instead of leaving the larger portion of the strings hanging loose beyond the windings, the ritual fringes are nevertheless <b>fit. Rav Yosef said to</b> Rava: <b>Rav said it, and not Shmuel.</b> The Gemara supports Rav Yosef’s version from that which <b>was also stated: Rav Huna bar Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet says</b> that <b>Rav Yirmeya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> If one <b>wound the majority of</b> the white and the <b>sky-blue</b> strings, the ritual fringes are nevertheless <b>fit.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rav Ḥiyya, son of Rav Natan, teaches</b> this discussion <b>like this: Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet says</b> that <b>Rav Yirmeya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> If one <b>wound the majority of</b> the white and the <b>sky-blue</b> strings, the ritual fringes are nevertheless <b>fit. And even</b> if <b>he wound only one set of</b> windings, the ritual fringes are <b>fit. But</b> the <b>finest</b> way to affix the white and <b>sky-blue</b> strings is to ensure that <b>one-third</b> of the length of the strings is <b>windings and two-thirds</b> are <b>loose</b> hanging strings.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>And what</b> is the <b>measure</b> of <b>a set</b> of windings? It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> It is <b>such that one winds</b> once <b>and</b> winds <b>a second and third</b> time, i.e., each set must contain at least three windings. It was <b>taught: One who minimizes</b> the sets of windings <b>may not</b> have <b>fewer than seven</b> sets, <b>and one who adds</b> to this number of sets <b>may not</b> have <b>more than thirteen</b> sets of windings.

### Part 10
The Gemara provides explanations for these guidelines: <b>One who minimizes</b> the sets of windings <b>may not</b> wind <b>fewer than seven</b> sets, <b>corresponding to</b> the <b>seven firmaments. And one who adds</b> to this number of sets <b>may not</b> wind <b>more than thirteen</b> sets of windings, <b>corresponding to</b> the <b>seven firmaments and</b> the <b>six air</b> spaces <b>between them.</b>

### Part 11
It was <b>taught: When one begins</b> to form the windings, he <b>begins</b> winding <b>with a white</b> string. This is because the verse indicates that one first inserts “the fringe of <b>the corner”</b> (Numbers 15:38), i.e., the white strings, which are of the same <b>type</b> as the <b>corner</b> of the garment. <b>And when he concludes</b> the windings, <b>he concludes with a white</b> string, in accordance with the principle: <b>One elevates</b> to a higher level <b>in</b> matters of <b>sanctity and does not downgrade.</b>

### Part 12
§ The Gemara relates: <b>Rav and Rabba bar bar Ḥana were sitting</b> together. <b>A certain man was passing by wearing a cloak that</b> was made <b>entirely of sky-blue</b> wool, <b>on which he had affixed</b> white and <b>sky-blue</b> strings,
