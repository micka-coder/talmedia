### Part 1
<b>and</b> so you say with regard to <b>the guilt offering of a leper,</b> whose proper sacrifice enables the leper to enter the Israelite camp and to partake of offerings of sanctity, <b>that</b> if one <b>slaughtered</b> these offerings <b>not for their sake, they are disqualified.</b> They are disqualified <b>since</b> their sacrifice <b>came to render</b> the nazirite and leper <b>fit, and</b> these guilt offerings <b>did not render</b> them <b>fit.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna that <b>all the meal offerings</b> from <b>which a handful was removed not for their sake are fit</b> for sacrifice <b>but they did not satisfy the obligation of the owner, except for the meal offering of a sinner and the meal offering of jealousy. And if it is so</b> that an <i>omer</i> meal offering from which a handful was removed not for its own sake is disqualified, then <b>let</b> the mishna <b>also teach: Except for the <i>omer</i> meal offering.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara responds: <b>When</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> this <i>halakha</i>, it teaches it only with regard to meal offerings that <b>come</b> on behalf of <b>an individual.</b> The mishna <b>does not teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to those meal offerings that <b>come</b> on behalf of the <b>community.</b> Additionally, <b>when</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> this <i>halakha</i>, it is only with regard to a meal offering that <b>comes on account of itself,</b> i.e., as an independent offering. The mishna <b>does not teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a meal offering that <b>comes on account of,</b> i.e., together with, <b>a slaughtered offering,</b> e.g., the <i>omer</i> meal offering, which is brought along with two sheep.

### Part 4
The Gemara adds: Furthermore, <b>when</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> this <i>halakha</i>, it is only with regard to <b>those</b> meal offerings <b>whose time is not set,</b> i.e., they may be sacrificed on any date. The mishna <b>does not teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>this</b> <i>omer</i> meal offering, <b>whose time</b> for offering <b>is set</b> on the sixteenth of Nisan.

### Part 5
§ The Gemara analyzes the statement of Rav. <b>The Master said: And so you say with regard to the guilt offering of a nazirite</b> who became ritually impure, <b>and</b> so you say with regard to <b>the guilt offering of a leper, that</b> if one <b>slaughtered</b> these offerings <b>not for their sake, they are disqualified.</b> They are disqualified <b>since</b> their proper sacrifice <b>came to render</b> the nazirite and leper <b>fit, and they did not render</b> them <b>fit.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>We learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Zevaḥim</i> 2a): <b>All slaughtered offerings that one slaughtered not for their sake are fit, but they did not satisfy the obligation of the owner.</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to all offerings <b>except for the Paschal offering and the sin offering,</b> which are disqualified when slaughtered not for their sake. <b>And if it is so</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the statement of Rav, <b>let</b> the mishna <b>also teach: Except for the guilt offering of a nazirite and the guilt offering of a leper, since they came to render</b> one <b>fit and they did not render</b> one <b>fit.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara answers: <b>Since there</b> are other guilt offerings, i.e., <b>the guilt offering for robbery,</b> which one brings for taking a false oath denying an accusation of robbery, <b>and the guilt offering</b> brought <b>for misuse</b> of consecrated property, <b>that come for atonement,</b> which do not render one fit and are fit for sacrifice if they were slaughtered not for their sake, the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna could <b>not</b> state the <i>halakha</i> with regard to guilt offerings in <b>an absolute</b> manner, and therefore he refrains from mentioning guilt offerings at all.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>the guilt offering of a nazirite and the guilt offering of a leper?</b> Why are they disqualified when slaughtered not for their sake <b>since they came to render fit and they did not render fit? These,</b> i.e., the guilt offerings for robbery and for misuse of consecrated property, should <b>likewise</b> be disqualified when slaughtered not for their sake, since they <b>came for atonement and they did not atone.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya said</b> in response: <b>We find that the Torah differentiates between</b> those guilt offerings that <b>atone and</b> those that <b>render fit,</b> and the <i>halakha</i> is more stringent with regard to those that render fit. Rabbi Yirmeya elaborates: With regard to those guilt offerings that <b>atone, there are among them</b> offerings <b>that come after death,</b> i.e., they are sacrificed after the death of their owners, whereas with regard to those that <b>render fit, there are none among them that come after death. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kinnim</i> 2:5): With regard to <b>a woman</b> after childbirth <b>who brought her sin offering</b> for her ritual purification <b>and died, the heirs shall bring her burnt offering,</b>which comes to atone. If she set aside <b>her burnt offering and died, the heirs shall not bring her sin offering,</b> as it comes to render her fit to partake of offerings.

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi, objects to this:</b> With regard to offerings that <b>render fit as well, are there not among them</b> offerings <b>that come after death? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Me’ila</i> 11a): In the case of <b>one who separates funds for</b> the offerings of <b>his naziriteship,</b> i.e., his sin offering, burnt offering, and peace offering, a person <b>may not derive benefit</b> from them <i>ab initio</i>, <b>but</b> if one benefited from them after the fact, he is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property, i.e., he is not required to bring a guilt offering and is not obligated to repay the principal and an additional fifth. This is <b>because</b> the coins <b>are all fit for bringing peace offerings,</b>and there is no misuse of consecrated property with regard to funds fit for a peace offering.

### Part 11
The mishna continues: If the nazirite <b>died and he had undesignated funds</b> that he set aside to pay for his nazirite offerings without specifying how much money should be allocated toward each offering, <b>they will be allocated for</b> communal <b>gift</b> offerings. If he left behind <b>allocated</b> funds, then with regard to <b>the money for a sin offering,</b> one must <b>take</b> it and cast it <b>into the Dead Sea; one may not benefit</b> from it <i>ab initio</i>, <b>but</b> if one benefited from it after the fact, he is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property. With regard to <b>the money for a burnt offering, one brings with it a burnt offering, and</b> one is liable for <b>misusing them.</b>

### Part 12
The mishna concludes: With <b>the money for a peace offering, one brings a peace offering with it, and</b> these offerings <b>are eaten for one day,</b> like the peace offering brought by a nazirite, <b>and do not require</b> the <b>loaves</b> that are normally bought with the peace offering of a nazirite. Rabbi Yehuda explains his question: <b>But</b> the <b>burnt offering and peace offering of a nazirite are</b> offerings <b>that render</b> the nazirite <b>fit</b> to drink wine, <b>and</b> yet <b>they come after death.</b>

### Part 13
<b>Rav Pappa said</b> in response that <b>this is what Rabbi Yirmeya is saying: We do not find</b> an instance of <b>a fixed</b> manner of <b>rendering fit that comes after death,</b> i.e., there is no instance where the only offering that will render one fit to act in a manner previously prohibited to him may be sacrificed after death. <b>And</b> the offerings <b>of a nazirite</b> are examples of a means of <b>rendering fit that is not fixed,</b>
