to teach <b>that if one omitted one of the placements</b> of blood, <b>he has done nothing.</b>

### Part 2
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If the priest <b>performed the seven sprinklings of</b> the blood of <b>the</b> red <b>heifer</b> improperly, <b>either</b> by performing them <b>not for their</b> own <b>sake or</b> performing them <b>not precisely toward the entrance of the Tent of Meeting</b> of the Tabernacle (Numbers 19:4), which corresponds to the Sanctuary in the Temple, <b>they are not valid.</b>

### Part 3
<b>But</b> with regard to the sprinkling of the blood <b>that</b> takes place <b>inside</b> the Sanctuary, of inner sin offerings, the blood of the bull and goat of Yom Kippur, the blood of the bull of the anointed priest, the blood of the bull for an unwitting communal sin, and the blood of the goats of idol worship, which are to be sprinkled “before the Lord, in front of the Curtain of the Sanctuary” (Leviticus 4:6), <b>and</b> the sprinkling of the oil <b>that</b> takes place during the purification <b>of the leper,</b> which is done “seven times before the Lord” (Leviticus 14:16), if these are performed <b>not for their</b> own <b>sake,</b> then <b>they are not valid.</b> But if they are performed <b>not precisely</b> toward the direction where they should be sprinkled, <b>they are valid.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>concerning</b> the sprinklings of the blood of the red <b>heifer</b> that if they were performed <b>not for their</b> own <b>sake, they are not valid,</b> but if they were performed <b>not precisely</b> toward the entrance of the Tent of Meeting or Sanctuary, <b>they are valid? Rav Ḥisda said:</b> This is <b>not difficult; this</b> second <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> whereas <b>that</b> first <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b>

### Part 5
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Kelim</i> 1:10): With regard to <b>those who have not yet</b> brought <b>an atonement</b> offering to complete the purification process, and therefore are not permitted to enter the Temple or partake of sacrificial meat, <b>who entered the</b> Temple <b>courtyard unwittingly,</b> they are <b>liable</b> to bring <b>a sin offering.</b> If they entered <b>intentionally,</b> then this is <b>punishable by <i>karet</i>. And needless to say,</b> the same applies to <b>one</b> who was ritually impure <b>who immersed that day</b> and is waiting for nightfall for the purification process to be completed <b>and all the others who are ritually impure</b> and have not yet immersed.

### Part 6
<b>And</b> with regard to those who are <b>pure who entered beyond their boundaries,</b> i.e., beyond where it is permitted for them to enter, such as a priest who enters the Sanctuary for a purpose other than performing the Temple service, if one entered <b>any</b> part <b>of the Sanctuary,</b> he is liable <b>to</b> receive <b>forty</b> lashes. If he entered <b>within the Curtain</b> separating the Sanctuary and Holy of Holies, i.e., into the Holy of Holies, or he entered the Holy of Holies all the way until he was <b>before the Ark Cover,</b> he is liable <b>to</b> receive <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If he entered <b>any</b> part <b>of the Sanctuary or within the Curtain</b> separating the Sanctuary and Holy of Holies, he is liable <b>to</b> receive <b>forty</b> lashes; <b>but</b> if he entered the Holy of Holies all the way until he was <b>before the Ark Cover,</b> he is liable <b>to</b> receive <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven.

### Part 7
<b>With regard to what</b> issue <b>do</b> the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda <b>disagree?</b> They disagree <b>with regard to</b> the proper understanding of <b>this verse: “And the Lord said to Moses: Speak to Aaron your brother, that he not come at all times into the holy place, within the Curtain, before the Ark Cover which is upon the Ark, that he not die”</b> (Leviticus 16:2). <b>The Rabbis hold</b> that entering <b>into the holy place,</b> i.e., the Sanctuary, is <b>subject to</b> the prohibition of: <b>He shall not come,</b> and one who violates it is punished with lashes, whereas entering <b>within the Curtain</b> separating the Sanctuary and Holy of Holies <b>and before the Ark Cover</b> is <b>subject to</b> the warning of: <b>He shall not die,</b> and entering there is punished by death at the hand of Heaven.

### Part 8
<b>And Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that entering <b>into the holy place,</b> i.e., the Sanctuary, <b>and within the Curtain</b> separating the Sanctuary and Holy of Holies is <b>subject to</b> the prohibition of: <b>He shall not come,</b> and one who violates it is punished with lashes, whereas entering <b>before the Ark Cover</b> is <b>subject to</b> the warning of: <b>He shall not die,</b> and entering there is punished by death at the of Heaven.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the interpretation <b>of the Rabbis?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> it should <b>enter your mind</b> to explain the verse <b>as Rabbi Yehuda says,</b> then <b>let the Merciful One write:</b> That he not come at all times <b>into the holy place and before the Ark Cover</b> that he not die, <b>and there is no need</b> to write <b>“within the Curtain,” and I would say:</b> If one <b>becomes liable</b> to receive lashes for even entering the <b>Sanctuary, is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to teach that one incurs this punishment for entering <b>within the Curtain? Why do I</b> need the phrase <b>“within the Curtain” that the Merciful One wrote? Learn from</b> that seemingly extraneous term that entering the Holy of Holies is punishable <b>by death</b> at the hand of Heaven.

### Part 10
<b>And Rabbi Yehuda</b> understands: <b>If the Merciful One had written</b> only that it is prohibited to come <b>“into the holy place” and did not write “within the Curtain,” I would say: What</b> is the <b>holy place?</b> It is <b>within the Curtain,</b> i.e., the Holy of Holies, and one who enters it violates a prohibition, <b>but</b> if one enters the <b>Sanctuary</b> he does <b>not even</b> violate <b>a prohibition. And the Rabbis</b> respond to this claim: <b>You cannot say that, as the entire Sanctuary is called</b> “the <b>holy place,” as it is stated: “And the Curtain shall divide for you between the holy place and the Holy of Holies”</b> (Exodus 26:33).

### Part 11
<b>And what is the reason</b> for the interpretation <b>of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> Why does he hold that one who enters the Holy of Holies violates a prohibition but is not punished with death at the hand of Heaven? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yehuda holds that <b>if</b> it should <b>enter your mind</b> to explain <b>as the Rabbis say,</b> that entering the Holy of Holies is punishable by death at the hand of Heaven, <b>let the Merciful One write:</b> That he not come at all times <b>into the holy place and within the Curtain</b> that he not die, <b>and there is no need</b> to write <b>“before the Ark Cover.” And I would say:</b> If entering <b>within the Curtain,</b> i.e., the Holy of Holies, is punished <b>with death</b> at the hand of Heaven, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to teach that one incurs this punishment for entering <b>before the Ark Cover? Why do I</b> need the phrase <b>“before the Ark Cover” that the Merciful One wrote? Learn from</b> that seemingly extraneous term that entering <b>before the Ark Cover</b> is punishable <b>by death</b> at the hand of Heaven, but entering <b>within the Curtain</b> merely violates <b>a prohibition.</b>

### Part 12
<b>And the Rabbis</b> understand: <b>Indeed,</b> it is so <b>that</b> in order to teach the punishment of death at the hand of Heaven it <b>is not necessary</b> for the verse to also state “before the Ark Cover.” <b>And</b> the reason <b>that the Merciful One wrote “before [<i>el penei</i>] the Ark Cover”</b> was in order <b>to exclude</b> one who entered the Holy of Holies through <b>a roundabout path,</b> as one who did not enter facing the Ark Cover, i.e., from the east, is not punished with death at the hand of Heaven.

### Part 13
This is <b>as the school of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov taught:</b> With regard to the verse: “And he shall sprinkle it with his finger <b>before [<i>el penei</i>] the Ark Cover to the east”</b> (Leviticus 16:14), <b>this established a paradigm</b> that <b>any place</b> in the Torah <b>where it is stated: “Before [<i>penei</i>],”</b> it is referring to <b>nothing other than before</b> the <b>eastern</b> side.

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> respond to this, as it is clear that the term “before [<i>el penei</i>] the Ark Cover” is necessary to exclude one who entered the Holy of Holies through a roundabout path? The Gemara answers: According to Rabbi Yehuda, if the purpose was for that reason, <b>let the verse say: Before [<i>penei</i>]</b> the Ark Cover. <b>What</b> is the purpose of the word <b><i>el</i>? Learn from</b> that seemingly extraneous term that one is punished with death at the hand of Heaven <b>specifically</b> if he entered directly <b>before</b> the Ark, but not if he merely entered the Holy of Holies. <b>And the Rabbis</b> hold that the term <b>“<i>el</i>”</b> does <b>not</b> mean <b>specifically</b> one who enters directly before the Ark Cover.

### Part 15
The Gemara now returns to its suggestion that the contradiction between the two <i>baraitot</i> with regard to whether the sprinklings of the red heifer are valid or not when performed not precisely toward the entrance of the Tent of Meeting can be resolved by explaining that one <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda and the other is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda, who says</b> that the expression <b>“before [<i>el penei</i>] the Ark Cover”</b> teaches that the punishment is limited to one who <b>specifically</b> entered directly before the Ark Cover, holds that the expression: <b>“And sprinkle</b> of its blood <b>toward [<i>el</i>] the front”</b> (Numbers 19:4), <b>also</b> means that the sprinklings must be performed <b>specifically</b> toward the front of the Sanctuary.

### Part 16
<b>And the Rabbis</b> are of the opinion that <b>from</b> the fact <b>that there</b> the term <i>el</i> does <b>not</b> mean <b>specifically</b> that one is liable to be punished with death at the hand of Heaven only if he enters directly before the Ark Cover, <b>here too</b> they hold that it is <b>not</b> meant <b>specifically,</b> and therefore the sprinklings are valid even when performed not precisely toward the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.

### Part 17
<b>Rav Yosef objects to this</b> explanation: <b>According to Rabbi Yehuda, from</b> the fact <b>that</b> there the term <b><i>el</i></b> is used <b>specifically,</b> the verse: “And he shall sprinkle of the blood <b>before [<i>al</i></b> <i>penei</i>] the Ark Cover” (Leviticus 16:14) should <b>also</b> mean that the sprinkling must be performed <b>specifically</b> upon the Ark Cover. <b>But</b> in the time <b>of the Second Temple, where there was no Ark or Ark Cover,</b> would Rabbi Yehuda then say that <b>indeed</b> the <b>sprinklings were not performed?</b> This is clearly not correct, as all agree that the sprinklings were performed in the Second Temple (see <i>Yoma</i> 53b).

### Part 18
<b>Rabba bar Ulla said</b> in response: <b>The verse states</b> with regard to the Yom Kippur service: <b>“And he shall make atonement for the most holy place [<i>mikdash hakodesh</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 16:33), which is interpreted as follows: He will sprinkle the blood to make atonement not specifically on the Ark [<i>hakodesh</i>], but even on <b>the place that is dedicated [<i>hamkudash</i>] for the Ark [<i>lakodesh</i>].</b>

### Part 19
The Gemara offers another resolution of the contradiction between the <i>baraitot</i> concerning whether the sprinklings of the red heifer are valid or invalid when performed not precisely toward the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. <b>Rava said:</b> Both <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> <i>baraita</i> are in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis:</b>
