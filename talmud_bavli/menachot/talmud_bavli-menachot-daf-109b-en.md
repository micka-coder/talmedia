### Part 1
as by slaughtering the idolatrous offering intentionally <b>he became a servant of idol worship.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rav Naḥman said: From where do I say</b> that even a priest who intentionally slaughters an idolatrous offering is nevertheless fit to serve in the Temple if he repents? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a priest who served</b> in <b>idol worship and repented, his offering</b> in the Temple <b>is an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord and is acceptable.

### Part 3
Rav Naḥman clarifies: <b>In what</b> manner did he serve in idol worship? <b>If we say</b> that he served in idol worship <b>unwittingly, what</b> does the <i>baraita</i> mean when it says: <b>And repented? He is already repentant,</b> as he never intended to sin in the first place. <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>of intentional</b> idol worship. <b>And if</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to sprinkling</b> the blood of an idolatrous offering, <b>when he repents, what of it? Hasn’t he performed</b> idolatrous <b>service,</b> thereby disqualifying himself from serving in the Temple in any event? <b>Rather, is it not</b> referring <b>to</b> the <b>slaughter</b> of an idolatrous offering? Evidently, even if the priest slaughtered it intentionally, once he repents he is fit to serve in the Temple.

### Part 4
<b>And</b> as for <b>Rav Sheshet, he</b> could have <b>said to you</b> that <b>actually</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to unwitting</b> slaughter. <b>And this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: If</b> the priest <b>is repentant from the outset, as when he served</b> in idol worship <b>he served unwittingly,</b> then <b>his offering is an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord and is acceptable. <b>But if not,</b> i.e., he slaughtered an idolatrous offering intentionally, <b>his</b> subsequent <b>offering</b> in the Temple is <b>not an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord.

### Part 5
§ The Gemara lists other similar disagreements between Rav Naḥman and Rav Sheshet. In a case where a priest <b>bowed to</b> an object of <b>idol worship, Rav Naḥman says:</b> If he subsequently repents and serves in the Temple, <b>his offering is an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord. <b>And Rav Sheshet says: His offering is not an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord. In a case where a priest <b>acknowledges</b> an object of <b>idol worship</b> as a divinity, <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> If he subsequently repents and serves in the Temple, <b>his offering is an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord. <b>And Rav Sheshet says: His offering is not an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord.

### Part 6
Having listed four similar disputes between Rav Naḥman and Rav Sheshet, namely, with regard to a priest who unwittingly sprinkled the blood of an idolatrous offering, a priest who intentionally slaughtered an idolatrous offering, a priest who bowed to an idol, and a priest who acknowledged an idol as a divinity, the Gemara explains: <b>And</b> it was <b>necessary</b> to teach the dispute with regard to all four cases. <b>As, had</b> the Sages <b>taught us</b> only <b>this first</b> case, where a priest sprinkles the blood of an idolatrous offering unwittingly, one might have thought that only <b>in that</b> case <b>Rav Sheshet says</b> that the priest’s subsequent service in the Temple is disqualified, <b>because he performed a service for</b> idolatry that is considered a sacrificial rite in the Temple. <b>But</b> in a case where the priest merely performed <b>slaughter, since he did not perform a service for</b> idolatry that is a sacrificial rite in the Temple, there is room to <b>say</b> that Rav Sheshet <b>concedes to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman.</b>

### Part 7
<b>And had</b> the Sages <b>taught us</b> only the dispute with regard to a priest intentionally performing <b>slaughter</b> for an idolatrous offering, one might have thought that Rav Sheshet says that the priest’s subsequent service in the Temple is disqualified <b>because he performed</b> a sacrificial <b>rite for</b> idolatry. <b>But</b> if he merely <b>bowed</b> to the idol, <b>since he did not perform</b> a sacrificial <b>rite for</b> idolatry, there is room to <b>say</b> that Rav Sheshet does <b>not</b> disqualify the priest’s subsequent service in the Temple. Therefore, it was <b>necessary</b> to teach this case as well.

### Part 8
<b>And had</b> the Sages <b>taught us</b> only the case of a priest <b>bowing</b> to an idol, one might have thought that in this case Rav Sheshet says that the priest’s subsequent service in the Temple is disqualified <b>because he performed an action for</b> idolatry. <b>But</b> if he only <b>acknowledged</b> the idol as a divinity, <b>which is mere speech,</b> there is room to <b>say</b> that Rav Sheshet does <b>not</b> disqualify the priest’s subsequent service in the Temple. The Gemara concludes: Therefore, it was <b>necessary</b> to teach this case as well.

### Part 9
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And needless to say,</b> if priests served for <b>something else,</b> a euphemism for idolatry, they are disqualified from service in the Temple. The Gemara comments: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that it says: Needless to say,</b> if they served for <b>something else, by inference, the temple of Onias is not</b> a temple of <b>idol worship,</b> but rather a temple devoted to the worship of God.

### Part 10
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>like the one who says</b> that <b>the temple of Onias is not</b> a temple of <b>idol worship. As it is taught:</b> During <b>the year in which Shimon HaTzaddik died, he said to</b> his associates: <b>This year, he will die,</b> euphemistically referring to himself. <b>They said to him: From where do you know?</b>

### Part 11
Shimon HaTzaddik <b>said to them:</b> In previous years, <b>every Yom Kippur,</b> upon entering the Holy of Holies, I had a prophetic vision in which <b>I would be met by an old man</b> who was <b>dressed in white, and</b> his head was <b>wrapped in white, and he would enter</b> the Holy of Holies <b>with me, and he would leave with me.</b> But <b>this year, I was met by an old man</b> who was <b>dressed in black, and</b> his head was <b>wrapped in black, and he entered</b> the Holy of Holies <b>with me, but he did not leave with me.</b> Shimon HaTzaddik understood this to be a sign that his death was impending.

### Part 12
Indeed, <b>after the pilgrimage festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>he was ill for seven days and died. And his fellow priests refrained from reciting the</b> Priestly <b>Benediction with the</b> ineffable <b>name</b> of God.

### Part 13
<b>At the time of his death, he said to</b> the Sages: <b>Onias, my son, will serve</b> as High Priest <b>in my stead. Shimi,</b> Onias’ <b>brother, became jealous</b> of him, <b>as</b> Shimi <b>was two and a half years older than</b> Onias. Shimi <b>said to</b> Onias treacherously: <b>Come and I will teach you the order of the service</b> of the High Priest. Shimi <b>dressed</b> Onias <b>in a tunic [<i>be’unkeli</i>] and girded him with a ribbon [<i>betziltzul</i>]</b> as a belt, i.e., not in the vestments of the High Priest, and <b>stood him next to the altar.</b> Shimi <b>said to his fellow priests: Look what this</b> man <b>vowed and fulfilled for his beloved,</b> that he had said to her: <b>On the day that I serve in the High Priesthood I will wear your tunic and gird your ribbon.</b>

### Part 14
<b>The fellow priests of</b> Onias <b>wanted to kill him</b> because he had disgraced the Temple service with his garments. Onias <b>ran</b> away <b>from them and they ran after him. He went to Alexandria in Egypt and built an altar there, and sacrificed</b> offerings <b>upon it for the sake of idol worship. When the Sages heard of the matter they said: If this</b> person, Shimi, <b>who did not enter</b> the position of High Priest, acted with <b>such</b> jealousy, <b>all the more so</b> will <b>one who enters</b> a prestigious position rebel if that position is taken away from him. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> According to Rabbi Meir, the temple of Onias was built for idol worship.

### Part 15
<b>Rabbi Yehuda said to him:</b> The <b>incident was not like this. Rather, Onias did not accept</b> the position of High Priest <b>because his brother Shimi was two and a half years older than him,</b> so Shimi was appointed as High Priest. <b>And even so,</b> even though Onias himself offered the position to Shimi, <b>Onias was jealous of his brother Shimi.</b> Onias <b>said to</b> Shimi: <b>Come and I will teach you the order of the service</b> of the High Priest. <b>And</b> Onias <b>dressed</b> Shimi <b>in a tunic and girded him in a ribbon and stood him next to the altar.</b> Onias <b>said to his fellow priests: Look what this</b> man, Shimi, <b>vowed and fulfilled for his beloved,</b> that he had said to her: <b>On the day that I serve in the High Priesthood I will wear your tunic and gird your ribbon.</b>

### Part 16
<b>His fellow priests wanted to kill</b> Shimi. Shimi then <b>told them the entire incident,</b> that he had been tricked by his brother Onias, so the priests <b>wanted to kill Onias.</b> Onias <b>ran</b> away <b>from them, and they ran after him.</b> Onias <b>ran to the palace of the king, and they ran after him. Anyone who saw him would say: This is him, this is him,</b> and he was not able to escape unnoticed. Onias <b>went to Alexandria in Egypt and built an altar there, and sacrificed</b> offerings <b>upon it for the sake of Heaven. As it is stated: “In that day shall there be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at its border, to the Lord”</b> (Isaiah 19:19). According to Rabbi Yehuda, the temple of Onias was dedicated to the worship of God.

### Part 17
<b>And when the Sages heard of the matter they said: If this one,</b> Onias, <b>who fled from</b> the position of High Priest and offered it to his brother, still was overcome with <b>such</b> jealousy to the point where he tried to have Shimi killed, <b>all the more so</b> will <b>one who wants to enter</b> a prestigious position be jealous of the one who already has that position.

### Part 18
§ As a corollary to the statement of the Sages with regard to one who is jealous and wants the position of another, <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Peraḥya said: Initially,</b> in response to <b>anyone who would say</b> to me: <b>Ascend to</b> the position of <i>Nasi</i>, <b>I would tie him up and place him in front of a lion</b> out of anger for his suggestion. <b>Now</b> that I have become the <i>Nasi</i>, in response to <b>anyone who tells me to leave</b> the position, <b>I</b> would <b>throw a kettle [<i>kumkum</i>] of boiling</b> water <b>at him</b> out of anger at his suggestion.

### Part 19
It is human nature that after one ascends to a prestigious position he does not wish to lose it. <b>As</b> evidence of this principle, <b>Saul</b> initially <b>fled from</b> the kingship, as he did not wish to be king, as stated in the verse: “When they sought him he could not be found…Behold he has hidden himself among the baggage” (I Samuel 10:21–22). <b>But when he ascended</b> to the kingship <b>he tried to kill David,</b> who he thought was trying to usurp his authority (see I Samuel, chapters 18–27).

### Part 20
§ <b>Mar Kashisha, son of Rav Ḥisda, said to Abaye: What does Rabbi Meir do with this verse of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> Since Rabbi Meir holds that the temple of Onias was dedicated to idol worship, how does he explain the verse in Isaiah?

### Part 21
Abaye answered Mar Kashisha and said that Rabbi Meir uses this verse <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>After the downfall of Sennacherib,</b> the king of Assyria who besieged Jerusalem (see II Kings, chapters 18–19), King <b>Hezekiah emerged</b> from Jerusalem <b>and found the</b> gentile <b>princes</b> Sennacherib had brought with him from his other conquests, <b>sitting in carriages [<i>bikronot</i>] of gold. He made them vow that they would not worship idols,</b> and they fulfilled their vow, <b>as it is stated</b> in Isaiah’s prophecy about Egypt: <b>“In that day there shall be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak the language of Canaan</b>
