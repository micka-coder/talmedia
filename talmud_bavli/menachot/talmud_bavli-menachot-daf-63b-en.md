### Part 1
<b>And is it stated</b> with regard to a meal offering baked in an oven: <b>“Offering,”</b> and again: <b>Offering,</b> for a total of <b>two times,</b> once in connection to a meal offering of loaves and once in connection to a meal offering of wafers? If that were the case, it would indicate that these are two types of offerings. But <b>doesn’t it</b> actually <b>say “offering” only one</b> time: “And when you bring a meal offering baked in an oven, it shall be unleavened loaves of fine flour mixed with oil, or unleavened wafers spread with oil” (Leviticus 2:4)? <b>And it is stated with regard to this</b> meal offering both <b>loaves and wafers,</b> which indicates that these are two varieties of the same offering.

### Part 2
Rabbi Shimon continues: <b>From now</b> it may be inferred that if one <b>wants to bring</b> ten <b>loaves he may bring</b> ten loaves, and if he prefers to bring ten <b>wafers, he may bring</b> ten wafers, and if he decides that <b>half</b> of them should be <b>loaves and half</b> of them <b>wafers, he may bring</b> it in this manner. <b>And</b> if he brings part as loaves and part as wafers, how does he proceed? He <b>mingles</b> all of <b>them and removes a handful from both of them. And</b> if <b>he removed a handful and</b> it happened that only part <b>of one</b> type, either loaves or wafers, <b>came up in his hand for both of them,</b> he has <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation, as they are both part of a single offering.

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Yehuda says: From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to one who says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a baked meal offering, that he may not bring half</b> of the offering as <b>loaves and half</b> as <b>wafers?</b> He answers: <b>The verse states: “And every meal offering that is baked in an oven, and every one that is made in the deep pan, and on the shallow pan, shall belong to the priest who sacrifices it. And every meal offering, mixed with oil, or dry, shall belong to all the sons of Aaron,</b> one as well as another” (Leviticus 7:9–10).

### Part 4
The verses juxtapose the meal offering baked in an oven to the meal offering prepared on the pan and the meal offering prepared in the deep pan, and similarly to the meal offering brought as a gift, alluded to by the phrase: “Mixed with oil,” and to the meal offering of a sinner, which is called: “Dry.” This teaches that <b>just as</b> the term: <b>“And every”</b> (Leviticus 7:10), <b>stated below</b> with regard to those meal offerings, is referring to <b>two different types</b> of meal offering, <b>so too,</b> the term: <b>“And every”</b> (Leviticus 7:9), <b>stated above,</b> with regard to the two forms of meal offering baked in an oven, is referring to <b>two different types</b> of meal offering, and therefore one may not bring part as loaves and part as wafers.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who maintains that loaves and wafers are two different types of meal offerings baked in an oven, respond to Rabbi Shimon’s proof? After all, <b>Rabbi Shimon is saying well</b> when he points out that the verse mentions “offering” only once. The Gemara explains: Rabbi Yehuda could have <b>said to you: Since it is written: “With oil,”</b> and: <b>“With oil,”</b> in the verse: “It shall be unleavened loaves of fine flour mixed with oil, or unleavened wafers spread with oil” (Leviticus 2:4), it is considered <b>as though it is written “offering”</b> and <b>“offering,”</b> and therefore these are deemed two different types of meal offering.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> respond to this claim? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Shimon maintains that the repetition of the term “with oil” teaches a different <i>halakha</i>. <b>If it were not written “with oil,”</b> and again <b>“with oil,” I would say</b> that a meal offering baked in an oven must be <b>specifically</b> brought <b>half</b> as <b>loaves and half</b> as <b>wafers, and</b> if he wanted to bring only <b>loaves alone or wafers alone,</b> I would <b>say</b> that he may <b>not</b> bring a meal offering in this manner. The repetition of the term “with oil” <b>teaches us</b> that a meal offering baked in an oven can comprise ten loaves, or ten wafers, or a combination of both types.

### Part 7
The Gemara further inquires: The <i>baraita</i> states that Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, holds that loaves and wafers are two different types of meal offerings. The opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, is</b> the same as that of <b>his father,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, whose opinion is also mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>. Why is it necessary to cite Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion separately? The Gemara explains: It is necessary to cite the opinion of Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Yehuda, because there is a practical difference <b>between</b> his ruling and that of his father; <b>as, if</b> someone transgressed and <b>performed</b> the sacrifice of a meal offering baked in an oven by bringing a mixture of loaves and wafers, according to Rabbi Yehuda the offering is valid after the fact, whereas Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Yehuda deems it not valid even after the fact.
