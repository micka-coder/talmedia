### Part 1
<b>They</b> would <b>permit</b> the use of <b>consecrated branches of carob and of sycamore</b> trees; <b>they</b> would <b>make breaches in</b> the walls of <b>their gardens and orchards, in order to feed fallen fruit to the poor during drought years on <i>Shabbatot</i> and Festivals; and they</b> would <b>designate</b> for the poor <b>the</b> produce in the <b>corner [<i>pe’a</i>]</b> in a field <b>of vegetables. And</b> the Sages <b>reprimanded them</b> for those actions. It is clear from the <i>baraita</i> that according to Rabbi Yehuda the reaping of the grain before the <i>omer</i> offering was performed without the approval the Sages. So why does the mishna, which represents Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion, teach that it was with the approval of the Sages?

### Part 2
The Gemara responds: <b>And according to your reasoning,</b> why did the <i>baraita</i> say that the residents of Jericho performed <b>six</b> actions without the approval of the Sages? Counting the cases listed in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>there were</b> in fact <b>seven</b> actions, as reaping and piling count as two actions. Evidently, the text of the <i>baraita</i> is problematic. The Gemara concludes: <b>Rather, omit from here</b> the case of the <b>reaping</b> of the grain before the <i>omer</i> offering was brought. If so, then in the <i>baraita</i> Rabbi Yehuda never commented about the reaping of the grain before the <i>omer</i>, and therefore it does not contradict the mishna’s statement that it was performed with the approval of the Sages.

### Part 3
§ The mishna teaches: <b>One may</b> reap crops in any field <b>for fodder</b> and <b>feed it to an animal</b> even before the <i>omer</i> offering. The Gemara notes that <b>we learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Pe’a</i> 2:1): <b>And these divide</b> a field <b>for</b> the purpose of <b><i>pe’a</i>,</b> i.e., the presence of any of these separates a field so that each section constitutes a distinct field from which <i>pe’a</i> must be allocated independently: <b>A stream</b> that passes through the field, <b>and a canal [<i>vehashelulit</i>], and a private road</b> that is four cubits wide, <b>and a public road</b> that is at least sixteen cubits wide, <b>and a permanent public trail or a private trail</b> that is used <b>whether in the summer or in the rainy season,</b> i.e., winter, <b>and an uncultivated field, and a plowed field, and a seed</b> of <b>a different</b> kind of plant, e.g., a section of barley seed in a field full of wheat.

### Part 4
In all of the aforementioned instances a field is considered divided into two distinct fields. Another type of separation is subject to dispute: <b>And</b> in the case of one who <b>reaps</b> crops in a field <b>for fodder,</b> this action also <b>divides</b> a field in two. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say:</b> It <b>does not divide</b> a field <b>unless one</b> also <b>plowed</b> the area that he reaped. Only then is the field divided, as it is a plowed field.

### Part 5
With regard to the opinion of Rabbi Meir, <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Rabbi Meir said</b> his statement <b>in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, who says</b> in the mishna: <b>One may reap and feed</b> the crops to animals <b>even after they reached one-third</b> of their potential growth. <b>Apparently,</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>holds</b> that <b>any</b> reaping performed <b>for fodder is not</b> considered <b>reaping.</b> Likewise, Rabbi Meir maintains that reaping for fodder, even after the crop has reached one-third of its potential growth, is not considered the start of the reaping of the entire field, and therefore it divides the field.

### Part 6
<b>Rabba sat and stated this <i>halakha</i>. Rav Aḥa bar Huna raised an objection to Rava</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If a section of crops in a field <b>was consumed by grasshoppers,</b> or <b>ants nibbled</b> away <b>at</b> those crops <b>[<i>kirsemuha</i>],</b> or <b>the wind broke it</b> down, <b>all concede</b> that if that section was subsequently <b>plowed, it divides</b> the field, and if it was <b>not plowed, it does not divide</b> the field. When the <i>baraita</i> states: <b>All concede,</b> to <b>whom</b> is it referring? It must be referring to <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who maintains that usually, reaping for fodder divides a field without subsequent plowing, yet in this case he admits that it divides the field only if it is subsequently plowed.

### Part 7
Rav Aḥa bar Huna explains his objection to the opinion that Rabbi Meir holds in accordance with Rabbi Shimon: <b>Granted,</b> Rabbi Meir’s opinion can be explained <b>if you say</b> that <b>the mishna,</b> where Rabbi Meir maintains that reaping fodder is not considered reaping, is referring to a case <b>where</b> the fodder had <b>not</b> yet <b>reached one-third</b> of its potential growth, and the <b><i>baraita</i>, where</b> he maintains that only if it was <b>plowed, yes,</b> it divides the field, but if was <b>not plowed, no,</b> it does not divide the field, is referring to a case where the fodder had already <b>reached one-third</b> of its growth. If so, the difference between the rulings of Rabbi Meir is clear, as it all depends on the growth of the produce.

### Part 8
<b>But if you say</b> that Rabbi Meir holds in accordance with Rabbi Shimon, and <b>the mishna</b> is <b>also</b> referring to a case <b>where</b> the fodder had <b>reached one-third</b> of its growth, how can his ruling in the <i>baraita</i> be explained? <b>Now, if</b> with regard to <b>reaping there,</b> in a case where it involves human intervention, <b>Rabbi Meir said:</b> It is <b>not called reaping; here</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, where the reaping is performed by grasshoppers or ants, is it <b>not</b> clear <b>all the more so</b> that Rabbi Meir would not consider it reaping? And yet the <i>baraita</i> indicates that all agree that it is considered reaping, as it does not divide the field without plowing.

### Part 9
<b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Meir <b>stated</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, who says,</b> with regard to the statement of the first <i>tanna</i> in the mishna that one may reap fodder and feed it to an animal: <b>When [<i>eimatai</i>]</b> may one do so? <b>At a time when he began</b> reaping <b>before</b> the crop reaches <b>one-third</b> of its potential growth. <b>But if he began after</b> the crop <b>reached one-third,</b> it is <b>prohibited.</b> If so, the discrepancy between Rabbi Meir’s opinion in the mishna and in the <i>baraita</i> can be resolved, as the mishna is referring to a case where the crops had not yet reached one-third of their growth, whereas the <i>baraita</i> is speaking of crops that had already reached one-third of their growth and therefore their harvesting is considered the start of the reaping of the field, which divides it only if he subsequently plows.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: You can <b>say that you heard Rabbi Yehuda</b> express his opinion with regard to fodder that is reaped for the purposes of feeding an animal, but <b>did you hear him</b> say so with regard to a case where the reaping is performed <b>for human</b> consumption? <b>That</b> cannot be his opinion, since <b>if</b> it were <b>so,</b> then <b>there would be three</b> disputing opinions among the <b><i>tanna’im</i>:</b> The opinion of the first <i>tanna</i>, who holds that reaping fodder for animal consumption is permitted; the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, who maintains that it may be reaped even for human consumption provided that it has not grown one-third; and the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, who holds that it is permitted for human consumption even in a case where it had grown one-third. This is problematic, as the Gemara in tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i> (25a) states a principle that whenever Rabbi Yehuda says in a mishna: When [<i>eimatai</i>], he is clarifying, rather than disagreeing with, the opinion of the previous <i>tanna</i>.

### Part 11
<b>Rather, when Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael <b>he said: Rabbi Meir stated</b> his opinion in accordance <b>with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva, his teacher.</b> Rabbi Akiva holds that <b>even</b> harvesting <b>for human</b> consumption <b>is not</b> considered <b>reaping</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>pe’a</i>, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Pe’a</i> 3:2): With regard to <b>one who</b> reaps <b>alternate</b> rows of his <b>field, and he leaves in it moist stems</b> that are not yet fully grown, <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> One must separate <b><i>pe’a</i> in each and every</b> row, as each one is considered a separate field.

### Part 12
<b>And the Rabbis say:</b> One separates <i>pe’a</i> <b>from one</b> row <b>for the whole</b> field, as they are all considered a single field. <b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: Rabbi Akiva</b> maintained that one is <b>obligated</b> to separate <i>pe’a</i> from each row <b>only when</b> he reaps <b>alternate</b> rows and the grain is unripe kernels used <b>for</b> making <b>roasted grains. But when</b> one reaps <b>alternate</b> rows and the grain is fully grown produce <b>for</b> his <b>storehouse,</b> there is <b>no</b> obligation to separate <i>pe’a</i> from each row, as all the rows are considered part of one field. Rav Dimi is suggesting that Rabbi Meir holds in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva, and therefore the discrepancy between the mishna and the <i>baraita</i> can be resolved: The mishna is discussing unripe grains that have not yet grown one-third, similar to unripe kernels used for roasted grains, whereas the <i>baraita</i> is discussing fully grown, ripened grains.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia he reported that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Rabbi Akiva deems</b> one <b>obligated</b> in the separation of <i>pe’a</i> from each row <b>even where</b> he reaped fully grown fodder in <b>alternative</b> sections of his field <b>for</b> the purposes of storing in <b>a storehouse.</b> According to Ravin, Rabbi Akiva holds that reaping even fully grown fodder is not considered the start of the entire field’s reaping process, but only of the individual row. Therefore, one must separate <i>pe’a</i> from each row. This is inconsistent with Rabbi Meir’s opinion that the harvesting of fodder that has grown one-third is considered reaping.
