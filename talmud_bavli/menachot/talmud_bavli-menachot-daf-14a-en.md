### Part 1
<b>But if you say</b> that Rabbi Yosei holds that the right and left thighs of an offering <b>are</b> considered <b>two</b> distinct <b>bodies,</b> and therefore <i>piggul</i> intent with regard to one does not render the other <i>piggul</i>, then in the case of the two loaves, <b>would</b> the intentions concerning both loaves <b>combine</b> to render them both <i>piggul</i>?

### Part 2
Rav Huna responds: One cannot infer anything from this <i>baraita</i> with regard to the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, as in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>as it is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who slaughters</b> one of <b>the lambs</b> brought as peace offerings on <i>Shavuot</i> with the intent <b>to consume half an olive-bulk from this loaf</b>  the next day, <b>and similarly,</b> he slaughtered <b>the other</b> lamb with the intent <b>to consume half an olive-bulk from that</b> second <b>loaf</b> the next day, <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: I say that this</b> offering is <b>valid,</b> as his intentions do not combine.

### Part 3
Rav Huna continues: It may be inferred that <b>the reason</b> why the priest’s intentions do not combine is <b>that</b> his intent was <b>said</b> with regard to <b>a half</b> and <b>a half,</b> i.e., he slaughtered each lamb with the intent to consume half an olive-bulk from one loaf the next day. <b>But</b> if he <b>said</b> during the slaughter of each of the lambs that he is slaughtering it with the intent to consume <b>an olive-bulk from both of them,</b> then the halves <b>combine</b> to render the offering <i>piggul</i>.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, who says that the two loaves are <i>piggul</i> only if he has intent with regard to an amount equal to an olive-bulk from both of them combined, <b>in accordance with whose</b> opinion is his statement? <b>If</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis</b> of the mishna, who hold that <i>piggul</i> intent with regard to one loaf renders both loaves <i>piggul</i>, then <b>even</b> if his intent was <b>with regard to</b> only <b>one of them,</b> both loaves should be <i>piggul</i>. And <b>if</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yosei,</b> who holds that <i>piggul</i> intent with regard to one loaf does not render the second loaf <i>piggul</i>, then <b>our difficulty returns to its place:</b> If Rabbi Yosei holds that the right and left thighs are considered two distinct bodies, how can intentions with regard to two halves of an olive-bulk combine to render both loaves <i>piggul</i>?

### Part 5
The Gemara responds: <b>Actually,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s statement is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis. And do not say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> states: It is not <i>piggul</i> <b>unless one has</b> the <b>intent of <i>piggul</i> with regard to both of them [<i>bishteihen</i>],</b> in the feminine form, whereby the <i>baraita</i> would be referring to the loaves. <b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> states: <b>With regard to both of them [<i>bishneihen</i>],</b> in the masculine form, i.e., unless he slaughters both lambs with <i>piggul</i> intent, <b>and</b> in such a case, <b>even</b> if his intent was with regard to only <b>one of the</b> loaves, the offering is <i>piggul</i>.

### Part 6
The Gemara adds: <b>And</b> this <i>baraita</i> serves <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir, who says</b> in the mishna on 16a: <b>One renders</b> an offering <b><i>piggul</i></b> by means of intent during the sacrifice <b>of half a permitting factor,</b> e.g., if one slaughtered one of the lambs with the intent to consume the two loaves the next day, the loaves are <i>piggul</i>. This <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us that</b> this is <b>not</b> the <i>halakha</i>.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> then <b>what</b> is the meaning of the emphasis in the <i>baraita</i>: There is <b>never</b> liability? <b>Granted,</b> this phrase is understandable <b>if you say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> means that the loaves are not <i>piggul</i> unless he has intent <b>with regard to both of the</b> loaves <b>and both of the</b> lambs, i.e., they are <i>piggul</i> only if he slaughters both lambs with the intention to partake of both loaves the next day. In that case the <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, and it comes to exclude</b> the statements <b>of</b> both <b>Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis,</b> and <b>this is</b> the reason <b>that</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>states:</b> There is <b>never</b> liability, to emphasize that Rabbi Yosei disagrees with both of these opinions.

### Part 8
<b>But if you say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis and</b> that it serves <b>to exclude</b> only the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir,</b> for <b>what</b> reason does the <i>baraita</i> stress: There is <b>never</b> liability? The <i>tanna</i> would not use such a word to exclude merely one opinion. Rather, it must be that the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei. If so, then the difficulty raised against Rav Huna, who says that <i>piggul</i> intent concerning the right thigh does not render the left one <i>piggul</i>, remains unresolved.

### Part 9
<b>And furthermore, didn’t Rav Ashi say: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a refutation of the opinion of Rav Huna from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says in the name of Rabbi Yosei</b> that if, while performing the sacrificial rites for the bulls or goats which are burned as an offering, the priest had an intention that can <b>render</b> the offering <b><i>piggul</i> with regard to a matter that is performed outside</b> the Sanctuary, i.e., in the Temple courtyard, <b>he has rendered</b> the offering <b><i>piggul</i>.</b> If his intention was <b>with regard to a matter that is performed inside</b> the Sanctuary or the Holy of Holies, <b>he has not rendered</b> the offering <b><i>piggul</i>.</b>

### Part 10
The <i>baraita</i> elaborates: <b>How so?</b> If <b>he was standing outside</b> when slaughtering the animal <b>and said: I hereby slaughter</b> the animal <b>with the intention of sprinkling its blood tomorrow</b> inside the Sanctuary, <b>he has not rendered</b> the offering <b><i>piggul</i>.</b> The reason is <b>that</b> when one has <b>an intention outside with regard to a matter that is performed inside,</b> he has not rendered the offering <i>piggul</i>. Likewise, if he <b>was standing inside</b> when sprinkling, <b>and said: I hereby sprinkle</b> the blood of the sin offering <b>in order to burn</b> its <b>sacrificial portions</b> on the external altar <b>tomorrow and to pour out</b> its <b>remainder</b> on the base of the altar <b>tomorrow, he has not rendered</b> the offering <b><i>piggul</i>, as</b> he had <b>an intention inside with regard to a matter that is performed outside.</b>

### Part 11
<b>But</b> if <b>he was standing outside and said: I hereby slaughter</b> the animal <b>with the intention to pour out</b> the <b>remainder</b> of its blood <b>tomorrow, or to burn</b> its <b>sacrificial portions tomorrow, he has rendered</b> the offering <b><i>piggul</i>, as</b> he had <b>an intention outside with regard to a matter that is performed outside.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara analyzes this <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the case where one slaughtered the offering with the intent <b>to pour the remaining</b> blood the next day, <b>what could be rendered <i>piggul</i>? If we say</b> the <b>blood could be rendered <i>piggul</i>,</b> one can ask: <b>Does blood become <i>piggul</i>? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Zevaḥim</i> 42b): <b>These are</b> the <b>items for which one is not liable</b> to receive <i>karet</i> <b>due to</b> the prohibition of <b><i>piggul</i>: The handful; the frankincense; the incense; the meal offering of priests; the meal offering</b> accompanying the <b>libations</b> brought with an animal offering; <b>the meal offering of</b> the <b>anointed priest; and the blood?</b>

### Part 13
<b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that the <i>baraita</i> means that it is the <b>meat</b> of the offering that <b>could be rendered <i>piggul</i>. Now</b> consider: <b>And if there,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>where he did not have intent with regard to the meat itself,</b> as his intention was not to partake of the meat the next day but to pour the remaining blood the next day, and yet <b>Rabbi Yosei said</b> that the meat <b>is rendered <i>piggul</i>;</b> then <b>here, where he has intent</b> to partake of the right thigh the next day, which is part <b>of the offering itself,</b> is it <b>not all the more so that</b> if <b>he had intent of <i>piggul</i> with regard to the right thigh, he has rendered the left thigh <i>piggul</i></b> as well?

### Part 14
<b>And furthermore, doesn’t Ravina say: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a refutation of the statement of Rav Huna from the mishna (13a): In the case of <b>one who removes a handful from the meal offering</b> with the intent <b>to partake of its remainder or to burn its handful</b> on <b>the next day, Rabbi Yosei concedes in this</b> instance <b>that he has rendered</b> the offering <b><i>piggul</i> and he is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> partaking of <b>it.</b>

### Part 15
Ravina continues: When one removes the handful with the intent <b>to burn its handful, what could be rendered <i>piggul</i>? If we say</b> that <b>the handful could be rendered <i>piggul</i>, does the handful become <i>piggul</i>? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Zevaḥim</i> 42b): <b>These are</b> the <b>items for which one is not liable</b> to receive <i>karet</i> <b>due to</b> the prohibition of <b><i>piggul</i>: The handful, etc. Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that the <b>remainder could be rendered <i>piggul</i>. Now</b> consider: <b>And if there,</b> in the mishna, <b>where he did not have intent with regard to</b> the <b>remainder itself,</b> i.e., to partake of the remainder the next day,
