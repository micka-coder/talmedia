### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who</b> takes a vow to bring a meal offering to the Temple and <b>says: It is</b> incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring a meal offering prepared <b>in a <i>maḥavat</i>, may not bring</b> one prepared <b>in a <i>marḥeshet</i>.</b> Similarly, if he says: It is incumbent upon me to bring a meal offering prepared <b>in a <i>marḥeshet</i>, he may not bring</b> one prepared <b>in a <i>maḥavat</i>.</b> The mishna clarifies: <b>What is</b> the difference <b>between a <i>maḥavat</i> and a <i>marḥeshet</i>? A <i>marḥeshet</i> has a cover,</b> whereas <b>a <i>maḥavat</i> does not have a cover;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili. Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel says: A <i>marḥeshet</i> is deep, and</b> due to the large amount of oil, <b>its product</b> is soft because it <b>moves about [<i>roḥashin</i>]</b> in the oil. <b>A <i>maḥavat</i></b> is flat, as the sides of the pan are <b>level</b> with the pan, <b>and</b> due to the small amount of oil, <b>its product is hard.</b>

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara inquires: As the Torah does not describe the different vessels, <b>what is the reason for</b> the interpretation of <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> HaGelili, explaining that a <i>marḥeshet</i> has a cover and a <i>maḥavat</i> does not have a cover? <b>If we say</b> that the term <b><i>marḥeshet</i></b> indicates <b>that</b> the offering <b>comes</b> to atone <b>for</b> the sinful <b>musings [<i>raḥashei</i>] of the heart, as it is written: “My heart muses [<i>raḥash</i>] on a goodly matter”</b> (Psalms 45:2), and therefore this meal offering must be prepared in a covered vessel just as the thoughts of the heart are hidden, this interpretation is insufficient. <b>And</b> if we say that the term <b><i>maḥavat</i></b> indicates <b>that</b> the offering <b>comes</b> to atone <b>for</b> transgressions committed with the <b>corners of [<i>ammaḥavo’ei</i>] the mouth, as people say</b> with regard to someone who speaks loudly: He <b>is barking [<i>minbaḥ nevuḥei</i>],</b> and therefore this meal offering must be prepared in an open vessel, this interpretation is also insufficient.

### Part 3
The reason these interpretations are insufficient is that one can also <b>say the opposite,</b> and suggest that the name <b><i>maḥavat</i></b> indicates that the offering must be prepared in a closed vessel, <b>as it comes</b> to atone <b>for the secret</b> musings <b>of the heart, as it is written</b> that Laban said to Jacob: <b>“Why did you flee secretly [<i>naḥbeita</i>]”</b> (Genesis 31:27). Likewise, with regard to <b><i>marḥeshet</i>,</b> one can say that it must be prepared in an open vessel, <b>as it comes</b> to atone <b>for whispers [<i>reḥushei</i>]</b> of the mouth which are heard and revealed, <b>as people say: His lips were whispering [<i>meraḥashan</i>].</b> Therefore, Rabbi Yosei HaGelili cannot derive the meanings of the terms <i>marḥeshet</i> and <i>maḥavat</i> from the verses; <b>rather,</b> his interpretation <b>is learned as a tradition.</b>

### Part 4
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel says</b> that a <i>marḥeshet</i> is deep, whereas a <i>maḥavat</i> is flat. The Gemara explains the reason for this opinion: <b>A <i>marḥeshet</i></b> is <b>deep, as it is written</b> with regard to this meal offering: <b>“And all that is made in the <i>marḥeshet</i>”</b> (Leviticus 7:9). The use of the term “in” indicates that this meal offering is prepared inside a vessel, i.e., a deep container. Conversely, <b>a <i>maḥavat</i></b> is flat, with the sides of the pan <b>level</b> with the pan, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to this meal offering: <b>“And on the <i>maḥavat</i>”</b> (Leviticus 7:9). The use of the term “on” indicates that it is prepared on the vessel, not inside it. Therefore, a flat vessel is required.

### Part 5
§ The mishna teaches that if one vows: It is incumbent upon me to bring a meal offering prepared in a <i>marḥeshet</i>, he is obligated to bring a meal offering of that type. With regard to this, <b>the Sages taught</b> that <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> With regard to <b>one who says: It is</b> incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a <i>marḥeshet</i>,</b> without using the term: Meal offering, or the preposition: In, in such a case the money for the meal offering <b>should be placed</b> in a safe place <b>until</b> the prophet <b>Elijah comes</b> heralding the Messiah, and clarifies what should be done.

### Part 6
The Gemara elaborates: Beit Shammai <b>are uncertain</b> with regard to the source of the terms <i>marḥeshet</i> and <i>maḥavat</i>, <b>whether</b> the offerings <b>are called</b> these names <b>due to</b> the specific <b>vessel</b> in which each meal offering is prepared, <b>or</b> whether they are called these names <b>due to</b> the manner of <b>their preparation.</b> The significance of this distinction is that if the term <i>marḥeshet</i> is referring to a specific type of vessel, then if one takes a vow: It is incumbent upon me to bring a <i>marḥeshet</i>, he must bring an actual vessel of that type, whereas if the term is referring to the manner of preparation of the meal offering then he is obligated to bring that type of meal offering. Since Beit Shammai are uncertain which is the correct interpretation, they rule that he must wait until the prophet Elijah comes.

### Part 7
<b>And Beit Hillel say</b> that there is no uncertainty about this matter, as <b>there was</b> a particular <b>vessel in the Temple, and its name</b> was <b><i>marḥeshet</i>. And</b> this vessel <b>resembled a type of deep <i>kelabus</i>,</b> which is a vessel with indentations, <b>and when dough is placed inside it,</b> it gets pressed against the indentations and takes their shape. The dough <b>resembles a type of apple of <i>berotim</i></b> trees, <b>or a type of acorn [<i>balutei</i>]</b> of <b>the Greek</b> oak trees. Therefore, one who takes a vow: It is incumbent upon me to bring a <i>marḥeshet</i>, must bring this type of vessel to the Temple as a donation.

### Part 8
<b>And</b> the verse <b>states</b> two different prepositions with regard to these vessels: <b>“And all that is made in the <i>marḥeshet</i> and on the <i>maḥavat</i>”</b> (Leviticus 7:9). It does not state simply: And all that is made in the <i>marḥeshet</i> and the <i>maḥavat</i>. Since it seems from the verse that when using the <i>marḥeshet</i> the meal offering is prepared inside the vessel and when using the <i>maḥavat</i> it is prepared on the vessel, <b>evidently they are called</b> these names <b>due to</b> the <b>vessel</b> in which the meal offering is prepared, <b>not due to</b> the manner of <b>their preparation.</b>

### Part 9
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one says: <b>It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring a meal offering baked <b>in an oven, he may not bring</b> a meal offering <b>baked</b> on <b>a small oven [<i>kupaḥ</i>], nor a</b> meal offering <b>baked</b> on roofing <b>tiles, nor</b> a meal offering <b>baked</b> in the baking <b>pits</b> of <b>the Arabs. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If he so <b>wishes,</b> he may <b>bring</b> a meal offering <b>baked</b> on <b>a <i>kupaḥ</i>.</b>

### Part 10
If one says: <b>It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a baked meal offering,</b> without specifying loaves or wafers, <b>he may not bring half</b> the required offering in the form of <b>loaves and</b> the other <b>half</b> in the form of <b>wafers;</b> rather, they must all be of one form or the other. <b>Rabbi Shimon deems</b> this <b>permitted, due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> both loaves and wafers are written with regard to this meal offering, which indicates that <b>it is one offering</b> of two possible forms.

### Part 11
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When the verse states: “And when you bring a meal offering <b>baked in an oven”</b> (Leviticus 2:4), this emphasizes that it must be prepared in an oven, <b>and not baked</b> on <b>a <i>kupaḥ</i>, nor baked</b> on roofing <b>tiles, nor baked</b> in the baking <b>pits</b> of <b>the Arabs,</b> in accordance with the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i> in the mishna.

### Part 12
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> In this verse it states <b>“oven,”</b> and it also states <b>“oven”</b> in another verse: “And every meal offering that is baked in the oven” (Leviticus 7:9). Since it is written <b>two times,</b> and these terms are restrictions, one follows the hermeneutical principle that a restrictive expression following a restrictive expression serves only to amplify the <i>halakha</i> and include additional cases. Consequently, this derivation serves <b>to render fit</b> a meal offering <b>baked</b> on <b>a <i>kupaḥ</i>,</b> and it too is deemed an oven. <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The terms <b>“oven”</b> and <b>“oven,”</b> which are written a total of <b>two times,</b> serve to teach two <i>halakhot</i>: <b>One</b> instance teaches <b>that their baking should be in an oven, and</b> the other <b>one</b> teaches <b>that their consecration is in an oven,</b> i.e., meal offerings are not consecrated in service vessels but rather in the oven.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Shimon hold</b> in accordance with <b>this</b> line of <b>reasoning? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (95b) that <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> One should <b>always be accustomed to say</b> that <b>the two loaves and the shewbread are valid</b> if they are kneaded, shaped, or baked <b>in</b> the Temple <b>courtyard, and</b> that they <b>are</b> also <b>valid</b> if they are prepared <b>in</b> the place called <b>Beit Pagei,</b> which is outside the walls of the Temple Mount? As these offerings are not disqualified by being taken outside the Temple, evidently they are not consecrated in the oven.

### Part 14
<b>Rava said</b> in response: Rabbi Shimon maintains that the oven does not consecrate meal offerings, and as for his statement in the <i>baraita</i> concerning the two derivations, one should <b>say</b> that the other derivation from the term “oven” teaches <b>that their consecration</b> by the owner <b>must be</b> explicit, i.e., from the outset he must say that he is sanctifying his meal offering <b>for the sake</b> of a meal offering baked in <b>an oven.</b>

### Part 15
§ The mishna teaches that if one says: <b>It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a baked meal offering, he may not bring half</b> the required offering in the form of loaves and half in the form of wafers, whereas Rabbi Shimon deems this permitted, as it is one offering. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And when you bring a meal offering baked in an oven” (Leviticus 2:4). The phrase: <b>“And when you bring,”</b> indicates that this offering is not obligatory. Rather, <b>when you</b> wish you may <b>bring,</b> i.e., the verse teaches how <b>to perform</b> the meal offering baked in an oven as <b>a voluntary matter.</b>

### Part 16
With regard to the term: <b>“A meal offering,” Rabbi Yehuda says: From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to one who says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a baked meal offering, that he must not bring half</b> of the bread in the form of <b>loaves and half</b> in the form of <b>wafers? The verse states: “A meal offering,”</b> which indicates: <b>I told you</b> to bring <b>one offering,</b> i.e., all ten loaves from one type, <b>and not two or three offerings</b> of different types, as allowed by Rabbi Shimon.

### Part 17
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Shimon said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda:
