### Part 1
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> isn’t there the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood, <b>concerning which only</b> the <b>priesthood is written</b> in the verse, <b>and we learned:</b> If <b>one sprinkled</b> the blood <b>with</b> his <b>left</b> hand it is <b>disqualified; and Rabbi Shimon does not disagree</b> with this ruling, indicating that Rabbi Shimon holds that a mention of the priesthood does not require a mention of the word finger? <b>Abaye says: He disagrees</b> with this ruling <b>in a <i>baraita</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one collected</b> the blood <b>with</b> his <b>left</b> hand it is <b>disqualified, and Rabbi Shimon deems</b> it <b>fit.</b> Additionally, if <b>one sprinkled</b> the blood <b>with</b> his <b>left</b> hand it is <b>disqualified, and Rabbi Shimon deems</b> it <b>fit.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>But that which Rava says</b> with regard to the superfluous terms in the passage discussing a leper: One derives a verbal analogy between the word <b>“hand”</b> written in that passage and the word <b>“hand”</b> written <b>with regard to the removal of a handful</b> from a meal offering, to indicate that the latter must also be performed with the right hand, <b>why do I</b> need this verbal analogy? One can <b>derive</b> that the handful must be removed with the right hand <b>from</b> the verse’s mention of the <b>priesthood,</b> as it is stated: “And the priest shall remove his handful” (Leviticus 5:12).

### Part 3
The Gemara responds: Both derivations are necessary, <b>one for</b> the removal of the <b>handful</b> from a meal offering, <b>and one for the sanctification of</b> the <b>handful,</b> i.e., placing it into a second service vessel. Both must be performed with the right hand.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Rabbi Shimon, who does not require sanctification of</b> the <b>handful, or according to the one who says that Rabbi Shimon also requires the sanctification of</b> the <b>handful but</b> that <b>he deems</b> the sanctification <b>fit</b> when performed <b>with</b> the <b>left</b> hand (see 26a), <b>why do I</b> need the verbal analogy <b>of Rava</b> between <b>“hand”</b> and <b>“hand”?</b>

### Part 5
<b>If</b> one suggests that it is necessary <b>to</b> indicate that the <b>removal of the handful itself</b> must be performed with the right hand, this cannot be, since this is <b>derived from</b> the verse cited by <b>Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya. As Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, says: What is the reason that Rabbi Shimon</b> does not require that the handful be sanctified in a service vessel? <b>As the verse states</b> with regard to the meal offering: <b>“It is most holy, as the sin offering, and as the guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:10).

### Part 6
Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, elaborates: The verse compares the meal offering to a sin offering and a guilt offering. Therefore, if the priest <b>comes to perform</b> the burning of the handful <b>with</b> his <b>hand, he performs it with</b> his <b>right</b> hand, <b>like</b> in the case of <b>a sin offering,</b> whose blood is sprinkled with the hand. And if he <b>comes to perform it with a vessel,</b> i.e., if he first sanctifies the handful in a service vessel, then <b>he</b> may <b>perform it with</b> his <b>left</b> hand, <b>like</b> in the case of <b>a guilt offering,</b> whose blood is sprinkled from a vessel. Since the removal of the handful is performed with the hand, the verse indicates that it must be performed with the right hand, and the verbal analogy is unnecessary.

### Part 7
The Gemara responds: The verbal analogy <b>is necessary only for the handful of the meal offering of a sinner,</b> to teach that it must be removed with the right hand. It might <b>enter your mind to say: Since Rabbi Shimon says</b> that this offering does not require oil and frankincense <b>so that</b> a sinner’s <b>offering will not be of superior quality,</b> perhaps <b>when</b> the priest <b>removed the handful with</b> his <b>left</b> hand, which is a manner of inferior quality, <b>it should be fit as well.</b> The verbal analogy therefore <b>teaches us</b> that the handful must always be removed with the right hand, even in the case of the meal offering of a sinner.

### Part 8
§ The mishna teaches: If a priest <b>removed the handful</b> of flour, <b>and a stone or a grain of salt emerged in his hand,</b>
