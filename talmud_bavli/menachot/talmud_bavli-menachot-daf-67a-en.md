### Part 1
Rava adds: The <b>kneading</b> of <b>consecrated</b> dough <b>exempts</b> it from the obligation of <i>ḥalla</i>, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ḥalla</i> 3:3): If a woman <b>consecrated her dough before she kneaded</b> it <b>and she</b> subsequently <b>redeemed it, she is obligated</b> to separate <i>ḥalla</i>. Likewise, if <b>she</b> consecrated it <b>after she kneaded</b> it <b>and</b> then <b>she redeemed it, she is obligated</b> to separate <i>ḥalla</i>. But if <b>she consecrated</b> the dough <b>before she kneaded</b> it <b>and</b> the Temple <b>treasurer</b> kneaded <b>it and</b> then <b>she subsequently redeemed it, she is exempt.</b> The reason is that <b>at the time</b> that <b>its obligation</b> in <i>ḥalla</i> would have taken effect, i.e., at the time of its kneading, <b>it was exempt,</b> because it was Temple property.

### Part 2
<b>Rava raises a dilemma:</b> If dough was <b>kneaded</b> while in the possession of <b>a gentile, what</b> is its status? Is one who acquires it after it has been kneaded obligated to separate <i>ḥalla</i> from it or not? The Gemara answers that this <b>is taught</b> explicitly, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ḥalla</i> 3:6): With regard to <b>a convert who converted and had dough</b> in <b>his</b> possession, if it was <b>prepared before he converted,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from the obligation of <i>ḥalla</i>. If it was prepared <b>after he converted,</b> he is <b>obligated.</b> If he is <b>uncertain,</b> he is <b>obligated.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: Of the Sages who disagreed with regard to the obligation to tithe grain that is smoothed by a gentile, <b>who taught this</b> mishna with regard to <i>ḥalla</i>? Perhaps <b>it</b> is a ruling upon which <b>everyone agrees, and even Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda, who obligate there,</b> in the case of tithes, <b>exempt here</b> in the case of <i>ḥalla</i>.

### Part 4
The Gemara explains this possibility. There are three verses written with regard to <i>teruma</i> that contain the term “your grain.” They are: “You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain” (Deuteronomy 12:17); “And you shall eat before the Lord your God…the tithe of your grain” (Deuteronomy 12:17); and “The first fruits of your grain…you shall give him” (Deuteronomy 18:4). It can therefore be claimed that only <b>there</b> Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda hold that one is obligated to separate tithes from grain that was owned by a gentile, <b>as</b> in addition to the first reference to “your grain,” which excludes grain that was smoothed while in the Temple’s possession, <b>it is written an additional “your grain,”</b> and then another reference to <b>“your grain.”</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara elaborates: This <b>is</b> an example of <b>a restrictive expression following a restrictive expression. And</b> there is a hermeneutical principle that <b>a restrictive expression following a restrictive expression comes only to include</b> additional cases. In this case, the verses teach that <b>even</b> grain that belonged to <b>gentiles</b> is obligated in the separation of tithes.

### Part 6
<b>But here,</b> with regard to the obligation to separate <i>ḥalla</i>, the term <b>“your dough” is written</b> only <b>twice:</b> “Of the first of your dough you shall set apart a cake for a gift; as that which is set apart of the threshing floor, so shall you set it apart. Of the first of your dough you shall give to the Lord a portion for a gift throughout your generations” (Numbers 15:20–21). <b>One</b> reference to <b>“your dough”</b> teaches that one is obligated to separate <i>ḥalla</i> only from an amount <b>equal to your dough</b> in the wilderness, where the mitzva was commanded, i.e., the volume of one <i>omer</i>. <b>And one</b> reference to <b>“your dough”</b> teaches that only the dough of an ordinary Jew is obligated <b>but not the dough of gentiles nor the dough of consecrated</b> property.

### Part 7
The Gemara continues: <b>Or perhaps</b> it is <b>Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon</b> who <b>taught</b> that mishna, <b>as they</b> maintain that grain that was smoothed by a gentile owner is exempt from the obligation to separate tithes, and likewise dough kneaded by a gentile owner is likewise <b>exempt</b> from the obligation to separate <i>ḥalla</i>. <b>But Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda derive</b> by way of verbal analogy the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <i>ḥalla</i>, concerning which it is written: “Of <b>the first</b> of your dough,” <b>from</b> the same expression that appears <b>there,</b> with regard to tithes: <b>“The first</b> fruits of your grain.” Just as in the case of tithes they hold that one is obligated to separate the tithes from a pile of grain that was smoothed by a gentile owner, so too they hold that one is obligated to separate <i>ḥalla</i> from dough that was kneaded by a gentile owner.

### Part 8
<b>Rava said: May it be</b> God’s <b>will that I see</b> the answer to my question <b>in a dream. Rava then said: The one who says</b> that the <b>smoothing of</b> a grain pile by its <b>gentile</b> owner <b>exempts</b> a future Jewish owner from the obligation to separate tithes also maintains that the <b>kneading of</b> dough by its <b>gentile</b> owner <b>exempts</b> a future Jewish owner from any obligation to separate <i>ḥalla</i>. So too <b>the one who says</b> that the <b>smoothing of</b> a grain pile by a <b>gentile</b> owner <b>does not exempt</b> a future Jewish owner from the obligation to separate tithes also maintains that the <b>kneading</b> of dough by a <b>gentile</b> owner <b>does not exempt</b> a future Jewish owner from the obligation to separate <i>ḥalla</i>.

### Part 9
<b>Rav Pappa raised an objection to Rava</b> from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Terumot</i> 4:13): With regard to <b>a gentile who separated</b> a lamb in order to redeem <b>a firstborn donkey, or</b> if he separated <b><i>ḥalla</i></b> from dough that he kneaded, <b>one informs him that he is exempt</b> from these obligations <b>and his <i>ḥalla</i></b> may be <b>eaten by non-priests and</b> the lamb designated to redeem his <b>firstborn donkey</b> may be <b>sheared and worked.</b>

### Part 10
One can infer: <b>But</b> if a gentile separated <i>teruma</i>, the portion of the produce designated for the priest, from a grain pile that he smoothed, <b>his <i>teruma</i></b> is <b>prohibited</b> to a non-priest. <b>And this</b> is an example of <b>a <i>tanna</i> who says:</b> The <b>smoothing</b> of a grain pile <b>by a gentile</b> owner <b>does not exempt it</b> from tithes, as the same <i>halakhot</i> apply to tithes as to <i>teruma</i>, <b>and</b> yet he maintains that the <b>kneading</b> of dough by <b>a gentile</b> owner <b>exempts</b> it from the obligation to separate <i>ḥalla</i>. This refutes Rava’s conclusion that one who holds that there is an exemption in the case of tithes likewise holds that an exemption applies to <i>ḥalla</i>.

### Part 11
<b>And Ravina further raised an objection to Rava</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b><i>ḥalla</i> of a gentile</b> that he separated after kneading his dough <b>in Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>or his <i>teruma</i></b> that he separated after smoothing his pile of grain <b>outside Eretz</b> Yisrael, in both cases <b>one informs him that he is exempt</b> from those obligations and <b>his <i>ḥalla</i></b> may be <b>eaten by non-priests and his <i>teruma</i> does not render a mixture</b> prohibited if it becomes mixed with non-sacred produce. One can infer: <b>But his <i>teruma</i></b> from his grain <b>in Eretz</b> Yisrael is <b>prohibited</b> to non-priests <b>and renders a mixture</b> prohibited if it becomes mixed with non-sacred produce.

### Part 12
The Gemara explains the objection: <b>And</b> again <b>this</b> is an example of <b>a <i>tanna</i> who says:</b> The <b>smoothing</b> of a grain pile <b>by a gentile</b> owner <b>does not exempt it</b> from tithes, and nevertheless he maintains that the <b>kneading</b> of dough <b>by a gentile</b> owner <b>exempts</b> it from the obligation to separate <i>ḥalla</i>.

### Part 13
The Gemara answers: This ruling that the smoothing of a grain pile by its gentile owner does not exempt it from the obligations of <i>teruma</i> and tithes applies only <b>by rabbinic law.</b> By Torah law, the smoothing of a grain pile by its gentile owner does exempt it from the obligation to separate <i>teruma</i> and tithes. The Sages enacted <b>a decree due to</b> the schemes of <b>people of means.</b> There was a fear that conniving merchants might temporarily transfer ownership of their produce to gentiles while the piles were smoothed, after which the gentiles would return them to their possession, thereby circumventing the obligation to separate <i>teruma</i> and tithes.
