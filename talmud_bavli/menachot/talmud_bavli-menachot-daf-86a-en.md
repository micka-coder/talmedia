### Part 1
<b>but if one did bring</b> a meal offering made of such oil, <b>it is not valid. But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that if one did bring it, it is valid, <b>because it is</b> regarded merely as <b>sap</b> and not as oil? This contradicts this mishna, which assumes that it is regarded as oil.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Yosef said:</b> It is <b>not difficult</b> to resolve this contradiction. <b>This</b> <i>baraita</i> expresses the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> and <b>that</b> mishna expresses the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>As Rabbi Ḥiyya would toss</b> such oil <b>away,</b> as he did not consider it to be oil, <b>and Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>would dip</b> his food into it, as he considered it to be oil. The Gemara concludes: <b>And your mnemonic</b> by which to remember their respective opinions is: The <b>wealthy are parsimonious,</b> i.e., Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, was wealthy, and he did not toss the oil away.

### Part 3
§ The Gemara digresses to discuss oil of myrrh: In describing the treatments provided to the women in preparation for their meeting with King Ahasuerus, the verse states: “For so were the days of their anointing accomplished: <b>Six months with oil of myrrh,</b> and six months with sweet odors and with other ointments of the women” (Esther 2:12). The Gemara asks: <b>What is “oil of myrrh”? Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya says:</b> It is the aromatic oil called <b><i>setakhta</i>. Rav Yirmeya bar Abba says:</b> It is <b>an oil</b> derived <b>from olives that have not</b> yet <b>reached one-third</b> of their growth; the acidic oil is effective as a depilatory.

### Part 4
The Gemara notes: <b>This</b> explanation of Rav Yirmeya bar Abba <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The term <b><i>anpikanon</i></b> is referring to <b>olive oil</b> produced from olives <b>that have not</b> yet <b>reached one-third</b> of their growth. And <b>why do</b> women <b>spread it</b> on their bodies? They do so <b>because it removes the hair and pampers the skin.</b>

### Part 5
§ The mishna teaches: <b>One may not bring</b> meal offerings containing oil <b>from olives that were soaked in water,</b> nor from pickled olives, nor from boiled olives, and even if one did bring it, it is not valid. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Olive oil</b> produced from <b>pickled</b> olives, <b>boiled</b> olives, or olives <b>soaked</b> in water, <b>and</b> oil made <b>from</b> olive <b>sediment, and</b> oil <b>with a foul odor may not be brought</b> as part of a meal offering, <b>and</b> even <b>if one did bring</b> it, it is <b>not valid.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rava asks:</b> If one <b>consecrated</b> one of these unfit oils for use in meal offerings, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to whether <b>he should be flogged for</b> consecrating <b>it due to</b> the prohibition against consecrating <b>a flawed</b> item as an offering? Does one say that <b>since it</b> is <b>unfit,</b> it is <b>comparable to a blemished</b> animal? <b>Or perhaps</b> the prohibition against consecrating <b>a flawed</b> item <b>applies only to an animal.</b> The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 7
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>There are three</b> harvests of <b>olives</b> each year, <b>and in each</b> of <b>them, three</b> different grades of <b>oils</b> are produced.

### Part 8
How is <b>the first olive</b> harvest processed? <b>One picks</b> the ripe olives <b>at the top of the olive</b> tree, as those are the first to ripen, <b>and crushes</b> them in a mortar <b>and places</b> them <b>inside</b> the bottom of a wicker <b>basket</b> that has many small holes in it. The oil will then drip from the olives through those holes into a vessel placed underneath the basket. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> One positions the olives on the walls, <b>surrounding the basket.</b> This produces more refined oil, as the dregs stick to the walls of the basket. <b>This is the first</b> grade of oil produced from the first harvest.

### Part 9
After the oil ceases to seep from the crushed olives, <b>one then presses down with</b> a wooden <b>beam</b> upon them, causing additional oil to flow from the basket into the vessel. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The excessive pressure produced by pressing down with a beam would cause some of the flesh of the olives to get mixed in with the oil, compromising its quality. Rather, one applies pressure <b>by</b> placing <b>stones</b> upon the olives. <b>This is the second</b> grade of oil.

### Part 10
<b>One then ground</b> the olives with a millstone <b>and pressed down</b> with a beam on those olives to extract any remaining oil; <b>this is the third</b> grade of oil.

### Part 11
<b>The first</b> grade is fit <b>for</b> kindling <b>the Candelabrum,</b> which requires: “Refined olive oil” (Leviticus 24:2), <b>and the rest</b> are fit <b>for</b> use in <b>meal offerings.</b>

### Part 12
How is <b>the second</b> olive harvest processed? <b>One picks</b> the crop of olives that is accessible while one is standing <b>on the rooftop.</b> This was the second lot of olives to ripen. <b>And one crushes</b> it in a mortar <b>and places</b> those olives <b>into</b> a wicker <b>basket,</b> allowing the oil to drip through the holes into a vessel underneath. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> One positions the olives on the walls, <b>surrounding the basket. This</b> is the <b>first</b> grade of oil from the second harvest.

### Part 13
<b>One</b> then <b>presses down</b> upon those olives <b>with</b> a wooden <b>beam,</b> thereby producing more oil. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> One applies pressure only <b>by</b> placing <b>stones</b> upon them. <b>This</b> is the <b>second</b> grade of oil.

### Part 14
<b>One then ground</b> the olives with a millstone <b>and pressed down</b> upon them with a beam, thereby extracting any remaining oil; <b>this</b> is the <b>third</b> grade of oil.

### Part 15
<b>The first</b> grade is fit <b>for</b> kindling <b>the Candelabrum, and the rest</b> are fit <b>for</b> use in <b>meal offerings.</b>

### Part 16
How is the <b>third</b> olive harvest processed? This harvest consists of all the olives that still remain on trees. <b>One packs it into a vat [<i>oteno</i>] in</b> the building that houses <b>the olive press [<i>beit habbad</i>]</b> where it remains <b>until it softens, and</b> then <b>one raises</b> it <b>up</b> to the roof <b>and dries it on the rooftop</b> to remove the foul-smelling liquid secreted from the olives while in the vat. Then, <b>one crushes</b> the olives in a mortar <b>and places</b> them <b>into</b> a wicker <b>basket,</b> allowing the oil to drip through the holes into a vessel underneath. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> One positions them on the walls, <b>surrounding the basket. This</b> is <b>the first</b> grade of oil.

### Part 17
<b>One</b> then <b>presses down</b> on those olives <b>with</b> a wooden <b>beam,</b> thereby producing more oil. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> One applies pressure only <b>by</b> placing <b>stones</b> upon them. <b>This</b> is the <b>second</b> grade of oil.

### Part 18
<b>One would then grind</b> the olives with a millstone <b>and press down</b> upon them with a beam, thereby extracting any remaining oil; <b>this</b> is the <b>third</b> grade of oil.

### Part 19
<b>The first</b> grade is fit <b>for</b> kindling <b>the Candelabrum, and the rest</b> are fit <b>for</b> use in <b>meal offerings.</b>

### Part 20
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: What is the correct text of the mishna? Do <b>we learn</b> that <b>one picks</b> the olives at the top <b>[<i>megargero</i>],</b> i.e., one selects those that are ripe, <b>or</b> do <b>we learn</b> that <b>one allows</b> all the olives <b>to ripen [<i>megalgelo</i>],</b> and then picks them all?

### Part 21
The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the resolution to this dilemma from that <b>which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. The verse states that the olive oil used for the kindling of the Candelabrum is to be: “Refined <b>oil of an olive”</b> (Exodus 27:20), which is interpreted to mean that the olives should be so ripe that the oil drips <b>from</b> them while they are still hanging on <b>their olive tree,</b> without them needing to be pressed. <b>From here</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that for the <b>first olive</b> harvest, <b>one allows</b> all the olives <b>to ripen [<i>megalgelo</i>],</b> picks the entire crop <b>and brings it into the olive press, and</b> he <b>grinds it with a millstone and places it in</b> wicker <b>baskets, and this oil that would flow from it would be</b> the <b>first</b> grade of oil.

### Part 22
The <i>baraita</i> continues: Then <b>one presses down</b> upon the olives <b>with</b> a wooden <b>beam.</b> As for the <b>oil that flows from it, this would be</b> the <b>second</b> grade of oil. And <b>then one would remove</b> the crushed olives from the baskets <b>and grind</b> them, <b>and press down</b> upon them with a beam or stones, thereby extracting any remaining oil; <b>this would be</b> the <b>third</b> grade of oil. <b>The first</b> grade is fit <b>for</b> kindling <b>the Candelabrum, and the rest</b> are fit <b>for</b> use in <b>meal offerings. And</b> the same process was <b>similarly</b> used for the <b>second olive</b> harvest.

### Part 23
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> for the <b>third olive</b> harvest, the entire crop <b>is packed into a vat in</b> the building that houses <b>the olive press,</b> where it remains <b>until it softens, and</b> then <b>one raises</b> it <b>up to the roof and makes it</b> into <b>a sort of heap,</b> wide at the bottom and narrow at the top, and leaves it there <b>until the fluid</b> it produced while in the vat <b>flows away. And</b> then <b>one brings it to the olive press and grinds it with a millstone and places it into</b> wicker <b>baskets.</b> As for the <b>oil that would</b> then <b>flow from it, this would be</b> the <b>first</b> grade of oil.

### Part 24
Then <b>one presses down</b> upon it <b>with</b> a wooden <b>beam.</b> As for the <b>oil that would</b> then <b>flow from it, this would be</b> the <b>second</b> grade of oil. <b>And then one would remove</b> the crushed olives from the baskets <b>and grind</b> them, <b>and press down</b> upon them with a beam or stones, thereby extracting any remaining oil; <b>this would be</b> the <b>third</b> grade of oil. <b>The first</b> grade is fit <b>for</b> kindling <b>the Candelabrum, and the rest</b> are fit <b>for</b> use in <b>meal offerings.</b>

### Part 25
The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> disagrees with the Rabbis and <b>says: One does not grind</b> the crop of olives <b>with a millstone; rather, one crushes it in a mortar. And one does not press down</b> upon the olives <b>with</b> a wooden <b>beam; rather,</b> one presses on them <b>with stones. And one does not place</b> the olives <b>into</b> the bottom of <b>the</b> wicker <b>baskets; rather,</b> one positions them on the inner walls of the basket, all <b>around the basket.</b> In this <i>baraita</i>, the term: One allows all the olives to ripen [<i>megalgelo</i>], is used.

### Part 26
Having resolved the dilemma based on the <i>baraita</i>, the Gemara now clarifies the ruling of the mishna in light of it. The Gemara asks: <b>This</b> mishna <b>itself</b> is <b>difficult,</b> as the first <i>tanna</i> teaches that the olives should be crushed. From the <i>baraita</i> it is evident that <b>whose</b> opinion is it that the olives are <b>crushed? It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b> Yet, when the first <i>tanna</i> states that the olives are placed <b>inside</b> the bottom <b>of the basket,</b> and not on its walls, <b>we arrive at</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> who disagree with Rabbi Yehuda in the <i>baraita</i>.

### Part 27
The Gemara explains: <b>This <i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda <b>with regard to one</b> issue, i.e., the need to crush the olives, <b>but disagrees with him with regard to another</b> issue, i.e., he holds that the olives should be placed inside the basket, not on its walls.

### Part 28
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Having enumerated the nine grades of oils in the previous mishna, this mishna proceeds to rank them by their quality: As for <b>the first</b> grade of oil <b>that is</b> produced <b>from the first</b> harvest, <b>there is none superior to it. The second</b> grade of oil <b>that is</b> produced <b>from the first</b> harvest <b>and the first</b> grade of oil <b>that is</b> produced <b>from the second</b> harvest are of <b>equal</b> quality; there is no reason to choose one over the other. <b>The third</b> grade of oil <b>that is</b> produced <b>from the first</b> harvest <b>and the second</b> grade of oil <b>that is</b> produced <b>from the second</b> harvest <b>and the first</b> grade of oil <b>that is</b> produced <b>from the third</b> harvest are of <b>equal</b> quality. <b>The third</b> grade of oil <b>that is</b> produced <b>from the second</b> harvest <b>and the second</b> grade of oil <b>that is</b> produced <b>from the third</b> harvest are of <b>equal</b> quality. As for <b>the third</b> grade of oil <b>that is</b> produced <b>from the third</b> harvest, <b>there is none inferior to it.</b>

### Part 29
<b>Also,</b> with regard to <b>all the meal offerings, it was logical that they should require</b> the highest quality of <b>refined olive oil,</b> just like the Candelabrum. Because <b>if</b> the <b>Candelabrum, whose</b> oil <b>is not to be consumed</b> on the altar, <b>requires refined olive oil,</b> then <b>meal offerings, which</b> are <b>to be consumed</b> on the altar, <b>is it not logical that they should require refined olive oil?</b> To dispel this notion, <b>the verse states: “Refined pounded</b> olive oil <b>for illumination”</b> (Leviticus 24:2), which indicates that the high-quality, refined, pounded oil is required for the Candelabrum, <b>but there is no</b> need for <b>refined pounded</b> olive oil <b>for meal offerings.</b>
