### Part 1
<b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that the mishna is referring to a case <b>where he does not have</b> a sufficient number of animals for both offerings. <b>And if</b> it is referring to the offerings <b>of that day, why</b> does the mishna say that failure to sacrifice one does not prevent sacrifice of the other? Since the daily offering is more <b>frequent</b> and it is sanctified, <b>and</b> the additional offerings are <b>sanctified</b> but are less frequent than the daily offering, the <b>frequent</b> offering <b>are given preference.</b> Consequently, failure to sacrifice the daily offering should prevent the sacrifice of the additional offerings.

### Part 2
<b>Rather, is it not</b> referring to a case where the Temple treasury does not have enough animals for both the additional offerings of today and the daily offering <b>of tomorrow, and</b> yet the mishna <b>teaches</b> that failure to sacrifice one does <b>not prevent</b> one from sacrificing <b>the other? Evidently, they are equal</b> and he may sacrifice whichever offering he chooses. This would resolve Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin’s dilemma.

### Part 3
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Ḥisda: That is not a valid resolution of the dilemma, as one can claim that <b>actually,</b> the mishna is referring to a case <b>where they have</b> enough animals for all the offerings, <b>and</b> the mishna is referring to the issue of sacrificing one <b>before</b> the other. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>that which</b> poses <b>a difficulty for you</b> based upon the <i>baraita</i> that states that <b>no</b> sacrifice <b>should precede</b> the sacrifice of the daily offering of the morning, that <i>baraita</i> <b>is merely</b> stating <b>the mitzva</b> <i>ab initio</i>.

### Part 4
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin’s dilemma based upon a mishna (<i>Arakhin</i> 13a): One maintains <b>no fewer than six lambs that</b> have been <b>inspected</b> and found to be unblemished <b>in the Chamber of the Lambs, sufficient for Shabbat and for the two festival days of Rosh HaShana</b> that in some years occur adjacent to it.

### Part 5
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case? <b>If we say that</b> it is referring to a case where the Temple treasury <b>has</b> enough animals for all of the offerings that should be brought, six lambs are not enough, as <b>there are many</b> lambs sacrificed for <b>daily offerings and additional offerings</b> on those three days. In total, twenty-two lambs are required: Two each day for the daily offerings, two for the additional offering of Shabbat, seven for the additional offering of Rosh HaShana, and seven for the additional offering of the New Moon.

### Part 6
<b>Rather, is it not that</b> the mishna is referring to a case where the Temple treasury <b>does not have</b> enough animals for all of the offerings, and it is teaching that the animals that he does have are utilized for the daily offerings of all three days rather than for the additional offering of Shabbat on the first of the three days? Consequently, one may <b>conclude from it</b> that the <b>daily offerings</b> of tomorrow <b>are given preference</b> over the additional offerings of today.

### Part 7
The Gemara replies: <b>No,</b> this is not a valid proof, as one can claim that <b>actually,</b> the mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> the Temple treasury <b>has</b> enough animals for all of the offerings of the three days, <b>and this is what</b> the mishna <b>is saying</b> when it mentions six lambs: One maintains for use as daily offerings <b>no fewer than six lambs that</b> have been <b>inspected</b> and found to be unblemished <b>in the Chamber of the Lambs four days prior to</b> their <b>slaughter.</b> Lambs sacrificed as other offerings do not have to be inspected four days prior to being slaughtered. <b>And</b> in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is this mishna? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>ben Bag Bag.</b>

### Part 8
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>ben Bag Bag says: From where</b> is it derived that <b>the daily offering requires inspection four days prior to</b> its <b>slaughter? The verse states</b> with regard to the daily offering: <b>“You shall observe [<i>tishmeru</i>] to sacrifice to Me in its due season”</b> (Numbers 28:2), <b>and elsewhere,</b> with regard to the Paschal offering, the verse <b>states:</b> “On the tenth day of this month they shall take for them every man a lamb…<b>and you shall keep it [<i>mishmeret</i>] until the fourteenth day</b> of this month” (Exodus 12:3–6).

### Part 9
Consequently, it is derived by means of a verbal analogy that <b>just as</b> in the verse <b>there,</b> the Paschal offering <b>requires inspection four days prior to</b> its <b>slaughter,</b> from the tenth of the month to the fourteenth, <b>so too here,</b> the daily offering <b>requires inspection four days prior to</b> its <b>slaughter.</b> This is not a requirement that pertains to all offerings; it is stated specifically with regard to the Paschal offering and extended by means of a verbal analogy to the daily offering.

### Part 10
§ The Gemara cites a discussion pertaining to the mishna cited earlier. <b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi:</b> With regard to <b>these six</b> inspected lambs that must always be kept in the Chamber of Lambs, there ought to <b>be seven, as there is</b> a need for another lamb for the daily offering <b>of the morning of the third</b> day <b>of the week,</b> since it cannot be inspected on Shabbat or the subsequent festival days of Rosh HaShana, and therefore should be inspected and kept beforehand.

### Part 11
Rav Ashi responded to Ravina: <b>According to your reasoning</b> the correct number is not seven, but rather <b>it is eight; as there is</b> also the daily offering <b>of the afternoon of Shabbat eve</b> that should also be counted.

### Part 12
Ravina replied: <b>That</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> because the mishna <b>is saying that after he sacrificed</b> the daily offering of the afternoon there must be six inspected lambs.
