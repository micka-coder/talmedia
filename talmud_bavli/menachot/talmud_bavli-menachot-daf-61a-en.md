### Part 1
The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>I include</b> from this verse the <b>other meal offerings, as they come due to themselves,</b> i.e., they do not accompany other offerings, <b>and I exclude</b> the <b>meal offering</b> brought with <b>libations, as it does not come due to itself</b> but rather together with an animal offering. The <i>baraita</i> challenges: <b>But the meal offering of priests and the meal offering of the anointed priest</b> also <b>come due to themselves,</b> and according to this logic one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they</b> too would <b>require bringing near.</b>

### Part 2
Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And he shall bring it near</b> to the altar” (Leviticus 2:8), to exclude the meal offering of priests and the meal offering of the anointed priest from the requirement of bringing near. The <i>baraita</i> raises a difficulty: <b>But that</b> verse <b>is required for its own sake,</b> i.e., to teach the basic <i>halakha</i> <b>that</b> a meal offering <b>requires bringing near</b> to the altar. The <i>baraita</i> answers: This <i>halakha</i> is derived <b>from</b> the fact that the verse could have stated just: <b>“And he shall bring,”</b> and instead it states: <b>“And he shall bring it.”</b>

### Part 3
The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>And what did you see</b> that led you <b>to include</b> the <b>other meal offerings</b> in the requirement of bringing near <b>and to exclude the meal offering of priests and the meal offering of the anointed priest?</b> The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>I include</b> the <b>other meal offerings, as there is</b> a part <b>of them</b> burned <b>in</b> the <b>fire</b> of the altar, <b>and they come due to themselves, and there is</b> a part <b>of them</b> given <b>to the priests</b> to eat. <b>And I exclude the two loaves and the shewbread, as there is no</b> part <b>of them</b> burned <b>in</b> the <b>fire. And</b> I exclude <b>the meal offering</b> brought with <b>libations, as it does not come due to itself, and</b> I also exclude <b>the meal offering of priests and the meal offering of the anointed priest, as there is no</b> part <b>of them</b> given <b>to the priests.</b>

### Part 4
The <i>baraita</i> continues: The verse states: “And the priest shall take off from the meal offering its memorial-part, and shall make it smoke upon the altar, an offering made by fire, of a pleasing aroma to the Lord” (Leviticus 2:9). With regard to the phrase: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall take off,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought the priest may perform this action even <b>with a vessel.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And this is the law of the meal offering: The sons of Aaron shall offer it before the Lord, in front of the altar. <b>And he shall take off from it his handful”</b> (Leviticus 6:7–8). <b>Just as the taking off that is stated below</b> is performed specifically <b>with the</b> priest’s <b>handful</b> and not with a vessel, <b>so too, the taking off that is stated here</b> must be performed <b>with the</b> priest’s <b>handful,</b> not with a vessel.

### Part 5
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>These</b> are the items that <b>require waving and do not require bringing near</b> to the altar: <b>The <i>log</i> of oil</b> that accompanies the guilt offering <b>of</b> a recovered <b>leper and his guilt offering</b> itself, as it is written: “And the priest shall take one of the lambs and sacrifice it for a guilt offering, and the <i>log</i> of oil, and wave them for a wave offering before the Lord” (Leviticus 14:12); <b>and the first fruits, in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov; and the sacrificial portions of the peace offerings of an individual and their breast and thigh,</b> as it is written: “The thigh of heaving and the breast of waving shall they bring with the offerings of the portions consumed by fire, to wave it for a wave offering before the Lord” (Leviticus 10:15).

### Part 6
This requirement applies to peace offerings belonging <b>both</b> to <b>men and</b> to <b>women, by</b> male <b>Jews and not by others.</b> The Gemara will explain this seemingly contradictory statement on 61b. In addition, <b>the two loaves and</b> the accompanying peace offering of <b>two lambs</b> brought on <b><i>Shavuot</i></b> also do not require bringing near but do require waving, as it is written: “And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the first fruits for a wave offering before the Lord, with the two lambs” (Leviticus 23:20).

### Part 7
<b>How does one perform</b> this waving? <b>He places the two loaves on top</b> of the <b>two lambs and places his two hands below</b> the loaves and the lambs, <b>extends</b> the offerings to each of the four directions <b>and brings</b> them <b>back,</b> then <b>raises and lowers</b> them, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the waving of the ram of the inauguration of the priests: <b>“Which is waved, and which is heaved up”</b> (Exodus 29:27); i.e., waved back and forth, and heaved up and down. <b>Waving was</b> able to be performed <b>to the east</b> of the altar, <b>but</b> the <b>bringing near</b> of meal offerings had to be done <b>to the west,</b> i.e., the southwest corner of the altar. Also, with regard to all meal offerings, <b>the wavings precede the</b> actions of <b>bringing near.</b>

### Part 8
<b>The <i>omer</i> meal offering and the meal offering of jealousy</b> brought by a <i>sota</i> <b>require</b> both <b>bringing near and waving.</b> The meal offering of the <i>omer</i> requires waving, as it is written: “And he shall wave the <i>omer</i> before the Lord” (Leviticus 23:11), and likewise with regard to the meal offering brought by a <i>sota</i> it is written: “And the priest shall take the meal offering of jealousy out of the woman’s hand and shall wave the meal offering before the Lord” (Numbers 5:25). The requirement of bringing near is derived as explained earlier. <b>The shewbread and the meal offering</b> brought with <b>libations require neither bringing near nor waving.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> There are <b>three types</b> of offerings that <b>require</b> performance of <b>three mitzvot. Two</b> mitzvot are performed <b>on each and every one</b> of them, <b>but the third</b> mitzva <b>is not</b> performed <b>in their</b> sacrifice, meaning that each of these offerings requires two out of the same three mitzvot, but not necessarily the same two as the others. <b>And these are the</b> three offerings: <b>Peace offerings</b> brought as gift offerings by an <b>individual, communal peace offerings,</b> i.e., the two lambs brought with the two loaves on <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>and the guilt offering of a leper</b> (see Leviticus 14:12–14).

### Part 10
<b>Peace offerings</b> brought by <b>individuals require placing hands</b> on the head of the animals while the animals are still <b>alive, and waving</b> when they are <b>slaughtered, but there is no</b> obligation of <b>waving them</b> while they are <b>alive. Communal peace offerings require waving</b> both while the animals are still <b>alive and</b> after they are <b>slaughtered, but there is no</b> obligation of <b>placing hands</b> on them. <b>And the guilt offering of a leper requires placing hands and waving</b> while the animal is still <b>alive, but there is no</b> obligation of <b>waving</b> it after it is <b>slaughtered.</b>

### Part 11
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that both the <i>log</i> of oil that accompanies the guilt offering of a recovered leper and the guilt offering itself require waving. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And the priest shall take one of the lambs <b>and sacrifice it for a guilt offering, and the <i>log</i> of oil, and wave them for a wave offering</b> before the Lord” (Leviticus 14:12). The plural form “them” <b>teaches that</b> the <i>log</i> of oil and the offering <b>require waving,</b> and that this should be performed with both of them <b>together.</b>

### Part 12
<b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that if</b> the priest <b>waved this one by itself and that one by itself</b> that he has <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation? <b>The</b> same <b>verse states,</b> in the singular form: <b>“And sacrifice it for a guilt offering…and wave.”</b> The Gemara inquires: Since parts of this verse are in the singular and parts are in the plural, one <b>might</b> have thought that he should <b>wave</b> both together, <b>and then wave</b> each one separately. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “A wave offering,”</b> which indicates that he should perform one waving, <b>but not</b> multiple <b>wavings.</b>

### Part 13
With regard to the phrase: “A wave offering <b>before the Lord,”</b> the <i>baraita</i> states that this teaches that waving can be performed <b>to the east</b> of the altar, as taught in the mishna. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But doesn’t</b> the <i>tanna</i> of a <i>baraita</i> cited earlier in the tractate (19b) <b>say,</b> concerning a verse discussing the bringing near of a meal offering, which states: <b>“Before the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 6:7), that one <b>might</b> have thought one brings it <b>to the west</b> of the altar, as this is the side facing the Sanctuary? That <i>tanna</i> proceeds to explain that the phrase: “In front of the altar” (Leviticus 6:7), is a reference to the south, where one ascends the altar, and therefore the meal offering must be brought to the southwest corner. This indicates, though, that the expression “before the Lord” is a reference to the west.

### Part 14
The Gemara answers: The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>This statement,</b> that the expression “before the Lord” is a reference to the west and not to the east, applies only with regard to the <b>meal offering, which is called “a sin offering,”</b> as the verse states: “It is most sacred, like the sin offering” (Leviticus 6:10), <b>and</b> the <b>sin offering requires</b> its remaining blood to be poured out on the <b>base</b> of the altar. Therefore, the meal offering must also be brought to a part of the altar where there is a base, <b>and</b> as the <b>southeast corner</b> of the altar <b>did not have a base,</b> the meal offering must be brought to the southwest corner. In this manner one fulfills both the requirement of “in front of the altar,” i.e., to the south, and the requirement of “before the Lord.” <b>But here,</b> with regard to the <i>log</i> of oil and guilt offering of a leper, <b>we call</b> any side of the altar <b>“before the Lord.”</b>

### Part 15
§ The mishna teaches: <b>The first fruits</b> also require waving, <b>in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov,</b> alluded to here? The Gemara answers that it is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the first fruits: <b>“And the priest shall take</b> the basket from your hand, and place it before the altar of the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 26:4). This <b>taught</b> a <i>halakha</i> <b>concerning the first fruits, that they require waving;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov,</b> as the verse is not explicitly referring to waving? The Gemara explains: The matter <b>is derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy from <b>“hand,”</b> written with regard to first fruits, and <b>from “hand,”</b> written with regard to <b>a peace offering. It is written here,</b> with regard to first fruits: <b>“And the priest shall take the basket from your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:4), <b>and it is written there:</b> offering “He who offers his peace offering to God…<b>his hands shall bring it,</b> the fire of God…to raise it as a waving before God” (Leviticus 7:29–30).
