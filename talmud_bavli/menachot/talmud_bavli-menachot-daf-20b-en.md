### Part 1
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>On the contrary, blood should be included</b> in the requirement to have salt applied, <b>since</b> it <b>renders</b> the offering <b>permitted</b> to be sacrificed and eaten, <b>as</b> is so with regard to the handful, which renders the remainder of the meal offering permitted to be eaten. In addition, blood <b>becomes invalid at sunset</b> and can no longer be sprinkled on the altar, <b>as</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the handful of a meal offering, whereas the limbs of the burnt offering may be sacrificed at any point during the night. The Gemara responds: <b>These</b> characteristics shared by the meal offering and the limbs of the burnt offering are <b>more</b> than those shared by the blood and the meal offering.

### Part 2
§ The Gemara continues discussing the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master said</b> above: Had the verse stated only: And every offering you shall season with salt, <b>I</b> would <b>derive</b> that this applies to <b>even</b> the <b>wood and</b> the <b>blood, which are</b> also <b>termed: An offering.</b> Therefore, the verse states “and every meal offering of yours” (Leviticus 2:13), to teach that just as the meal offering is unique in that other items come as a requirement for it, so too, anything that is unique in that other items come as a requirement for it requires the application of salt. Therefore, the wood and the blood do not require salting, as in their case no other item is needed. The Gemara asks: <b>Whom did you hear who says</b> that the <b>wood is termed an offering?</b> It is <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. But <b>according to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, doesn’t the wood in fact <b>require salting?</b>

### Part 3
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And when one brings <b>a meal offering [<i>korban minḥa</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 2:1). The superfluous word <i>korban</i> <b>teaches that one can voluntarily give wood</b> as an offering for the altar. <b>And how much</b> wood must one bring if he does not specify an amount? <b>Two logs. And</b> the support for the fact that wood can be brought as a voluntary offering is from a verse, <b>as</b> the verse <b>states: “And we cast lots for the wood offering”</b> (Nehemiah 10:35). <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> This voluntary donation of <b>wood is</b> an offering like <b>a meal offering, and</b> therefore it <b>requires salt and requires bringing</b> to the corner of the altar, like a meal offering.

### Part 4
<b>And Rava says: According to the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>wood</b> donated in this manner <b>requires</b> the <b>removal of a handful,</b> just as in the case of a meal offering, a portion of the wood must be removed and sacrificed separately. <b>And Rav Pappa says</b> that <b>according to the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, since it is an offering for the altar, the <b>wood</b> that is brought as an offering <b>needs</b> to be placed on other <b>wood</b> to burn, like any other offering that is burned on wood on the altar. Apparently, this means that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, who holds that the wood is termed an offering, also holds that it requires the application of salt, in contrast to the ruling in the <i>baraita</i>.

### Part 5
The Gemara responds: <b>Remove wood from</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>here,</b> as it is not excluded by the term “and every meal offering of yours.” The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> then, the phrase in <b>the verse</b> “and every meal offering of yours” is <b>to exclude what? If</b> it serves <b>to exclude blood,</b> this is <b>derived from</b> the continuation of the verse, which states: <b>“From your meal offering,”</b> as explained in the continuation of the <i>baraita</i>.
