### Part 1
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>ritual fringes</b> on a linen <b>cloak, Beit Shammai deem</b> the cloak <b>exempt</b> from ritual fringes due to the fact that the sky-blue strings must be made from wool, and there is a Torah prohibition against wearing a mixture of wool and linen. <b>And Beit Hillel deem</b> a linen cloak <b>obligated</b> in the mitzva of ritual fringes. <b>And</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with the statement of Beit Hillel.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Rabbi Tzadok says: But is it not</b> the case that <b>anyone who affixes sky-blue</b> strings to a linen cloak <b>in Jerusalem is</b> considered <b>nothing other than one of those who causes</b> others <b>to be astonished</b> at their behavior, as it appears that he is violating the prohibition against wearing a garment containing wool and linen?

### Part 3
The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: If so,</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with Beit Hillel and a linen cloak is required to have ritual fringes, <b>why did</b> the Sages <b>prohibit</b> attaching ritual fringes to linen garments in Jerusalem? It is <b>because</b> people <b>are not well versed</b> in the <i>halakha</i> and might ultimately wear garments of wool and linen even when it is not necessary for the mitzva of ritual fringes.

### Part 4
<b>Rava bar Rav Ḥana said to Rava:</b> If that is the concern, then <b>let ten</b> people <b>take</b> linen cloaks with ritual fringes <b>and go out to the marketplace and</b> thereby <b>publicize the matter,</b> i.e., that it is permitted to affix wool strings to a linen garment due to the mitzva. Rava answered: <b>All the more so</b> people <b>would be astonished at us</b> for acting in such an unconventional manner.

### Part 5
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let</b> the Rabbis <b>teach during</b> their public <b>lecture</b> that affixing wool strings to a linen garment is permitted for the mitzva of ritual fringes. The Gemara answers: Wearing strings on a linen garment is prohibited because of a rabbinic <b>decree due to</b> the concern that people might use strings that were dyed blue with <b>indigo [<i>kala ilan</i>],</b> instead of with <i>tekhelet</i>, the sky-blue dye produced from the <i>ḥilazon</i> (see 44b), in which case they would not fulfill the mitzva of ritual fringes and would violate the prohibition against wearing garments containing wool and linen.

### Part 6
The Gemara suggests: Even if one’s blue strings are not dyed with <i>tekhelet</i> as required for the mitzva, <b>let</b> them <b>be</b> considered <b>merely</b> as <b>white</b> strings. In the absence of <i>tekhelet</i> one fulfills the mitzva with white strings, and therefore it should be permitted to affix white woolen strings to a linen garment. The Gemara explains: <b>Since it is possible</b> to affix white strings that are <b>the same type</b> of material as the garment, i.e., linen, and thereby fulfill the mitzva without overriding the prohibition against wearing a garment made from wool and linen, one may <b>not</b> affix white wool strings to a linen garment.

### Part 7
The Gemara notes: This is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Reish Lakish. As Reish Lakish says: Any place where you find a positive mitzva and a prohibition</b> that clash with one another, <b>if you are able to fulfill both of them,</b> that is <b>preferable; and if</b> that is <b>not</b> possible, <b>the positive mitzva shall come and override the prohibition.</b> In this case, the clash is between the mitzva of ritual fringes and the prohibition against wearing a garment that contains wool and linen. One can fulfill both of them by using white strings that are linen instead of wool if the garment is made from linen.

### Part 8
The Gemara suggests: <b>And let them test</b> the strings to ascertain whether they are dyed with indigo or with <i>tekhelet</i>, as explained by the Gemara (42b). The Gemara responds: <b>Rather,</b> the prohibition against affixing ritual fringes to a linen garment is a rabbinic <b>decree due to</b> the concern that perhaps the sky-blue strings were colored with <i>tekhelet</i> dye that had been used for <b>testing</b> the color of the dye in the vat and therefore became unfit (see 42b). In such a case, there would be no fulfillment of the mitzva of sky-blue ritual fringes to override the prohibition against wearing a garment of wool and linen.

### Part 9
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let</b> the Sages <b>write letters</b> informing dye producers that <i>tekhelet</i> that was used for testing the color of the dye in the vat is unfit for ritual fringes. The Gemara explains: <b>Shall we go and rely on letters,</b> assuming that dye producers will follow the instructions they contain? <b>Rava</b> responded to this and <b>said: Now,</b>
