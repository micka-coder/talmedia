### Part 1
<b>I ask, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Does <b>the man</b> who vowed to bring eleven <i>log</i> <b>intend</b> to bring an amount of wine corresponding to that which is brought in association with an offering <b>of two bulls,</b> i.e., twelve <i>log</i>, <b>and until he accumulates that</b> amount, the libation <b>is not brought? Or perhaps he intends</b> to bring an amount equal to that associated <b>with two rams and one lamb,</b> i.e., four for each ram and three for the lamb, totaling eleven. <b>Do we say</b> that he intended to bring <b>two</b> libations associated <b>with one type,</b> i.e., a ram, <b>and one</b> libation associated <b>with another type,</b> i.e., a lamb, <b>or not? What</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 2
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may pledge</b> to bring independent libations of <b>wine, but one may not pledge oil</b> alone; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Tarfon says: One may pledge oil</b> as well.

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Tarfon said: Just as we found that wine comes</b> as <b>an obligation and comes</b> as <b>a gift offering</b> independent of any offering, <b>so too,</b> we find <b>that oil comes</b> as <b>an obligation and comes</b> as <b>a gift</b> offering. <b>Rabbi Akiva said to him: No, if you said</b> that this is true <b>with regard to wine, as</b> it is <b>sacrificed with its obligatory</b> offering <b>by itself, shall you</b> also <b>say</b> that this is also the case <b>with regard to oil, which is never sacrificed with its obligatory</b> offering <b>by itself but only</b> mixed with the flour?

### Part 4
The mishna concludes with a ruling concerning a voluntary meal offering: <b>Two</b> people <b>do not pledge</b> a meal offering of <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah as partners, <b>but they may pledge a burnt offering and a peace offering. And</b> they may pledge to bring even <b>an individual bird,</b> not only a pair.

### Part 5
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the dispute between Rabbi Tarfon and Rabbi Akiva about whether one can pledge oil, <b>Rava said: From the statements of both of them, we learn</b> that <b>a person may pledge a meal offering</b> like those brought <b>with the libations</b> that accompany animal offerings every day.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious?</b> The Gemara explains: It needed to be said, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>the Merciful One revealed</b> the nature of <b>a voluntary meal offering</b> (see Leviticus, chapter 2). Perhaps only <b>those five meal offerings</b> detailed there are <b>indeed</b> brought as voluntary offerings, but any <b>additional</b> types, such as a meal offering brought with libations, are <b>not.</b> Rava therefore <b>teaches us</b> that <b>these matters</b> in the Torah apply only <b>where</b> his pledge of a meal offering was <b>unspecified, but where he specified</b> that the oil and flour about which he vows should be brought in the manner of a meal offering with libations, then <b>he has specified,</b> and the vow takes effect.

### Part 7
§ The mishna stated that <b>two</b> people <b>do not pledge</b> a tenth of an ephah together. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason? If we say</b> that it is <b>because it is written:</b> “And when an individual <b>brings</b> a meal offering” (Leviticus 2:1), in the singular, that is not a proof, as with regard to <b>a burnt offering as well, it is written</b> in the singular: “When any man of you <b>brings</b> an offering” (Leviticus 1:2). Nevertheless, two people may bring a burnt offering together, as stated in the mishna.

### Part 8
<b>Rather, what is the reason</b> that <b>a burnt offering</b> is brought by two people? The reason is <b>that it is written</b> in second person plural: “These you shall offer…beside <b>your burnt offerings [<i>le’oloteikhem</i>],</b> or your meal offerings, or your drink offerings, or your peace offerings” (Numbers 29:39). The Gemara points out: With regard to <b>a meal offering,</b> it is <b>also written</b> in the plural: <b>“Your meal offerings [<i>leminḥoteikhem</i>].” Rather,</b> the reason that one may not bring a meal offering as a partnership is <b>because it is written:</b> “And when <b>an individual</b> brings a meal offering” (Leviticus 2:1), indicating that only one individual may offer it, but not two together.

### Part 9
<b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>states</b> an explanation of the following verse: “Anyone <b>that brings his offering, whether it be any of their vows, or any of their free-will offerings that they sacrifice to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 22:18). It is evident from the use of the plural in the second part of the verse that <b>any</b> offering can <b>be brought in a partnership, and the verse excludes only a meal offering</b> from this principle, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And when <b>an individual</b> brings a meal offering.”

### Part 10
The Gemara cites another comment about the fact that the Torah introduces the voluntary meal offering by emphasizing that it is brought by an individual. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: For what</b> reason <b>is the meal offering different</b> from other offerings in <b>that</b> the term <b>“an individual [<i>nefesh</i>]” is stated with regard to it? The Holy One, Blessed be He, said: Whose practice</b> is it <b>to bring a meal offering?</b> It is that of a <b>poor</b> individual; and <b>I will ascribe him</b> credit <b>as if he offered up his soul [<i>nafsho</i>] in front of Me.</b>

### Part 11
§ The Gemara cites another comment made by Rabbi Yitzḥak about meal offerings. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: What is</b> the reason that the <b>meal offering is differentiated</b> from other offerings in <b>that</b> the Torah <b>stated these five types of preparations with oil</b> with regard to it? The five types of voluntary meal offerings are: A meal offering of fine flour, a meal offering in a shallow pan, a meal offering in a deep pan, a meal offering of loaves baked in an oven, and a meal offering of wafers baked in an oven. All are brought with oil. This can be explained by <b>a parable of a flesh-and-blood king whose friend made a festive meal for him, but</b> the king <b>knows that</b> the friend <b>is poor.</b> The king <b>said to him: Make for me</b> foods <b>from five types of fried</b> dishes, <b>so that I may benefit from you.</b>

### Part 13
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> One who says: <b>It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah for a meal offering, <b>must bring</b> a meal offering of <b>one</b>-tenth. If he says: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>tenths</b> of an ephah, <b>he must bring two</b>-tenths, as that is the minimum plural amount. If he says: <b>I specified</b> several tenths of an ephah <b>but I do not know which</b> number <b>I specified, he must bring sixty-tenths,</b> as that is the maximum amount of a meal offering. The flour beyond the amount that he actually specified is rendered a voluntary meal offering.

### Part 14
If one says: <b>It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a meal offering, he may bring whichever</b> meal offering <b>that he wishes,</b> i.e., the fine-flour meal offering, the shallow-pan or deep-pan meal offering, or the meal offering baked in an oven in the form of loaves or wafers. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: He must bring the fine-flour meal offering, as it is the</b> most <b>notable of the meal offerings.</b>

### Part 15
If one says: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a meal offering, or:</b> It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a type of meal offering, he must bring one</b> meal offering. If he says: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>meal offerings, or:</b> It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>meal offerings of</b> a certain <b>type, he must bring two.</b> If he says: <b>I specified</b> a meal offering <b>but I do not know which</b> meal offering <b>I specified, he must bring all five</b> types of meal offerings.

### Part 16
If one says: <b>I specified a meal offering of tenths</b> of an ephah <b>but I do not know how many</b> tenths <b>I specified, he must bring</b> a meal offering of <b>sixty-tenths</b> of an ephah. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> His obligation is satisfied only when <b>he brings meal offerings of</b> all sizes, in increments of <b>tenths</b> of an ephah, ranging <b>from one</b>-tenth of an ephah <b>to sixty</b>-tenths, for a total of sixty meal offerings with a total volume of 1,830 tenths of an ephah, or 183 ephahs. He fulfills his vow with one of the meal offerings, and the rest are rendered voluntary meal offerings.

### Part 17
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that one who says: It is incumbent upon me to bring a tenth of an ephah for a meal offering, must bring a meal offering of a tenth. The Gemara asks: Isn’t this <b>obvious?</b> Why is it necessary to teach this in the mishna? The Gemara answers that it <b>was necessary</b> for the mishna to mention this case as a preamble to the following <i>halakha</i>, that if one says: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>tenths</b> of an ephah he must <b>bring two</b>-tenths. The Gemara asks: Isn’t <b>this also obvious?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary</b> to teach that the <b>minimum</b> amount that the word <b>tenths</b> is used in reference to is <b>two</b>-tenths.

### Part 18
§ The mishna teaches that if one says: <b>I specified</b> several tenths of an ephah <b>but I do not know what</b> number <b>I specified, he must bring sixty-tenths.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> this?

### Part 19
<b>Ḥizkiyya said:</b> This statement is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi mentioned at the end of the mishna. <b>As if</b> it was the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>didn’t he say</b> that such a person <b>must bring meal offerings of</b> all sizes, in increments of <b>tenths</b> of an ephah, ranging <b>from one</b>-tenth of an ephah <b>to sixty</b>-tenths?

### Part 20
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> disagreed and <b>said: You</b> may <b>even say</b> that this statement is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, because the case at the end of the mishna is a case where one specified that he would bring the tenths of an ephah in a single vessel. In such a case Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi holds that one must bring sixty different amounts in sixty different vessels. By contrast, the former case in the mishna is one <b>where</b> the person <b>says: I specified</b> several <b>tenths</b> of an ephah <b>but I did not establish</b> that <b>they</b> must be brought <b>in</b> one <b>vessel.</b> In such a case all agree <b>that he must bring sixty-tenths</b> of an ephah <b>in sixty vessels,</b> a tenth in each vessel.

### Part 21
§ The mishna teaches that if one says: <b>It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a meal offering,</b> the first <i>tanna</i> holds <b>he may bring whichever</b> meal offering <b>he wishes,</b> whereas Rabbi Yehuda maintains that he must bring the fine-flour meal offering, as it is the most notable of the meal offerings. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Rabbi Yehuda says that he must bring the fine-flour meal offering, <b>since</b> in the passage of the Torah that discusses the meal offering (Leviticus, chapter 2) <b>the verse opens with</b> the fine-flour meal offering <b>first,</b> mentioning it before the other meal offerings.

### Part 22
The Gemara challenges: <b>If that is so, one who says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a burnt offering,</b> without specifying which type of animal, <b>must bring a young bull</b> as his burnt offering, <b>since the verse opens with it</b>
