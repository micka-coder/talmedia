### Part 1
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: How can the mishna state that the second grade of the first harvest and the first grade of the second harvest are of <b>equal</b> quality? <b>But didn’t you say</b> that the <b>first</b> grade of each harvest is fit <b>for</b> kindling <b>the Candelabrum and the rest</b> are fit only <b>for</b> use in <b>meal offerings?</b> It would appear then that the first grade in any harvest is actually superior to the second grade of other harvests. To resolve this, <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: What</b> does the mishna mean when it states that <b>they are</b> of <b>equal</b> quality? It means that <b>they are equal with regard to meal offerings,</b> and there is no reason to choose one over the other.

### Part 2
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Also</b> with regard to <b>all the meal offerings, it was logical</b> that they should require refined olive oil. To dispel this notion, the verse states: “Refined pounded olive oil for illumination” (Leviticus 24:2). <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse cited in the mishna: The word <b>“refined”</b> means <b>nothing other than clean</b> oil, which flows by itself from the olives without applying any pressure. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that the word <b>“pounded”</b> means <b>nothing other than</b> olives <b>crushed</b> with a mortar, but not with a millstone.

### Part 3
One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>refined, pounded</b> oil <b>is unfit for meal offerings,</b> since the verse specifies that this oil is to be used for illumination. To dispel this notion, <b>the verse states</b> with regard to the meal offering brought with the daily offering: <b>“And a tenth of fine flour, thoroughly mixed with</b> a quarter of a <i>hin</i> of <b>pounded oil”</b> (Exodus 29:40). This indicates that pounded oil is fit to be used in meal offerings. <b>If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> that the refined pounded oil is <b>“for illumination”? Rather,</b> the Torah requires the use of refined pounded oil only for the Candelabrum, <b>due to the sparing [<i>haḥisakhon</i>]</b> of money, as the highest-quality oil is very expensive.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the reason for being <b>sparing? Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The intention is that <b>the Torah spared the money of the Jewish people</b> and did not require that the highest-quality oil be used for the meal offerings.

### Part 5
§ The Gemara discusses the Candelabrum and other aspects of the Temple. The verse states: <b>“Command the children of Israel, and they shall take for yourself refined pounded olive oil</b> for illumination, to kindle the lamps continually” (Leviticus 24:2). <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says:</b> God tells the Jewish people that the oil should be taken <b>“for yourself,”</b> to indicate that it is for their benefit <b>and not for My</b> benefit, as <b>I do not need its light.</b>

### Part 6
Similarly, with regard to the <b>Table</b> of the shewbread, located <b>in the north</b> of the Sanctuary, <b>and</b> the <b>Candelabrum,</b> located <b>in the south</b> of the Sanctuary, <b>Rabbi Zerika says</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> God said to the Jewish people: <b>I do not require</b> the Table <b>for eating, nor do I require</b> the Candelabrum <b>for its illumination.</b> In evidence of this, the Candelabrum was not positioned close to the Table, as is done by one who sets a table with food in order to eat there.

### Part 7
With regard the Temple built by King Solomon, the verse states: <b>“And he made for the House, windows narrow and broad”</b> (I Kings 6:4). The Sages <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Typically, windows are constructed to widen toward the inside in order that the light from the outside would be dispersed throughout the room. For the Temple, God said: Make the windows <b>narrow within and broad without,</b> as <b>I do not require its illumination.</b> On the contrary, the light of the Temple is to be radiated outward.

### Part 8
God instructed Aaron to kindle the Candelabrum: <b>“Outside the Curtain of the testimony in the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 24:3). The dividing curtain is referred to here as: The Curtain of the testimony, to indicate that the illumination of the Candelabrum <b>is testimony to all of humanity that the Divine Presence rests among the Jewish people.</b>

### Part 9
<b>And if you</b> question this and <b>say:</b> How is this testimony; perhaps the Candelabrum is lit for illumination? To this God would respond: Do <b>I need its light? But isn’t</b> it so that for <b>all forty years that</b> the <b>Jewish people walked in the wilderness</b> of Sinai until they entered Eretz Yisrael, <b>they walked exclusively by His light,</b> i.e., from the pillar of fire that guided them at night. If God provides light for others, he certainly does not need it Himself. <b>Rather,</b> evidently, the illumination of the Candelabrum <b>is testimony to all of humanity that the Divine Presence rests among the Jewish people.</b>

### Part 10
<b>What</b> provides <b>its testimony? Rava says:</b> The testimony <b>is</b> provided by <b>the westernmost lamp</b> of the Candelabrum, <b>in which they place</b> a quantity of <b>oil equivalent</b> to that placed in <b>the other</b> lamps, <b>and</b> nevertheless it continues to burn longer than any of the other lamps. It burns so long that every evening, <b>from it</b> the priest <b>would kindle</b> the Candelabrum, i.e., he lit that westernmost lamp first, <b>and</b> the following morning, <b>with it he would conclude</b> the preparation of the lamps for the following evening’s lighting, because it remained alight longer than any of the other lamps. This perpetual miracle was testimony to God’s continuous presence among His people.

### Part 11
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>From where would they bring the wine</b> for libations? <b>Keduḥim and Attulin</b> are the <b>primary</b> sources <b>for wine. Secondary to them</b> is <b>Beit Rima and Beit Lavan,</b> located <b>in the mountain, and</b> the <b>village of Signa,</b> located <b>in the valley. All the regions were valid</b> sources for wine; <b>but</b> it was <b>from here,</b> i.e., the aforementioned locations, that <b>they would bring</b> the wine.

### Part 12
<b>One may not bring</b> libations of wine that come <b>from a fertilized vineyard, or from an irrigated vineyard, or from</b> a vineyard in <b>which</b> grain <b>was sown between</b> the vines. <b>But if one did bring</b> a libation from such wine, it is <b>valid. One may not bring</b> libations from <b>sweet wine made from sun-dried grapes [<i>hilyasteyon</i>], but if one did bring</b> a libation from such wine, it is <b>valid. One may not bring</b> wine <b>aged</b> for one year; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>but the Rabbis deem it valid. One may not bring</b> libations from <b>sweet</b> wine, <b>nor</b> from wine produced from <b>smoked</b> grapes, <b>nor</b> libations <b>from boiled</b> wine, <b>and if one did bring</b> a libation from such wine, it is <b>not valid. And one may not bring</b> wine produced from <b>grapes suspended</b> on stakes or trees; <b>rather,</b> one brings it <b>from grapes at foot</b> height, i.e., that rest on the ground, which are superior-quality grapes, and from <b>vineyards that are cultivated,</b> i.e., where one hoes beneath the vines twice a year.

### Part 13
<b>And</b> when producing wine for libations, <b>one should not collect</b> the wine <b>into large barrels,</b> as it causes the wine to spoil; <b>rather,</b> it should be placed <b>in small casks. And one does not fill up</b> the cask <b>until its mouth;</b> rather, one leaves some empty space <b>so that its fragrance will</b> collect there and <b>diffuse</b> when the lid is opened.

### Part 14
<b>One should not bring</b> libations <b>from</b> wine that rests at the <b>mouth of</b> the cask <b>due to</b>
