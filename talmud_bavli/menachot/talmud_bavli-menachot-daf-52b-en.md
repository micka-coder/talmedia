### Part 1
<b>according to the Rabbis,</b> who hold that generally one handful of frankincense is divided between the morning and afternoon offerings, <b>is the</b> amount of <b>frankincense doubled or not? Do we say</b> that <b>since</b> in this case <b>its fine flour is doubled,</b> as a complete tenth of an ephah of fine flour is sacrificed in both the morning and evening, <b>its frankincense</b> is also <b>doubled? Or perhaps that which</b> the verse <b>reveals,</b> i.e., that a complete tenth of an ephah is sacrificed in the morning and afternoon, <b>it reveals,</b> and <b>that which</b> it <b>does not reveal,</b> it <b>does not reveal;</b> and therefore, since the verse does not indicate that the amount of frankincense is doubled, only one handful is brought.

### Part 2
<b>And</b> furthermore, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning the <b>oil</b> of the griddle-cake offering in a case where the High Priest died and was not yet replaced, <b>both</b> according <b>to Abba Yosei ben Dostai and</b> according <b>to the Rabbis?</b> Is the required amount three <i>log</i>, as it is when the High Priest brings the griddle-cake offering, or is the amount of oil doubled just as the amount of fine flour is doubled?

### Part 3
<b>Rava said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to the dilemma concerning the quantity of frankincense that is brought in this case, based upon a mishna (106b): <b>There are five</b> <i>halakhot</i> pertaining to <b>a handful.</b> The <i>halakha</i> of the frankincense sacrificed with the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest is not included in this number, because only half a handful of frankincense is sacrificed at one time. <b>And if it is so</b> that when there is no High Priest a complete handful is brought in the morning and in the afternoon, then <b>sometimes you find</b> that there are <b>seven</b> <i>halakhot</i> pertaining to a handful.

### Part 4
The Gemara rejects this proof: The <i>tanna</i> <b>does not teach</b> cases of <b>what if</b> the High Priest died, and is speaking only about a typical case. The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Pappa was sitting and teaching this <i>halakha</i>. Rav Yosef bar Shemaya said to Rav Pappa: But</b> the mishna does list the case of <b>one who</b> intentionally <b>offers up</b> the <b>handful</b> from a meal offering <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard, who is liable to receive <i>karet</i>. This <b>is</b> not a standard case but rather a case of <b>what if, and</b> nevertheless it <b>is taught</b> in the mishna. Accordingly, Rava’s proof is valid.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about</b> this matter? <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of a <b>High Priest who died and they did not</b> yet <b>appoint another in his stead, a complete</b> tenth of an ephah of fine flour is brought for the griddle-cake offering in the <b>morning and</b> another <b>complete</b> tenth of an ephah is brought <b>in the afternoon. And one separates two handfuls</b> of frankincense <b>for it,</b> and sacrifices one <b>handful</b> with the <b>morning</b> offering <b>and</b> one <b>handful</b> with the <b>afternoon</b> offering. <b>And</b> one <b>separates three <i>log</i></b> of oil <b>for it,</b> and brings <b>a <i>log</i> and a half</b> with the <b>morning</b> offering <b>and a <i>log</i> and a half</b> with the <b>afternoon</b> offering.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is this <i>baraita</i>? <b>If we say</b> that it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, what is different</b> about <b>its frankincense</b> such <b>that it is doubled</b> in the case where the High Priest died, <b>and what is different</b> about <b>its oil</b> such <b>that it is not doubled?</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Abba Yosei ben Dostai, who said:</b> The <b>griddle-cake</b> offering of the <b>High Priest generally requires two handfuls. And</b> therefore when the <i>baraita</i> requires two handfuls of frankincense in the case where the High Priest died and another has not yet been appointed, the <b>frankincense is not</b> being <b>doubled and the oil is</b> also <b>not doubled.</b> Therefore, three <i>log</i> of oil are required, as usual.

### Part 8
<b>And from</b> the fact <b>that</b> according <b>to Abba Yosei ben Dostai</b> the requisite <b>oil is not doubled,</b> one can conclude that <b>also</b> according <b>to the Rabbis its frankincense and its oil are not doubled.</b>

### Part 9
This discussion in the Gemara began with Rabbi Yoḥanan presenting the dispute between Abba Yosei ben Dostai and the Rabbis, and it concludes with his ruling concerning their dispute. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Abba Yosei ben Dostai.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> actually <b>say this? But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan state</b> a principle that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the ruling of <b>an unattributed mishna,</b> and <b>we learned</b> in the unattributed mishna cited earlier: <b>There are</b> only <b>five</b> <i>halakhot</i> pertaining to <b>a handful.</b> Since the mishna does not list the fact that a handful of frankincense is offered twice daily with the griddle-cake offering, how can Rabbi Yoḥanan accept that opinion?

### Part 10
The Gemara answers: <b>They are</b> different <b><i>amora’im</i>, and</b> they disagree <b>with regard to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b> One said that Rabbi Yoḥanan rules in accordance with Abba Yosei ben Dostai, and one said that according to Rabbi Yoḥanan the <i>halakha</i> is always in accordance with an unattributed mishna.
