that was <b>forty days old.</b> He would <b>soak</b> the sky-blue wool <b>in</b> this solution <b>from night until morning.</b> If <b>its color would fade [<i>ipparad ḥazutei</i>],</b> the sky-blue wool was determined to be <b>unfit,</b> as it was not dyed with <i>tekhelet</i> derived from a <i>ḥilazon</i>. If <b>its color would not fade,</b> the sky-blue wool was determined to be <b>fit.</b>

### Part 2
<b>And Rav Adda said before Rava in the name of Rav Avira: One brings hard [<i>arkesa</i>] leavened barley</b> dough <b>and bakes</b> the sky-blue wool <b>in it.</b> If the color of the sky-blue wool <b>changes for the better,</b> meaning that the process intensifies the color of the sky-blue wool, then it is <b>fit.</b> If the color of the sky-blue wool changes for the <b>worse,</b> i.e., it fades, then it is <b>unfit. And your mnemonic</b> is: <b>Change</b> reveals <b>falsehood</b> and <b>change</b> reveals <b>truth.</b> All of this indicates that it is possible to test whether sky-blue wool has been dyed with real <i>tekhelet</i>, contrary to the <i>baraita</i>.

### Part 3
The Gemara explains the <i>baraita</i>: <b>What</b> does it mean <b>when it says: There is no</b> reliable method of <b>testing</b> sky-blue wool? It means that there is no way to test whether it was dyed for the sake of the mitzva or <b>for</b> the purpose of <b>testing</b> the dye.

### Part 4
The Gemara relates that <b>Mar,</b> a Sage <b>from Mashkhei, brought sky-blue</b> wool <b>in the years</b> when <b>Rav Aḥai</b> was a preeminent Sage. <b>They tested it in</b> the manner described by <b>Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, and its color faded.</b> They then tested it <b>in</b> the manner described by <b>Rav Adda and</b> the color <b>changed for the better.</b>

### Part 5
The Sages <b>thought</b> that the sky-blue wool should be <b>deemed unfit</b> because it did not pass the first test. <b>Rav Aḥai said to them: But</b> how could it be that <b>this</b> wool <b>is not <i>tekhelet</i>,</b> as it failed one of the tests, <b>and is</b> also <b>not indigo,</b> as it passed the other? This is impossible, because it must be one or the other. <b>Rather, conclude from it</b> that these <b><i>halakhot</i> were stated together.</b>

### Part 6
He explains: In a case <b>where we tested</b> the wool <b>in</b> the manner described <b>by Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda,</b> and <b>its color did not fade,</b> it is <b>fit</b> and requires no further testing. If <b>its color faded,</b> then <b>we test it in</b> the manner described <b>by Rav Adda, with hard leavened</b> barley dough. If the color <b>changed for the better</b> it is <b>fit;</b> if the color changed <b>for the worse</b> it is <b>unfit.</b> The Gemara adds: <b>They sent</b> a message <b>from there,</b> i.e., Eretz Yisrael: These <b><i>halakhot</i> were</b> in fact <b>stated together,</b> as explained by Rav Aḥai.

### Part 7
The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Mani was exacting and purchased</b> sky-blue wool <b>in accordance with the stringencies of the <i>baraita</i></b> cited earlier, i.e., that wool dyed as a test is unfit for ritual fringes, and that therefore one should purchase sky-blue wool for ritual fringes only from an expert. <b>A certain elder said to him: This is what your early predecessors did, and their businesses were successful.</b>

### Part 8
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who purchases a cloak with ritual fringes from the marketplace,</b> if he purchased it <b>from a Jew it retains its presumptive status</b> that it is fit for the mitzva. If he purchased it <b>from a gentile,</b> then if he purchased it <b>from a merchant</b> it is presumed to be <b>fit,</b> as the merchant would want to maintain his credibility and would therefore purchase the sky-blue strings only from a reliable source. But if he purchased it <b>from</b> a gentile who is <b>an ordinary</b> person rather than a professional merchant, the sky-blue strings are <b>unfit,</b> as the seller presumably dyed them himself.

### Part 9
<b>And even though</b> the Sages <b>said: A person is not permitted to sell a cloak with ritual fringes to a gentile until he unties</b> and removes <b>its ritual fringes,</b> it is permitted to purchase such a cloak from a gentile merchant, as it is assumed that the merchant acquired the cloak from a Jew who ignored this <i>halakha</i>.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the prohibition against selling a cloak with ritual fringes to a gentile? The Gemara answers: <b>Here they interpreted</b> that it is prohibited <b>because</b> of the concern that the gentile will visit <b>a prostitute</b> and observers will think that he is a Jew. Alternatively, <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> It is prohibited <b>lest</b> a Jew mistake the gentile for a Jew and <b>accompany him on a journey</b> thinking that he is also Jewish, due to his ritual fringes, <b>and</b> the gentile might then <b>kill him.</b>

### Part 11
§ <b>Rav Yehuda would affix</b> white and <b>sky-blue</b> strings <b>to the garment [<i>pirzuma</i>] of his wife. And every morning</b> he would <b>recite the blessing: To wrap ourselves in</b> garments with <b>ritual fringes.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that</b> he would <b>affix</b> ritual fringes to his wife’s garments, it is apparent that <b>he holds</b> that the obligation of ritual fringes is <b>a positive mitzva that is not time-bound,</b> and therefore women are also obligated in it. But if that is his opinion, <b>why</b> did <b>he recite the blessing</b> on ritual fringes <b>each and every morning?</b> In order for the mitzva to not be time-bound, it must apply at night, in which case a new blessing should not be recited in the morning.

### Part 13
The Gemara answers: Rav Yehuda was acting <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>phylacteries, every time one dons them he recites the blessing over them,</b> even several times in one day; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> he should have <b>also</b> recited a blessing <b>every time</b> that he took the cloak off and put it back on, and not merely once a day in the morning. The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Yehuda was a modest man and he did not remove his cloak the entire day.</b> The Gemara asks: In <b>what</b> way is it <b>different from the morning,</b> i.e., why did he recite a blessing in the morning? The Gemara answers: He recited the blessing in the morning <b>when he changed from a nighttime garment to a daytime garment.</b>

### Part 15
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Everyone is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>ritual fringes,</b> including <b>priests, Levites, Israelites, converts, women, and</b> Canaanite <b>slaves. Rabbi Shimon deems women exempt, because</b> the mitzva of ritual fringes <b>is a positive, time-bound mitzva, and women are exempt</b> from <b>every positive, time-bound mitzva.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Everyone is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>ritual fringes,</b> including <b>priests, Levites, and Israelites.</b> The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious? As, if priests, Levites, and Israelites were exempt</b> from the mitzva, <b>who</b> then <b>is to be obligated?</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary for</b> the <i>baraita</i> to mention that <b>priests</b> are obligated to fulfill the mitzva, as <b>it may enter your mind to say</b> as follows: <b>Since it is written: “You shall not wear diverse kinds, wool and linen together. You shall prepare yourself twisted cords</b> upon the four corners of your covering” (Deuteronomy 22:11–12), only <b>one who is not permitted to wear diverse kinds is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>ritual fringes.</b> With regard to <b>these priests, since diverse kinds are permitted for them</b> when they perform the Temple service, as the belt of the priestly vestments contains diverse kinds, <b>they should not be obligated</b> in the mitzva of ritual fringes.

### Part 18
Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that <b>although</b> the prohibition of diverse kinds is <b>permitted</b> for them <b>at the time</b> when they perform the Temple <b>service, when</b> it is <b>not the time of</b> the Temple <b>service</b> it is <b>not permitted,</b> and therefore priests are obligated in the mitzva of ritual fringes.

### Part 19
The <i>baraita</i> states that <b>Rabbi Shimon deems women exempt.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Shimon?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that with regard to ritual fringes it is stated: “And it shall be unto you for a fringe, <b>that you may look upon it</b> and remember all the commandments of the Lord” (Numbers 15:39). The term “that you may look” <b>excludes a nighttime garment,</b> as it is dark at night and it is therefore difficult to see.

### Part 20
The <i>baraita</i> continues: One may ask: <b>Do you say</b> that the verse serves to <b>exclude a nighttime garment? Or is it</b> to <b>exclude only the garment of a blind person,</b> who is also unable to see his ritual fringes? The <i>tanna</i> explains: <b>When</b> the verse <b>states:</b> “Of your covering, <b>with which you cover yourself”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:12), the <b>garment of a blind person is mentioned</b> as being included, as the verse already stated: “Of your covering,” and did not need to state: “With which you cover yourself.” If so, <b>how do I realize</b> the meaning of the exclusion: <b>“That you may look upon it”?</b> It must <b>exclude a nighttime garment.</b>

### Part 21
The Gemara asks: <b>What did you see</b> that led you <b>to include the garment of a blind person</b> from the phrase: “With which you cover yourself,” <b>and to exclude a nighttime garment</b> from the phrase: “That you may look upon it,” rather than including a nighttime garment in the obligation and excluding the garment of a blind person? The Gemara answers: <b>I include the garment of a blind person, which is visible to others,</b> even though the blind person himself cannot see it, <b>and I exclude a nighttime garment, which is not visible</b> even <b>to others.</b>

### Part 22
The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis</b> who disagree with Rabbi Shimon,
