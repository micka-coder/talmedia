### Part 1
if a rite performed during the night preceding its appointed time is not considered a rite whose time has not yet arrived, then <b>when the night arrives,</b> i.e., the <b>twilight</b> of Shabbat eve, the arrangement of loaves remaining on the Table should <b>be consecrated and</b> subsequently <b>disqualified</b> by being left overnight. <b>Rava says:</b> The mishna is referring <b>to</b> a case <b>where</b> the priest <b>removed</b> the shewbread from the Table <b>before</b> nightfall on Shabbat eve in order to prevent its consecration, and arranged it again the following day.

### Part 2
<b>Mar Zutra, and some say Rav Ashi, said: Even</b> if <b>you say</b> the mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> one <b>did not remove</b> the shewbread <b>before</b> nightfall, the loaves are not consecrated by the Table. <b>Since</b> the priest <b>arranged</b> the shewbread at a time <b>that was not in accordance with</b> the procedure dictated by <b>its mitzva, it is considered as though a monkey had arranged</b> the shewbread, and it is not consecrated by the Table.

### Part 3
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The two loaves</b> that are brought on <i>Shavuot</i> <b>are eaten</b> by the priests <b>no less than two</b> days <b>and no more than three</b> days after they were baked. <b>How so? They are</b> generally <b>baked on the eve of the festival</b> of <i>Shavuot</i> and <b>they are eaten on the</b> day of the <b>Festival,</b> which is <b>on the second</b> day. If <b>the Festival occurs after Shabbat,</b> on Sunday, the loaves are baked on Friday, in which case <b>they are eaten on the third</b> day.

### Part 4
<b>The shewbread is eaten no less than nine</b> days <b>and no more than eleven</b> days after it is baked. <b>How so? It is</b> generally <b>baked on Shabbat eve and eaten on the</b> following <b>Shabbat,</b> which is <b>on the ninth</b> day. If <b>a Festival occurs on Shabbat eve</b> the shewbread is baked on the eve of the Festival, on Thursday, in which case <b>it is eaten on the tenth</b> day.

### Part 5
If the <b>two festival days of Rosh HaShana</b> occur on Thursday and Friday, the shewbread is baked on Wednesday, in which case <b>it is eaten on the eleventh</b> day. <b>And</b> this is because the preparation of the two loaves and the shewbread <b>overrides neither Shabbat nor a Festival. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says in the name of Rabbi Shimon, son of the deputy</b> High Priest: Their preparation <b>overrides a Festival but does not override</b> the <b>fast day</b> of Yom Kippur.

### Part 6
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Ravina said: According to the statement of the one who says vow offerings and voluntary offerings may not be sacrificed on a Festival, do not say they are fit</b> to be sacrificed on a Festival <b>by Torah law and it is the Sages who decreed</b> they may not be sacrificed. The Sages might have issued such a decree so <b>that</b> one <b>would not delay</b> sacrificing his offerings until he ascends to Jerusalem for the Festival. <b>Rather,</b> vow offerings and voluntary offerings <b>are unfit</b> to be sacrificed on a Festival <b>also by Torah law.</b>

### Part 7
Ravina explains this may be inferred from the mishna, <b>as</b> the offering of <b>the two loaves is an obligation of the day</b> of <i>Shavuot</i>. It is therefore <b>not</b> possible <b>to say</b> that the Sages decreed they may not be prepared on the Festival <b>lest</b> one <b>delay</b> bringing them. <b>And</b> yet the mishna <b>teaches</b> that baking and preparing the two loaves <b>overrides neither Shabbat nor a Festival.</b> All the more so that vow offerings and voluntary offerings, which do not need to be sacrificed specifically on a Festival, may not be sacrificed on a Festival by Torah law.
