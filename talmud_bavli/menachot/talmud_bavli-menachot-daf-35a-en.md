### Part 1
<b>unless</b> it is a case where one exchanges <b>an inner</b> passage <b>for an outer</b> one, e.g., he placed the passage of Exodus 13:11–16 to the right of Exodus 13:1–10, <b>or an outer</b> passage <b>for an inner one,</b> e.g., he placed the passage of Deuteronomy 11:13–21 to the right of Deuteronomy 6:4–9. <b>But</b> if one exchanges <b>an inner</b> passage <b>for</b> the other <b>inner</b> one, i.e., he exchanges Exodus 13:11–16 with Deuteronomy 6:4–9, <b>or an outer</b> passage <b>for</b> the other <b>outer</b> one, i.e., he exchanges Exodus 13:1–10 with Deuteronomy 11:13–21, <b>we have no</b> problem <b>with it.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rava said to</b> Abaye: <b>What is different</b> about the cases of exchanging <b>an inner</b> passage <b>for an outer</b> one, <b>and an outer</b> passage <b>for an inner</b> one, such <b>that</b> the phylacteries are <b>not</b> fit? The reason is <b>that this</b> passage, <b>which needs to see the air,</b> i.e., to be placed on the outer side, <b>does not see</b> it, <b>and that</b> passage, <b>which does not need to see the air, does see it.</b> But in a case where one exchanges <b>an outer</b> passage <b>for</b> the other <b>outer</b> one <b>or an inner</b> passage <b>for</b> the other <b>inner</b> one, it should be unfit <b>as well,</b> as <b>this</b> passage, <b>which needs to see the air of</b> the <b>right</b> side, <b>sees the air of</b> the <b>left</b> side, <b>and</b> that passage, which requires to see the air <b>of</b> the <b>left</b> side, <b>sees the air of</b> the <b>right</b> side. <b>Rather,</b> there <b>is no difference</b> between any of these cases, and any change in the order renders the phylacteries unfit.

### Part 3
§ <b>And Rav Ḥananel says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The requirement to have <b>the <i>titora</i> of phylacteries,</b> i.e., the base of phylacteries upon which the compartments rest, is <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai. Abaye said:</b> The requirement to have <b>the <i>ma’ebarta</i> of phylacteries,</b> i.e., the passageway through which the straps are inserted, is <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai. And Abaye says:</b> The requirement to have a letter <b><i>shin</i></b> protruding <b>on</b> the <b>phylacteries</b> of one’s head, which is achieved by pressing the hide into the shape of that letter, is <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai.</b>

### Part 4
Abaye further says: <b>And there is a requirement that</b> the <b>furrow</b> between each of the compartments of phylacteries of the head <b>reach the place of the stitches,</b> i.e., the <i>titora</i>, to which the compartments are sewn. <b>Rav Dimi of Neharde’a says: Once it is noticeable</b> that there is a furrow between each of the compartments, <b>it is not necessary</b> for them to reach all the way to the <i>titora</i>.

### Part 5
<b>And Abaye says:</b> With regard to <b>this parchment</b> upon which one writes the passages <b>of phylacteries,</b> the scribe <b>must examine it</b> before writing, <b>as perhaps it has a flaw,</b> i.e., a perforation, <b>and complete writing is required, and</b> that requirement would <b>not</b> be fulfilled if a letter were perforated. <b>Rav Dimi of Neharde’a says: No</b> prior examination is <b>required;</b> rather, <b>the quill examines it</b> as one writes, as any perforation which the ink covers is disregarded.

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says:</b> The requirement that the <b>straps</b> of the phylacteries be <b>black</b> is <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai.</b> The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may tie phylacteries only</b> with straps <b>of their</b> same <b>type,</b> i.e., the straps must be made from hide, and it does not matter <b>whether</b> they are <b>green, or black, or white.</b> Nevertheless, <b>one should not make red</b> straps, <b>because</b> this is <b>deprecatory</b> to him, as it looks like he has wounds on his head, <b>and</b> also due to <b>something else,</b> i.e., lest people suspect him of engaging in sexual intercourse with a menstruating woman and getting blood on the straps.

### Part 7
The Gemara cites the continuation of that <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> There was <b>an incident involving Rabbi Akiva’s student, who would tie his phylacteries with strips of sky</b>-<b>blue wool</b> rather than hide, <b>and</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>did not say anything to him.</b> Is it <b>possible</b> that <b>that righteous man saw his student</b> doing something improper <b>and he did not object to his</b> conduct? Another Sage <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda: <b>Yes,</b> it is possible that the student acted improperly, as Rabbi Akiva <b>did not see him, and if he had seen him, he would not have allowed him</b> to do so.

### Part 8
The <i>baraita</i> continues: There was <b>an incident involving Hyrcanus, the son of Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus, who would tie his phylacteries with strips of purple wool, and</b> his father <b>did not say anything to him.</b> Is it <b>possible</b> that <b>that righteous man saw his son</b> doing something improper <b>and he did not object to his</b> conduct? The Sages <b>said to him: Yes,</b> it is possible that his son acted improperly, as Rabbi Eliezer <b>did not see him, and if he had seen him, he would not have allowed him</b> to do so. This concludes the <i>baraita</i>.

### Part 9
The Gemara explains the objection from the <i>baraita</i>: <b>In any event,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that it does not matter <b>whether</b> the straps are <b>green, or black, or white,</b> whereas Rabbi Yitzḥak maintains that it is a <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai that the straps of the phylacteries must be black. The Gemara answers that it is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>the inside</b> of the straps, which touch the body. These may be any color other than red. Conversely, <b>there,</b> when Rabbi Yitzḥak says that the straps of the phylacteries must be black, he is speaking of <b>the outside</b> of the straps.

### Part 10
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If</b> the <i>baraita</i> is discussing <b>the inside</b> of the straps, <b>what deprecatory</b> matter <b>or</b> problem of <b>something else is there</b> with straps that are red on the inside? After all, this side is not seen. The Gemara answers: <b>Sometimes his</b> straps <b>become reversed,</b> and therefore these concerns are applicable.

### Part 11
It is <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The requirement that <b>phylacteries</b> be <b>square</b> is <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai. Rav Pappa says</b> about this <i>halakha</i>: Square means <b>along their seams and their diagonals,</b> i.e., they must be perfectly square where the compartments are sewn to the <i>titora</i>.

### Part 12
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that a mishna <b>supports</b> this opinion (<i>Megilla</i> 24b): <b>One who fashions his phylacteries</b> in <b>a round</b> shape exposes himself to <b>danger, and it</b> does <b>not</b> enable him to fulfill the <b>mitzva</b> of phylacteries. <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> This is no support, as one can say that <b>the mishna</b> is referring to phylacteries <b>that are fashioned like a nut,</b> i.e., their underside is rounded, and therefore there is a danger that if he strikes his head on a wall the underside will press into his head and injure him. By contrast, if the underside is flat one might have thought that it is fit despite the fact that it is not square. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> teaches that phylacteries must be square.

### Part 13
§ <b>Rav Huna says:</b> With regard to <b>phylacteries</b> of the head, <b>as long as the surface of outer hide is intact,</b> i.e., it is not torn, <b>they are fit,</b> even if the hide between the compartments has torn. <b>Rav Ḥisda says:</b> If <b>two</b> of the walls between the compartments <b>tore,</b> such phylacteries <b>are fit,</b> but if <b>three</b> of these inner walls tore, <b>they are unfit.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Rava said:</b> Concerning <b>that which you said,</b> that if <b>two</b> of the walls between the compartments tore <b>they are fit, we said</b> this <b>only</b> if the inner walls that tore are <b>not aligned with each other,</b> i.e., they are not adjacent to one another. <b>But</b> if the torn walls are <b>aligned with each other,</b> the phylacteries <b>are unfit. And</b> furthermore, <b>even</b> in a case where the torn walls are <b>aligned with each other, we said</b> that they are unfit <b>only with regard to new</b> phylacteries, as the hide is certainly defective. <b>But with regard to old</b> phylacteries, <b>we have no</b> problem <b>with it,</b> as they tore due to aging.

### Part 15
<b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: What are the circumstances</b> of <b>new</b> phylacteries, <b>and what are the circumstances</b> of <b>old</b> phylacteries? Rav Yosef <b>said to him:</b> In <b>any</b> case <b>where if one holds the hide and pulls it, it returns to its place [<i>ḥaleim</i>],</b> these phylacteries are considered <b>old; and</b> in <b>the other</b> case, where hide that was pulled does not return to its place, they are considered <b>new.</b>
