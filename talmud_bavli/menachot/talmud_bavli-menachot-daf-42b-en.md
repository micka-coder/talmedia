### Part 1
<b>of Pashronya: A Torah scroll, phylacteries, or <i>mezuzot</i> that were written by a heretic, a Samaritan, a gentile,</b> a Canaanite <b>slave, a woman, a minor, or a Jewish apostate [<i>meshummad</i>] are unfit, as it is stated: “And you shall bind them</b> for a sign on your arm…<b>and you shall write them</b> on the doorposts of your house” (Deuteronomy 6:8–9). From this juxtaposition, one can derive the following: <b>Anyone who is</b> included <b>in</b> the mitzva of <b>binding</b> the phylacteries, i.e., one who is both obligated and performs the mitzva, <b>is</b> included <b>in</b> the class of people who may <b>write</b> Torah scrolls, phylacteries, and <i>mezuzot</i>; and <b>anyone who is not</b> included <b>in</b> the mitzva of <b>binding is not</b> included <b>in</b> the class of people who may <b>write</b> sacred texts.

### Part 2
<b>And</b> despite the fact that phylacteries written by a gentile are unfit, <b>a Jew</b> who writes them <b>does not have to recite a blessing. As Rav Ḥiyya, son of Rav Huna, sent</b> a ruling <b>in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: On phylacteries of the arm</b> one <b>says</b> the blessing: <b>Blessed</b> are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, W<b>ho has sanctified us through His mitzvot and commanded us to don phylacteries. On phylacteries of the head</b> one <b>says</b> the blessing: <b>Blessed</b> are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, <b>Who has sanctified us through His mitzvot and commanded us concerning the mitzva of phylacteries.</b> The implication of this is that one recites blessings only when he dons the phylacteries, <b>whereas</b> when he writes the phylacteries he <b>does not recite a blessing: To prepare phylacteries.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rather, isn’t this the reason</b> for the distinction between different mitzvot: For <b>any mitzva whose performance is the completion of</b> the <b>mitzva, such as circumcision, even though it is valid</b> when performed <b>by a gentile,</b> when it is performed <b>by a Jew he must recite a blessing. But</b> for <b>any mitzva where the performance of</b> a particular act <b>is not the completion of</b> the <b>mitzva, such as</b> writing <b>phylacteries,</b> where one does not complete the mitzva until he dons them, <b>even though it is not valid</b> when performed <b>by a gentile,</b> when it is performed <b>by a Jew he does not need to recite a blessing.</b>

### Part 4
<b>And with regard to</b> reciting a blessing when one attaches <b>ritual fringes</b> to a garment, the Sages <b>disagree about this:</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rav Adda bar Ahava, <b>holds</b> that <b>it is an obligation</b> pertaining to the <b>cloak.</b> Therefore, when one attaches the ritual fringes he is completing the mitzva, and he should recite a blessing: To prepare ritual fringes. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rav Naḥman, citing Rav, <b>holds</b> that <b>it is an obligation</b> incumbent upon <b>the man.</b> Consequently, the mitzva is not complete until he wears the garment, and he should not recite a blessing when he attaches the ritual fringes to the garment.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Mordekhai said to Rav Ashi: You teach this</b> <i>halakha</i> about gentiles attaching ritual fringes to a garment <b>in this manner,</b> citing Rav Yehuda in the name of Rav that the ritual fringes are invalid. Consequently, Rav Ḥisda raises a contradiction between this ruling and another ruling of Rav.

### Part 6
<b>We teach it in this way,</b> according to which there is no contradiction: <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: From where</b> is it derived that if <b>ritual fringes</b> are attached to a garment <b>by a gentile</b> they are <b>valid?</b> It is derived from <b>that</b> which <b>is stated: “Speak unto the children of Israel</b> and command them <b>that they prepare for themselves [<i>lahem</i>] strings”</b> (Numbers 15:38). From the fact that the verse does not merely state: That they prepare [<i>ve’asu</i>], but rather states “<i>ve’asu lahem</i>,” which can be translated as: That they prepare for them, the indication is that even <b>others,</b> i.e., gentiles, <b>shall prepare</b> ritual fringes <b>for them.</b>

### Part 7
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> If <b>one prepared</b> ritual fringes <b>from</b> threads that protrude from the fabric like <b>thorns [<i>kotzim</i>], or</b> if he prepared them <b>from threads [<i>nimin</i>]</b> that were used to sew the garment and remain attached to it, <b>or from the strings [<i>geradin</i>]</b> that hang from the bottom of a garment, the ritual fringes are <b>unfit,</b> as one must attach ritual fringes to a garment for the sake of the mitzva. But if he prepared ritual fringes <b>from swatches</b> of wool that were not spun for the sake of the mitzva, they are <b>fit.</b>

### Part 8
Rav Yehuda continues: <b>When I stated this</b> <i>halakha</i> in the name of Rav <b>before Shmuel,</b> he <b>said</b> to me: <b>Even</b> ritual fringes tied <b>from swatches</b> of wool that were not spun for the sake of the mitzva are <b>unfit,</b> as <b>we require the spinning</b> of the string to be <b>for the sake of</b> the mitzva.

### Part 9
The Gemara notes that this dispute <b>is like</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: If one took phylacteries and <b>coated them</b> with <b>gold or patched them</b> with the <b>skin of a non-kosher animal,</b> then <b>they are unfit.</b> But if one patched them with the <b>skin of a kosher animal,</b> then <b>they are fit, and</b> this is so <b>even though he did not prepare</b> the skin <b>for their sake,</b> i.e., for the sake of its use in a mitzva. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Even</b> if he patched them with the <b>skin of a kosher animal they are unfit, until he prepares them for their sake.</b>

### Part 10
§ <b>Abaye said to Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yehuda: How do you dye this sky-blue wool</b> to be used for ritual fringes? Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yehuda <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>We bring blood of a <i>ḥilazon</i> and</b> various <b>herbs and put them in a pot</b> and boil them. <b>And</b> then <b>we take a bit</b> of the resulting dye <b>in an egg</b> shell <b>and test it by</b> using it to dye <b>a wad</b> of wool to see if it has attained the desired hue. <b>And</b> then <b>we throw</b> away <b>that egg</b> shell and its contents <b>and burn the wad</b> of wool.

### Part 11
The Gemara comments: <b>Learn from</b> this statement <b>three</b> <i>halakhot</i>: <b>Learn from it</b> that wool that was dyed for the purpose of <b>testing</b> the dye and not for use as ritual fringes is <b>unfit</b> for ritual fringes. Consequently, one burns the wad of wool so that no one will use it for ritual fringes. <b>And learn from it that we require dyeing for the sake of</b> the mitzva. <b>And learn from it</b> that using dye for <b>testing renders</b> all the dye in that vessel <b>unfit.</b> Therefore, some of the dye is removed from the pot before it is tested.

### Part 12
The Gemara challenges: The <i>halakha</i> that wool dyed for the purpose of <b>testing</b> the dye is <b>unfit is</b> the same as the requirement of <b>dyeing for the sake of</b> the mitzva. It is only because the sky-blue strings must be dyed for the sake of the mitzva that wool dyed as a test is unfit for use as ritual fringes, so why are these stated as two <i>halakhot</i>? <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The statement about learning three <i>halakhot</i> <b>employs</b> the style known as: <b>What is the reason,</b> and it means: <b>What is the reason</b> that wool that was dyed for the purpose of <b>testing</b> is <b>unfit?</b> It is <b>because we require dyeing for the sake of</b> the mitzva.

### Part 13
The Gemara notes that the <i>halakha</i> that using the dye for testing renders all the dye in the pot unfit is <b>subject to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <i>Tekhelet</i> dye that was used for <b>testing</b> is <b>unfit, as it is stated</b> concerning the priestly vestments: “And you shall make the robe of the ephod <b>entirely of blue [<i>kelil tekhelet</i>]”</b> (Exodus 28:31), which indicates that the dye must be used exclusively for this purpose, i.e., this must be the first item it is being used to dye. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Dahavai says: Even a second appearance</b> caused by the dye <b>is fit,</b> meaning even if it is the second time that the dye is being used, it is still fit. <b>As it is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“And scarlet wool [<i>ushni tola’at</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 14:4), which is interpreted to mean that this may be the second [<i>sheni</i>] usage of the dye.

### Part 15
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>There is no</b> reliable method of <b>testing sky-blue wool, and</b> therefore <b>it may be purchased only from an expert. There is</b> a method of <b>testing phylacteries</b> to ensure they were written properly, <b>but</b> nevertheless <b>they may be purchased only from an expert. There is</b> a method of <b>testing Torah scrolls and <i>mezuzot</i>, and they may be purchased from anyone.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>And is there no</b> method for <b>testing sky-blue wool? But didn’t Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, test it</b> to ensure it was dyed with <i>tekhelet</i>? The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for the test, which was carried out <b>with</b> items whose names contain the letters <b><i>gimmel</i>, <i>shin</i>,</b> or <b><i>mem</i>.</b> He would <b>bring alum clay [<i>megavya gila</i>], and water of fenugreek [<i>shavlilta</i>], and urine [<i>meimei raglayim</i>]</b>
