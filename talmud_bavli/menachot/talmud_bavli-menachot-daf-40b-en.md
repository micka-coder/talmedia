### Part 1
with regard to the prohibitions against eating <b>leavened bread on Passover and</b> eating on <b>Yom Kippur, which</b> are punishable by <b><i>karet</i>, we rely on letters</b> sent from the rabbinical court in Eretz Yisrael publicizing whether the year was declared a leap year and when they have declared the New Moon; <b>here,</b> with regard to the mitzva of ritual fringes, <b>which</b> is <b>merely a positive mitzva,</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> correct that letters can be relied on?

### Part 2
<b>Rather, Rava said: This is a statement</b> that <b>I said, and it was stated in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>in the name of Rabbi Zeira in accordance with my</b> opinion: The reason for the rabbinic decree is <b>lest</b> one’s <b>cloak rip within three</b> fingerbreadths of the edge of the corner of the garment, which is where the ritual fringes are placed, <b>and he sew it</b> with linen string and then use the excess string for ritual fringes.

### Part 3
<b>And</b> in such a case the ritual fringes would be unfit because <b>the Torah states:</b> “You shall prepare yourself twisted cords” (Deuteronomy 22:12), which teaches: <b>Prepare</b> it, <b>and not from what has already been prepared.</b> Consequently, the strings must be attached to the garment for the sake of the mitzva of ritual fringes. When the individual places the linen string there in order to stitch the garment and then decides to use it for the mitzva of ritual fringes and adds sky-blue wool strings, he does not fulfill the mitzva of ritual fringes and violates the prohibition against wearing a garment of wool and linen.

### Part 4
Because of this rabbinic decree, <b>Rabbi Zeira untied</b> the ritual fringes and removed them from <b>his</b> linen <b>cloak. Rav Zeira said:</b> The rabbinic <b>decree</b> prohibiting ritual fringes on a linen garment is <b>also due to</b> the concern that one might affix ritual fringes to <b>a nighttime garment.</b> Since the mitzva of ritual fringes does not apply in that case, if one wears the garment he would not fulfill the mitzva and would violate the prohibition against wearing a garment with wool and linen.

### Part 5
<b>And Rava said: This is a statement</b> that <b>I said, and it was stated in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>in the name of Rabbi Zeira in accordance with my</b> opinion: If a garment is made <b>from cloth and its corners</b> are made <b>from leather,</b> it is <b>required</b> to have ritual fringes. Conversely, if a cloak is made <b>from leather and its corners</b> are made <b>from cloth,</b> it is <b>exempt</b> from the mitzva of ritual fringes. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>We require</b> that <b>the main</b> part of the <b>garment</b> be obligated, and a leather garment is not required to have ritual fringes.

### Part 6
The Gemara notes: <b>Rav Aḥai</b> would <b>follow the corner</b> in determining whether the garment is required to have ritual fringes or not, because the Torah states: “On the corners of their garments” (Numbers 15:38).

### Part 7
§ <b>Rava says</b> that <b>Rav Seḥora says</b> that <b>Rav Huna says:</b> In a case where one <b>affixed</b> ritual fringes <b>to</b> a garment <b>possessing</b> only <b>three</b> corners, which is not required to have ritual fringes, <b>and</b> then <b>completed</b> its <b>fourth</b> corner by sewing on additional material or cutting away some of the material, the ritual fringes he attached to the original three corners are <b>unfit.</b> This is due to the principle: <b>Prepare</b> it, <b>and not from what has already been prepared.</b> Once the garment is required to have ritual fringes one may attach the ritual fringes; the strings that were attached before the garment was required to have them are not fit.

### Part 8
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: It is told of <b>the early</b> generations of <b>pious</b> men that <b>once they weaved three</b> fingerbreadths of the length of the garment, <b>they would affix</b> the white and <b>sky-blue</b> strings <b>to</b> the first two corners, even though the garment was not yet long enough to be obligated to have ritual fringes. The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> should read as follows: <b>Once they completed [<i>shepatzu</i>]</b> the garment until there were only <b>three</b> fingerbreadths left to weave, <b>they would affix</b> the white and <b>sky-blue</b> strings <b>to</b> the first two corners.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>And do we say: Prepare</b> it, <b>and not from what has already been prepared? Is that so</b> that this principle disqualifies ritual fringes that one affixed to a garment before he was required to do so? <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Zeira say:</b> If one <b>affixed</b> ritual fringes <b>to</b> a garment that already had ritual fringes <b>affixed</b> to it and then removed the original strings, it is <b>fit,</b> despite the fact that when he attached the second set they were superfluous? This indicates that even if one attaches ritual fringes to a garment when there is no obligation to attach them, the ritual fringes are fit.

### Part 10
<b>Rava said:</b> This does not present a difficulty, because <b>now</b> that he adds a second, unnecessary set of ritual fringes and <b>is</b> liable <b>for</b> violating the <b>prohibition of adding</b> to a mitzva (see Deuteronomy 13:1), <b>is</b> it <b>not</b> considered <b>an action?</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rav Pappa objects to this: From where</b> is it known <b>that</b> Rabbi Zeira is discussing a case where the <b>person intended to add</b> to the original set of ritual fringes? <b>Perhaps</b> Rabbi Zeira is discussing a case where <b>he intended to nullify</b> the original strings, <b>and</b> therefore <b>there is no prohibition of adding</b> to a mitzva, and <b>there is an action.</b>

### Part 12
With regard to the issue of affixing ritual fringes to a garment that already has ritual fringes, the Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Zeira says</b> that <b>Rav Mattana says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> White and <b>sky-blue</b> strings <b>are not subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>diverse kinds, and</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> if they are affixed <b>to a cloak</b> that is <b>exempt</b> from ritual fringes.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is meant by: <b>A cloak</b> that is <b>exempt</b> from ritual fringes? <b>If we say</b> that it is referring to a cloak <b>that is not of the size</b> necessary to require the affixing of ritual fringes, that is difficult: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a cloak that</b> is large enough for <b>a minor</b> to <b>cover his head and most of his</b> body <b>with</b> it,
