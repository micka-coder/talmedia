<b>but a community may bring</b> incense as a gift offering, <b>as</b> the community <b>does bring its obligatory</b> offering <b>similar to this,</b> i.e., since the community is obligated to sacrifice incense it can also voluntarily sacrifice incense. Therefore, <b>the verse states: You shall not bring [<i>lo ta’alu</i>]</b> strange incense thereon” (Exodus 30:9). The fact that the verse formulates the prohibition with the plural word <i>ta’alu</i> indicates that even the community may not sacrifice incense as a voluntary gift offering.

### Part 2
The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that the community <b>may not bring</b> a gift offering of incense <b>on the inner altar, but</b> it <b>may bring</b> incense <b>on the external altar.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And the anointing oil, and the incense of sweet spices for the sacred place; according to all that I have commanded you shall they do”</b> (Exodus 31:11). This teaches that one <b>has</b> the right to do <b>only that which is stated with regard to the matter,</b> without deviation. Consequently, incense may sacrificed only by the community, only when there is an obligation to sacrifice it, and it must be burned only on the inner altar. This contradicts the implication of the previously cited <i>baraita</i> that it is permitted to burn the incense of an individual on the golden altar or the incense of a community on the outer altar.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> This is not problematic. The <i>baraita</i> <b>is speaking</b> utilizing the style of: <b>It is not necessary,</b> as follows. <b>It is not necessary</b> to state that <b>the community</b> may not sacrifice incense <b>on the external altar, as we have not found</b> a precedent for it. <b>And</b> similarly, <b>it is not necessary</b> to state that <b>an individual</b> may not sacrifice incense <b>on the inner altar, as we have not found</b> a precedent for it. <b>But</b> it is necessary to state that it is <b>even</b> prohibited for <b>an individual</b> to sacrifice incense <b>on the external altar,</b> despite the fact <b>that we have</b> ostensibly <b>found</b> a precedent for it <b>in</b> the case of <b>the</b> tribal <b>princes;</b> as that <b>was a provisional edict</b> and therefore cannot serve as a precedent.

### Part 4
mishna The twelve loaves of <i>matza</i> prepared from a tenth of an ephah of flour of the <b>griddle-cake</b> offering <b>of the High Priest did not come</b> from the house of the High Priest <b>in halves. Rather,</b> the High Priest <b>brings</b> from his house <b>a complete tenth</b> of an ephah of flour (see Leviticus 6:13) <b>and divides it</b> in half, and he <b>sacrifices half in the morning and half in the afternoon.</b>

### Part 5
In the case of a High <b>Priest who brings</b> and sacrifices <b>half in the morning and dies, and they appointed another</b> High <b>Priest in his stead,</b> the replacement High Priest <b>should neither bring half of a tenth</b> of an ephah of flour <b>from his house nor</b> sacrifice the remaining <b>half of</b> the <b>tenth of an ephah of</b> his <b>predecessor. Rather, he brings</b> from his house <b>an entire tenth</b> of an ephah <b>and divides it</b> in half, <b>sacrifices half, and</b> the other <b>half</b> is not sacrificed and <b>is lost. Consequently, two halves</b> of a tenth of an ephah <b>are sacrificed,</b> one-half of what was brought by each priest, <b>and</b> the other <b>two halves are lost.</b>

### Part 6
gemara The Gemara cites that which <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, commenting on the verse: “This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer to the Lord on the day when he is anointed: The tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering perpetually, half of it in the morning, and half of it in the evening” (Leviticus 6:13). <b>If</b> the verse had <b>stated: A meal offering</b> perpetually, <b>half</b> in the morning and half in the evening; <b>I would have said</b> that the High Priest <b>brings half of a tenth</b> of an ephah <b>in the morning and sacrifices</b> it, and then he brings <b>half of a tenth</b> of an ephah <b>in the afternoon and sacrifices</b> it.

### Part 7
Since <b>the verse states: “Half of it in the morning, and half of it in the evening”</b> (Leviticus 6:13), it teaches that <b>he sacrifices half of a complete</b> tenth of an ephah. <b>How so?</b> The High Priest <b>brings</b> from his house <b>a complete tenth</b> of an ephah of fine flour, <b>and divides it</b> in half, <b>and sacrifices half in the morning and half in the afternoon.</b>

### Part 8
In a case where the <b>half of</b> a tenth of an ephah that was supposed to be offered in <b>the afternoon became impure or was lost</b> after the High Priest sacrificed the first half in the morning, one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he should bring half of a tenth</b> of an ephah <b>from his house and sacrifice</b> it. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Half of it in the morning, and half of it in the evening,”</b> which teaches that <b>he brings half of a complete</b> tenth of an ephah.

### Part 9
<b>How so?</b> The High Priest <b>brings a complete tenth</b> of an ephah of fine flour <b>from his house and divides it</b> in half, <b>and he sacrifices half, and</b> the other <b>half</b> is not sacrificed and <b>is lost. Consequently, two halves</b> of a tenth of an ephah <b>are sacrificed,</b> the half that was sacrificed in the morning from the original tenth of an ephah, and half of the replacement tenth of an ephah, <b>and</b> the other <b>two halves are lost.</b>

### Part 10
In the case of a High <b>Priest who sacrificed half in the morning and died, and they appointed another</b> High <b>Priest in his stead,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that the second High Priest <b>should bring half of a tenth</b> of an ephah <b>from his house</b> and sacrifice it, <b>or</b> that he should sacrifice the remaining <b>half of a tenth</b> of an ephah <b>of the first</b> High Priest. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And half of it in the evening,”</b> which teaches that he <b>brings and sacrifices half of a complete</b> tenth of an ephah.

### Part 11
<b>How so?</b> The replacement High Priest <b>brings a complete tenth</b> of an ephah of fine flour <b>from his house and divides it</b> in half, <b>and he sacrifices</b> half, <b>and half</b> is not sacrificed and <b>is lost. Consequently, two halves</b> of a tenth of an ephah <b>are lost,</b> half of the tenth of an ephah brought by each priest, <b>and</b> the other <b>two halves are sacrificed.</b>

### Part 12
§ With regard to the two halves of a tenth of an ephah that are lost, <b>a <i>tanna</i>,</b> i.e., a Sage who recited <i>baraitot</i>, <b>taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Naḥman:</b> With regard to <b>the half</b> that was not sacrificed by the <b>first</b> High Priest, who died, <b>and the half</b> brought but not sacrificed by the <b>second</b> High Priest who replaced him, <b>their form should decay,</b> i.e., they should be left overnight so they become disqualified, <b>and</b> then they should be <b>brought out to the place</b> designated <b>for burning.</b>

### Part 13
<b>Rav Naḥman said to</b> the <i>tanna</i>: <b>Granted,</b> the half that was not sacrificed by the <b>first</b> High Priest should be left overnight before it is burned, because it was initially <b>fit for sacrifice</b> before the first High Priest died. <b>But</b> with regard to the half that was not sacrificed by the <b>second</b> High Priest, <b>why</b> must <b>it</b> be left overnight so that its <b>form decays?</b> It was <b>brought to be lost from the outset,</b> i.e., when the full tenth of an ephah was brought it was known that only half would be sacrificed and half would be lost. Consequently, it is unnecessary to leave it overnight before burning it.

### Part 14
Rav Naḥman continued: <b>Who is</b> the one <b>who said</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>to you? It was the <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabba bar Avuh, who says:</b> All disqualified offerings, <b>even <i>piggul</i>,</b> which is disqualified by Torah law, <b>require decay of form</b> before they are burned.

### Part 15
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> can be understood <b>even</b> if <b>you say</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> who disagree with Rabba bar Avuh and hold that <i>piggul</i> does not require decay of form. Nevertheless, <b>since at the time when</b> the second High Priest <b>divides the</b> two halves, <b>if he wants</b> he can <b>sacrifice this</b> half, <b>and if he wants</b> he can <b>sacrifice that</b> other half, both halves are considered <b>fit</b> to be sacrificed and may not be burned until they are left overnight.

### Part 16
§ The Gemara cites that which <b>was stated</b> further about the griddle-cake offering: <b>How are the griddle-cake</b> offerings of <b>the High Priest prepared?</b> The verse seems to prescribe a variety of methods of preparation: “On a griddle it shall be made with oil; when it is soaked, you shall bring it in; and baked pieces [<i>tufinei</i>] of the meal offering shall you sacrifice for a pleasing aroma to the Lord” (Leviticus 6:14). <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba</b> says that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that it is prepared in the following manner: The individual preparing it <b>bakes it</b> in an oven <b>and afterward he fries it</b> in a pan. <b>Rabbi Asi</b> says that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says</b> that it is prepared in the following manner: The individual preparing it <b>fries it</b> in a pan <b>and afterward he bakes</b> it in an oven.

### Part 17
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: It stands to reason in accordance with my</b> opinion because the verse states: “And baked pieces [<i>tufinei</i>] of the meal offering.” The word for <b>baked pieces [<i>tufinei</i>]</b> should be understood as meaning that <b>they shall be baked</b> when they are still <b>beautiful [<i>te’afena na’a</i>],</b> i.e., before being fried. <b>Rabbi Asi said: It stands to reason in accordance with my</b> opinion because the word <i>tufinei</i> should be understood as meaning that <b>they shall be baked</b> when they are already <b>partially cooked [<i>te’afena na</i>],</b> i.e., after being fried.

### Part 18
This dispute between the <i>amora’im</i> is <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i></b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The word for baked pieces [<i>tufinei</i>] should be understood as meaning that <b>they shall be baked</b> when they are already <b>partially cooked [<i>te’afena na</i>]. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> It should be understood as meaning that <b>they shall be baked</b> when they are still <b>beautiful [<i>te’afena na’a</i>]. Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The word <i>tufinei</i> is plural, indicating that the pieces <b>should be baked extensively,</b> i.e., more than once. Consequently, Rabbi Yosei <b>accepts</b> the opinion that the pieces should be baked when they are already <b>partially cooked, and he</b> also <b>accepts</b> the opinion that they should be baked when they are <b>beautiful.</b> Therefore the offering should first be baked, then fried, then baked again.

### Part 19
§ <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (96a): Concerning the twelve loaves of <b>the High Priest’s griddle-cake</b> offering, of which six are sacrificed in the morning and six in the evening, <b>their kneading, and forming of their</b> loaves, <b>and their baking are</b> performed <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>and</b> all labors involved in those actions <b>override Shabbat.</b>

### Part 20
The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter,</b> i.e., that these actions override Shabbat, derived? <b>Rav Huna said:</b> The verse says <b><i>tufinei</i>,</b> meaning that when it is already <b>baked it must</b> still <b>be beautiful [<i>te’afena na’a</i>]. And if</b> one would <b>bake it yesterday,</b> on the eve of Shabbat, <b>it</b> would become <b>swollen [<i>inshefa</i>]</b> and no longer beautiful. <b>Rav Yosef objects to this:</b> If the purpose of baking them on Shabbat is to ensure they remain fresh, <b>say that</b> the loaves should be baked before Shabbat and <b>covered with greens</b> to preserve them.

### Part 21
The Gemara cites another explanation of why the preparation of these loaves overrides Shabbat. A Sage from <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> The verse states: “On a griddle it <b>shall be made</b> with oil” (Leviticus 6:14), which teaches that it shall be made under all circumstances, <b>even on Shabbat.</b> Similarly, this phrase <b>“shall be made”</b> teaches that it should be made <b>even in</b> a state of <b>ritual impurity.</b>

### Part 22
<b>Abaye said</b> that there is a different explanation: The <b>verse states: “Fine flour for a meal offering perpetually”</b> (Leviticus 6:13);
