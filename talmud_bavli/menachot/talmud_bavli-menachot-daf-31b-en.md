### Part 1
<b>Does</b> Rabbi Ḥanina <b>say</b> that wherever Rabbi Shimon Shezuri taught a <i>halakha</i> <b>in our Mishna</b> the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with his opinion? Rather, <b>he says</b> that <b>any place where he taught</b> a <i>halakha</i> the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with his opinion, and this applies even to <i>baraitot</i>.

### Part 2
§ <b>Rav Ze’eira says</b> that <b>Rav Ḥananel says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> If <b>a tear</b> in the parchment of a Torah scroll <b>extends into two lines, one can sew</b> the parchment to render the scroll fit, but if it extends <b>into three</b> lines then <b>one cannot sew</b> it to render it fit. <b>Rabba Zuti said to Rav Ashi: This</b> is what <b>Rabbi Yirmeya of Difti said in the name of Rava: That which we say,</b> that if the tear extends <b>into three</b> lines <b>one cannot sew</b> it to render it fit, <b>we say only with regard to old</b> sheets of parchment. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>new</b> sheets of parchment, <b>we have no</b> problem <b>with it.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara adds: <b>And old</b> does <b>not</b> mean <b>literally old, and new</b> does <b>not</b> mean <b>literally new. Rather, those</b> sheets of parchment <b>that are not processed with gall</b> are labeled as old and cannot be sewn, whereas <b>those</b> sheets of parchment <b>that are processed with gall</b> are labeled as new and can be sewn. <b>And this statement,</b> that one can sew the parchment and render it fit, applies to sewing it <b>with sinew; but</b> if one sews the parchment <b>with thread [<i>bigradin</i>],</b> it is <b>not</b> rendered fit.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Yehuda bar Abba asks:</b> If the tear occurred in the space <b>between</b> one <b>column and</b> another <b>column</b> but it was of the length that had it occurred inside a column it would have extended more than three lines, and similarly, if the tear occurred <b>between</b> one <b>line and</b> another <b>line</b> horizontally, but not tearing through any letters, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? No answer was found, and therefore the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 5
§ <b>Rabbi Ze’eiri says</b> that <b>Rav Ḥananel says</b> that <b>Rav says: A <i>mezuza</i> that one wrote two</b> by <b>two,</b> i.e., two words on each line, is <b>fit. A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If one wrote <b>two</b> words on one line, <b>and three</b> words on the following line, <b>and one</b> word on the line after that, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: All the more so</b> that it is fit, <b>as he prepared it as</b> one writes <b>a poem</b> in the Torah scroll. The song sung by the Jewish people at the sea after the Exodus is written in lines whose length is not uniform. The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one wrote it as</b> one writes <b>a poem</b> in the Torah, <b>or if one wrote a poem</b> in the Torah <b>as</b> one writes it, it is <b>unfit.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>When that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught,</b> it is referring <b>to a Torah scroll,</b> not a <i>mezuza</i>.

### Part 6
It <b>was stated</b> by <i>amora’im</i> <b>as well: Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Aḥa bar bar Ḥana</b> who <b>says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>a <i>mezuza</i> that one prepared</b> with <b>two</b> words on one line, <b>and three</b> words on the following line, <b>and one</b> word on the line after that, it is <b>fit, provided that he does not prepare it like</b> the shape of <b>a tent,</b> i.e., progressively widening the lines, starting with a line of one word, then a line of two words and a line of three, <b>and provided that he does not prepare it like</b> the shape of <b>a tail,</b> progressively shortening the lines, from three words to two to one.

### Part 7
§ <b>Rav Ḥisda says:</b> One writes the last two words of a <i>mezuza</i>, <b><i>al ha’aretz</i>,</b> meaning “above the earth” (Deuteronomy 11:21), by themselves <b>on the final line,</b> without the preceding word. The Sages disagreed as to how this is done. <b>Some say</b> that one writes this phrase <b>at the end of</b> the final <b>line, and some say</b> that one writes it <b>at the beginning of</b> the final <b>line.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara explains their dispute: <b>The one who says</b> that one writes it <b>at the end of</b> the final <b>line</b> interprets the verse: “That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, upon the land which the Lord swore unto your fathers to give them, as the days of the heaven above the earth,” in a similar manner to the verse: <b>“For as the heaven is high above the earth”</b> (Psalms 103:11). Consequently, if one writes “above the earth” at the end of the final line, it will appropriately be below the term “the heaven” at the end of the previous line. <b>And the one who says</b> that one writes it <b>at the beginning of</b> the final <b>line</b> explains the phrase “as the days of the heaven above the earth” as meaning: <b>Just as</b> the <b>heaven is far from the earth.</b> Consequently, if one writes “above the earth” at the beginning of the final line, it is far from the term “the heaven” at the end of the previous line.

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Ḥelbo said: I saw Rav Huna wrap</b> a written <i>mezuza</i> <b>from</b> the word <b><i>eḥad</i> to</b> the word <b><i>shema</i>,</b> i.e., rolling it from left to right, as the first verse written in a <i>mezuza</i> is: “Listen [<i>Shema</i>], O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one [<i>eḥad</i>]” (Deuteronomy 6:4). <b>And</b> he <b>prepared</b> the two <b>passages of</b> the <i>mezuza</i> in the <b>closed</b> manner, i.e., starting the second passage (Deuteronomy 11:13–21) on the same line that he finished writing the first passage (Deuteronomy 6:4–9).

### Part 10
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: Rabbi Meir would write</b> a <i>mezuza</i> <b>on <i>dokhsostos</i>,</b> the inner layer of animal hide, not on parchment, which is from the outer layer, and he would prepare it <b>like a column</b> of a Torah scroll, i.e., long and narrow.
