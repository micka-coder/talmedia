### Part 1
The Gemara cites another comment concerning the ruling in the mishna that a vow to bring a meal offering from barley takes effect: <b>Ze’eiri said:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> that the first portion of one’s statement is accepted <b>only where he said</b> in his vow: <b>Meal offering [<i>minḥa</i>],</b> but not in the Hebrew construct where it is attached to the term: From barley [<i>minḥat se’orim</i>]. <b>But</b> if he did <b>not say</b> the word <b>meal offering</b> independently, but either said <i>minḥat se’orim</i> or said: It is incumbent upon me to bring barley, the vow does <b>not</b> take effect, and he does not bring a meal offering.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Naḥman was sitting and reciting this <i>halakha</i></b> of Ze’eiri. <b>Rava raised an objection to Rav Naḥman</b> from the mishna: One who vows to bring a meal offering from regular <b>flour,</b> which is not used for a meal offering, <b>should bring</b> the meal offering from <b>fine flour. Is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where he did not say:</b> It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a meal offering,</b> but rather said: It is incumbent upon me to bring regular flour? Apparently, the vow takes effect even if one did not state the term meal offering in an independent form. Rav Naḥman responded: <b>No,</b> it is referring to <b>where he said:</b> It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a meal offering</b> of regular flour.

### Part 3
Rava raised another, similar objection from the continuation of the mishna: With regard to one who vows to bring a meal offering <b>without oil and frankincense,</b> his vow takes effect, and <b>he shall bring</b> it with <b>oil and frankincense. What, is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where he did not say</b> the word <b>meal offering</b> in his vow, and yet it still takes effect? Rav Naḥman responds: <b>No,</b> it is referring to a case <b>where he said:</b> It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a meal offering</b> without oil or frankincense.

### Part 4
Rava asks again based on the mishna: If one vows to bring a meal offering of <b>half a tenth</b> of an ephah, <b>he should bring a complete tenth</b> of an ephah. <b>What, is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where he did not say</b> the term <b>meal offering</b> in his vow, and yet it still takes effect? Rav Naḥman responds: <b>No,</b> it is referring to a case <b>where he said:</b> It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a meal offering</b> of half a tenth of an ephah.

### Part 5
Rava asks: <b>If</b> it is <b>so</b> that in all the cases in the mishna his vow included the term meal offering, <b>say the last clause:</b> If one vows to bring a meal offering of <b>a tenth and a half</b> of an ephah, <b>he should bring two</b> tenths. <b>Once he said</b> the term <b>meal offering, he is obligated in</b> bringing <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah of flour. Therefore, <b>when he states</b> the words: <b>Half a tenth, he is not saying anything,</b> as he did not say the term meal offering with it, and would not have to bring two tenths. In what case is the ruling in the latter clause relevant?

### Part 6
Rav Naḥman answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach the <i>halakha</i> in the case <b>where he said: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a meal offering of half a tenth and a tenth. Since he said</b> the term <b>meal offering, he is obligated in</b> bringing <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah for it. <b>When he said: Half a tenth, he is saying nothing,</b> since a meal offering is not brought with that amount of flour. <b>When he then said</b> the word <b>tenth,</b> he therefore <b>brings another tenth,</b> totaling two tenths.

### Part 7
Rava asks: <b>If so,</b> then when the mishna continues: <b>Rabbi Shimon deems</b> one <b>exempt</b> from bringing a meal offering in all these cases, <b>as he did not pledge in the manner of those who pledge, why</b> is this his opinion? Once he said the term meal offering, the vow should be valid. <b>Rava said</b> in response: <b>Rabbi Shimon stated</b> his opinion <b>according to the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, who said</b> that <b>the conclusion of a person’s statement is also accepted.</b> Therefore, even when he said the term meal offering at the beginning of the vow, since at the end he also made declarations that do not apply to a voluntary meal offering, the vow does not take effect.

### Part 8
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A person</b> may <b>pledge a meal offering of sixty tenths</b> of an ephah of fine flour, <b>and bring</b> all sixty tenths <b>in one vessel. If he says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>sixty tenths</b> of an ephah, <b>he brings it in one vessel. If he says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>sixty-one</b> tenths of an ephah, <b>he brings sixty</b> tenths <b>in one vessel and one</b> tenth <b>in another vessel, as</b> the greatest number of tenths of an ephah that <b>the community brings</b> as meal offerings in one day is <b>on the first festival day of <i>Sukkot</i> when</b> it <b>occurs on Shabbat,</b> when <b>sixty-one</b> tenths of an ephah of fine flour are brought.

### Part 9
It <b>is sufficient for an individual that</b> the maximum amount he can bring at once is <b>one</b> tenth of an ephah <b>less than</b> that of <b>the community.</b> When the first day of <i>Sukkot</i> occurs on Shabbat, thirteen bulls, two goats, and fourteen lambs are sacrificed as the additional offerings of <i>Sukkot</i>, two lambs are sacrificed as the daily offerings, and two lambs are sacrificed as the additional offering of Shabbat. Three tenths of an ephah are brought for each bull, two tenths for each goat, and a tenth for each lamb. Altogether, that is sixty-one tenths of an ephah.

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> What is the relevance of the tenths of an ephah sacrificed on <i>Sukkot</i> that occurs on Shabbat? <b>Aren’t these</b> meal offerings <b>for bulls and those for lambs, and they are not mixed with each other</b> (see 89a)? <b>Rather,</b> the reason that one may not bring more than sixty tenths of an ephah in one vessel is because <b>up to sixty</b> tenths of fine flour can <b>be mixed</b> with one <i>log</i> of oil.

### Part 11
The Rabbis <b>said to him:</b> Is it so that <b>sixty</b> tenths of flour <b>can be mixed</b> with a <i>log</i> of oil, <b>but sixty-one</b> tenths <b>cannot be mixed?</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>said to them: All the measures of the Sages</b> are <b>so:</b> For example, <b>in</b> a ritual bath containing <b>forty <i>se’a</i></b> of water, <b>one immerses</b> for purification, <b>and in</b> a ritual bath with <b>forty <i>se’a</i> less</b> the small measure of <b>a <i>kortov</i>, one cannot immerse in it</b> for purification.

### Part 12
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Sages <b>asked a question above,</b> i.e., in front of, <b>Rabbi Yehuda bar Elai: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> one <b>who says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring a meal offering of <b>sixty-one</b> tenths, <b>brings sixty</b> tenths <b>in one vessel and one</b> tenth <b>in another vessel?</b>

### Part 13
<b>Rabbi Yehuda bar Elai, the first speaker on every occasion, began</b> his speech <b>and said: Since we find</b> that the greatest number of tenths of an ephah that <b>the community brings</b> in one day is <b>on the first festival day of <i>Sukkot</i> when</b> it <b>occurs on Shabbat,</b> when <b>sixty-one</b> tenths of fine flour are brought, it <b>is</b> therefore <b>sufficient for an individual that</b> the maximum amount he can bring at once is <b>one</b> tenth of an ephah <b>less than</b> that of <b>the community.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Rabbi Shimon said to him: Aren’t these</b> meal offerings brought with <b>bulls and those</b> brought with <b>lambs?</b> Don’t <b>these,</b> the meal offerings brought with the bulls, have <b>a thick mixture,</b> as six <i>log</i> of oil are mixed with three tenths of an ephah of flour, <b>and those,</b> the meal offerings brought with the lambs, have <b>a thin mixture,</b> as three <i>log</i> of oil are mixed with a tenth of an ephah of flour? Isn’t <b>the mixture</b> of <b>these</b> meal offerings, the daily offering and the additional offerings, performed <b>in the morning, and the mixture</b> of <b>those</b> meal offerings, brought with the afternoon daily offering, performed in the <b>afternoon,</b> and isn’t it the case that <b>they are not mixed with one another?</b> The communal offerings cannot serve as precedent because they never bring sixty-one tenths in one vessel.

### Part 15
The Sages <b>said to him: You</b> should <b>state</b> a reason why a meal offering of more than sixty tenths of an ephah must be brought in more than one vessel. Rabbi Shimon <b>said to them: It says</b> in the Torah: <b>“And every meal offering, mixed with oil, or dry,</b> shall all the sons of Aaron have, one as well as another” (Leviticus 7:10). <b>The Torah has already stated</b> here: <b>Bring a meal offering that is capable of being mixed.</b>

### Part 16
Rabbi Yehuda <b>said to him:</b> Is it so that if the mixture consists <b>of sixty</b> tenths of flour, it can <b>be mixed</b> with a <i>log</i> of oil, <b>and</b> if it consists <b>of sixty-one</b> tenths, it <b>cannot be mixed?</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda: <b>All the measures of the Sages are so: In</b> a ritual bath containing <b>forty <i>se’a</i></b> of water, <b>one immerses</b> for purification, and <b>in</b> a ritual bath with <b>forty <i>se’a</i> less</b> the small measure of <b>a <i>kortov</i>, one cannot immerse</b> and be purified.

### Part 17
Similarly, food in the volume of <b>an egg-bulk transmits the ritual impurity of food,</b> while food in the volume of <b>an egg-bulk less</b> a small amount equal to the volume of <b>a sesame</b> seed <b>does not transmit impurity of food.</b> Similarly, a garment that is <b>three by three</b> handbreadths <b>is susceptible to ritual impurity</b> imparted by <b>treading</b> if a man who experiences a gonorrhea-like discharge [<i>zav</i>] sits or lies on it, while if it is <b>three by three</b> handbreadths <b>less one thread,</b> a tiny measurement, it <b>is not susceptible to ritual impurity</b> imparted by <b>treading.</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara asks: Even <b>if</b> sixty tenths <b>do not mix</b> with one <i>log</i> of oil, <b>what of it? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna that although there is a mitzva to mix the oil with the flour in a meal offering, <b>if he did not mix</b> them, it is still <b>valid?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>Rabbi Zeira says:</b> For <b>any</b> measure of flour <b>that</b> is <b>suitable for mixing</b> with oil in a meal offering, the lack of <b>mixing does not invalidate</b> the meal offering. Although there is a mitzva to mix the oil and the flour <i>ab initio</i>, the meal offering is fit for sacrifice even if the oil and the flour are not mixed. <b>And</b> for <b>any</b> measure of flour <b>that</b> is <b>not suitable for mixing</b> with oil in a meal offering, the lack of <b>mixing invalidates</b> the meal offering.

### Part 19
The Gemara relates an incident involving halakhic measurements: <b>Rabbi Beivai says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says:</b> There was <b>an incident involving a mule</b> belonging <b>to the house of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>that died, and the Sages estimated</b> the amount of <b>its blood</b> that emerged <b>as a quarter-</b><i>log</i>, which is the minimum measurement for it to impart ritual impurity.

### Part 20
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Bisna raises an objection: Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Beteira testified</b> that they had a tradition <b>concerning the blood of</b> unslaughtered animal <b>carcasses that it is ritually pure.</b> Similarly, <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Beteira said: An incident</b> occurred where people <b>were killing wild donkeys</b> in order to feed the meat <b>to the lions</b> that were <b>in the king’s stadium [<i>be’istarya</i>], and</b> those <b>ascending to Jerusalem on the pilgrimage festival were wading up to their knees [<i>rekhuboteihen</i>] in</b> the donkeys’ <b>blood, and</b> the Sages <b>did not say anything to them</b> about them becoming impure. Apparently, the blood of an animal carcass does not transmit ritual impurity, even though the carcass itself does.

### Part 21
Rabbi Beivai <b>was silent</b> and did not answer. <b>Rabbi Zerika said to him: What is the reason</b> that <b>the Master does not respond</b> to the question? Rabbi Beivai <b>said to him: How can I respond to him?</b> My circumstances can be described <b>as Rabbi Ḥanin said</b> in interpreting the verse: “And your life shall hang in doubt before you; and you shall fear night and day, and you shall have no assurance of your life” (Deuteronomy 28:66). <b>“And your life shall hang in doubt before you”; this</b> is referring to one <b>who purchases grain from one year for the next,</b> because he is not certain that he will find grain to eat in the next year.

### Part 22
<b>“And you shall fear night and day”; this</b> is referring to one <b>who purchases grain</b> from one <b>Shabbat eve to another</b> because he does not have the resources to provide for himself further. <b>“And you shall have no assurance of your life”; this</b> is referring to one <b>who relies on the baker [<i>hapalter</i>]</b> to give him bread because he has no grain of his own.
