### Part 1
the offering is <b>not accepted,</b> as the verse states with regard to the frontplate: “That it may be accepted for them before the Lord” (Exodus 28:38), with the term “for them” teaching that this applies only for Jews, not for gentiles.

### Part 2
<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from another <i>baraita</i>: <b>For what does the frontplate</b> worn by the High Priest <b>effect acceptance?</b> It effects acceptance <b>for the blood, for the flesh, and for the fat</b> of an offering <b>that became impure</b> in the Temple, <b>whether</b> they were rendered impure <b>unwittingly or intentionally, whether due to circumstances beyond one’s control or willfully, whether in</b> the case of the offering of <b>an individual or in</b> the case of <b>a communal</b> offering. In contrast to the statement of the previous <i>baraita</i>, this <i>baraita</i> teaches that the frontplate does effect acceptance in the case of an individual offering for blood that became impure and was sprinkled intentionally.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Yosef said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which teaches that the frontplate effects acceptance for impure blood of an individual offering that was sprinkled intentionally, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> whereas <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i>, which teaches that the frontplate does not effect acceptance, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not separate <i>teruma</i> from ritually impure</b> produce <b>for ritually pure</b> produce. <b>And if he separated <i>teruma</i></b> from impure produce <b>unwittingly, his <i>teruma</i> is</b> considered <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> but if he did so <b>intentionally,</b> the Sages penalize him and <b>his <i>teruma</i> is not <i>teruma</i>. Rabbi Yosei says: Whether</b> he did so <b>unwittingly or intentionally, his <i>teruma</i> is <i>teruma</i>.</b> Like the ruling found in the second <i>baraita</i>, Rabbi Yosei does not distinguish between a case where one acted unwittingly and where one acted intentionally.

### Part 4
The Gemara objects to the comparison: You can <b>say that you heard</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> holds <b>that</b> the Sages <b>do not penalize</b> him. <b>Did you hear him</b> say, as the <i>baraita</i> teaches, <b>that</b> the <b>frontplate effects acceptance for</b> the impurity of the portions of offerings that are to be <b>eaten? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: The frontplate effects acceptance for</b> the impurity of the portions of offerings that are to be <b>eaten,</b> and <b>Rabbi Yosei says: The frontplate does not effect acceptance for</b> the impurity of portions of offerings that are to be <b>eaten?</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: <b>Reverse</b> the opinions, so that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: The frontplate does not effect acceptance for</b> the impurity of the portions of offerings that are to be <b>eaten,</b> and <b>Rabbi Yosei says: The frontplate does effect acceptance for</b> the impurity of portions of offerings that are to be <b>eaten.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rav Sheshet objects to this: And are you able to reverse</b> the opinions and say that according to Rabbi Eliezer the frontplate does not effect acceptance for the impurity of portions that are to be eaten? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that</b> one who partakes of <b>impure sacrificial meat,</b> i.e., one who partakes of the meat while in a state of ritual impurity, <b>before the sprinkling of the blood</b> takes place, is <b>liable for</b> eating <b>it due to</b> violation of the prohibition against partaking of the meat while <b>ritually impure.</b>

### Part 7
To counter this, <b>the verse states: “Every one that is ritually pure may eat of it”</b> (Leviticus 7:19), and immediately afterward the verse states: <b>“But the soul that eats of the meat of the sacrifice of peace offerings, that belong to the Lord, having his impurity upon him,</b> that soul <b>shall be cut off</b> from his people” (Leviticus 7:20). The juxtaposition of these verses teaches that if one who is impure partakes of <b>that which has become permitted to those who are ritually pure,</b> he is <b>liable for</b> eating <b>it due to</b> violation of the prohibition against partaking of the meat while <b>ritually impure.</b>

### Part 8
<b>But</b> if one who is impure partakes of <b>that which is not permitted to those who are pure,</b> he is <b>not liable for</b> eating <b>it due to</b> violation of the prohibition against partaking of the meat while <b>ritually impure.</b> Since it is not permitted to eat the sacrificial meat before the sprinkling of the blood, one who partakes of it at that point is not liable to receive <i>karet</i> for eating it while ritually impure.

### Part 9
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Or</b> perhaps, <b>is</b> the verse teaching <b>only</b> that if one who is impure partakes of that which <b>is eaten by those who are ritually pure,</b> he is <b>liable for</b> eating <b>it due to</b> violation of the prohibition against partaking of the meat while <b>ritually impure; but</b> in a case <b>where</b> he partakes of <b>that which is not eaten by those who are ritually pure,</b> he is <b>not liable for</b> eating <b>it due to</b> violation of the prohibition against partaking of the meat while <b>ritually impure</b> despite the fact that its blood has already been sprinkled? <b>I would</b> then <b>exclude</b> sacrificial meat <b>that</b> was <b>left overnight and</b> meat <b>that leaves</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>which are not</b> permitted to be <b>eaten by those who are ritually pure,</b> and I would derive that one who is impure who partakes of them is not liable for eating them.

### Part 10
Therefore, <b>the verse states: “That belong to the Lord,”</b> which teaches that the verse <b>included</b> leftover meat and meat that leaves the Temple courtyard in the prohibition, and one who partakes of them while impure is liable for partaking of them.

### Part 11
One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I include</b> in the prohibition <b>the</b> meat that was rendered <b><i>piggul</i></b> through one’s intention of consuming it after its designated time <b>and the</b> meat that was rendered <b><i>notar</i>.</b>

### Part 12
The <i>baraita</i> interjects: <b>Isn’t <i>notar</i></b> identical to meat that was <b>left overnight,</b> and it has already been established that one is liable for partaking of leftover meat while in an impure state? <b>Rather,</b> what is meant is as follows: One might have thought to include in the prohibition <b>even the</b> meats that were rendered <b><i>piggul</i>,</b> just <b>as <i>notar</i></b> is included. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Of the meat of the sacrifice of peace offerings,”</b> and the term “of the meat” <b>excluded</b> one who is impure who partakes of <i>piggul</i>.

### Part 13
The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>And what did you see to include these,</b> i.e., leftover meat and meat that leaves the courtyard, <b>and to exclude those,</b> i.e., <i>piggul</i>? It answers: <b>After the verse included</b> some offerings <b>and excluded</b> others, <b>you</b> should <b>say</b> the following: <b>I include these,</b> the leftover meat and the meat that leaves the Temple courtyard, <b>as they had a period of fitness</b> after their blood was sprinkled, before they were rendered unfit by being left over or by leaving the Temple courtyard. <b>And I exclude those,</b> <i>piggul</i>, <b>as they never had a period of fitness,</b> as they were already unfit when the blood was sprinkled.

### Part 14
The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>And if you say</b> that if that is the case, then with regard to sacrificial <b>meat that became impure before the sprinkling of the blood, and</b> one who was impure <b>ate it after the sprinkling of the blood, for what</b> reason is he <b>liable for</b> eating <b>it due to</b> violation of the prohibition against partaking of the meat while <b>ritually impure</b> if it never had a period of fitness? The answer is that he is liable <b>because the frontplate effects acceptance</b> and the sprinkling is valid.

### Part 15
It arises from this <i>baraita</i> that if the offering <b>became impure,</b> then <b>yes,</b> the frontplate effects acceptance; but in the case of sacrificial meat that <b>leaves</b> the Temple courtyard, the frontplate <b>does not</b> effect acceptance, and therefore it was never considered to have a period of fitness.

### Part 16
Rav Sheshet now states his question: <b>Who did you hear who says</b> that the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood is <b>not effective</b> in the case of sacrificial meat that <b>leaves</b> the Temple courtyard? This is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> as seen in tractate <i>Me’ila</i> (6b), <b>and</b> yet although this <i>baraita</i> is then clearly in accordance with his opinion, it <b>teaches that</b> the <b>frontplate effects acceptance for</b> the impurity of the portions of offerings that are to be <b>eaten.</b> Therefore, this too is the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, and the opinions in the <i>baraita</i> cited above should not be reversed.

### Part 17
<b>Rather, Rav Ḥisda said:</b> It is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which teaches that the frontplate effects acceptance for the impurity of the portions of offerings that are to be eaten, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> whereas <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i>, which teaches that the frontplate does not effect acceptance, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara asks: You can <b>say that you heard</b> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> holds <b>that</b> the <b>frontplate effects acceptance for</b> the impurity of the portions of offerings that are to be <b>eaten,</b> but <b>did you hear him</b> say <b>that</b> the Sages <b>did not penalize</b> one who acted willfully? The Gemara answers: <b>Yes. Just as you heard</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> holds with regard to <i>teruma</i> that one who separated impure produce on behalf of pure produce is not penalized, <b>you heard</b> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> holds the same. This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Whether</b> one acted <b>unwittingly or intentionally, his <i>teruma</i> is <i>teruma</i>.</b>

### Part 19
The Gemara objects: You can <b>say that you heard Rabbi Eliezer</b> state this <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to <i>teruma</i>, which</b> is <b>lenient,</b> but <b>did you hear him</b> say this <b>with regard to consecrated</b> items, <b>which</b> are more <b>severe?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> it is <b>so</b> that Rabbi Eliezer does not hold the same opinion with regard to consecrated items, <b>to whom will you attribute this</b> <i>baraita</i> that rules that the Sages did not penalize one who acted willfully? Rather, it must be that this is the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer.

### Part 20
<b>Ravina said</b> that the contradiction between the two <i>baraitot</i> should be resolved as follows: With regard to the circumstances of the contraction of <b>its ritual impurity,</b> regardless of whether the blood was rendered impure <b>unwittingly or intentionally,</b> the frontplate effects acceptance for the impurity and the offering is <b>accepted,</b> as the second <i>baraita</i> teaches. By contrast, with regard to <b>the sprinkling of</b> the blood, if it was <b>unwittingly</b> sprinkled after becoming ritually impure, meaning that the priest was unaware that it was impure, then the offering is <b>accepted,</b> but if it was <b>intentionally</b> sprinkled after becoming impure, it is <b>not accepted,</b> as the first <i>baraita</i> teaches.

### Part 21
<b>And Rabbi Sheila said</b> the opposite resolution: With regard to <b>the sprinkling of</b> the blood, <b>whether</b> it was performed <b>unwittingly or intentionally,</b> the offering is <b>accepted.</b> By contrast, with regard to the circumstances of the contraction of <b>its ritual impurity,</b> if it was rendered impure <b>unwittingly</b> the offering is <b>accepted,</b> and if it was rendered impure <b>intentionally</b> it is <b>not accepted.</b>

### Part 22
The Gemara explains: <b>And according to Rav Sheila,</b> concerning that <b>which is taught</b> in the second <i>baraita</i>, that the frontplate effects acceptance for blood <b>that was rendered impure</b> regardless of <b>whether</b> it happened <b>unwittingly or intentionally, this</b> is what <b>it is saying:</b> If the blood <b>was rendered impure unwittingly and one sprinkled</b> its blood, <b>whether</b> it was sprinkled <b>unwittingly or intentionally,</b> it is accepted.
