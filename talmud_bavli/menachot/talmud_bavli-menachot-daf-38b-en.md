### Part 1
<b>If we say</b> that the individual <b>omitted</b> the <b>mitzva of white</b> strings <b>and fulfilled</b> only the <b>mitzva of sky-blue</b> strings, how is this possible? <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, the absence of either one <b>prevents</b> fulfillment of the mitzva <b>with the other,</b> and therefore in this case one would not fulfill any mitzva at all.

### Part 2
The Gemara answers that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> It means <b>that he omitted a mitzva but</b> nevertheless <b>performed a mitzva. And what</b> does it mean that he <b>omitted a mitzva?</b> It means <b>that he did not perform</b> the <b>mitzva in the optimal manner</b> because he did not insert the white strings first, but he did fulfill the mitzva of ritual fringes.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well</b> with regard to the mishna’s statement that absence of the <b>white</b> strings <b>does not prevent</b> fulfillment of the mitzva with <b>the sky-blue</b> strings, which has been interpreted to mean that failing to insert the white strings before the sky-blue strings does not invalidate the ritual fringes. But <b>what is</b> the meaning of the mishna’s statement <b>that</b> the absence of <b>sky-blue</b> strings <b>does not prevent</b> fulfillment of the mitzva with <b>the white</b> strings?

### Part 4
<b>Rami bar Ḥama said:</b> That statement of the mishna <b>is necessary only</b> in the case of <b>a garment that</b> consists <b>entirely</b> of <b>sky-blue wool.</b> In such a case, one is supposed to insert the sky-blue strings before the white strings.

### Part 5
The Gemara notes that this <b>was also stated</b> by <i>amora’im</i>: <b>Levi said to Shmuel: Aryokh, do not sit on your feet until you explain to me this matter:</b> When the mishna states that the absence of <b>the sky-blue</b> strings <b>does not prevent</b> fulfillment of the mitzva of ritual fringes <b>with the white</b> strings, <b>and the</b> absence of <b>white</b> strings <b>does not prevent</b> fulfillment of the mitzva <b>with the sky-blue</b> strings, <b>what</b> does <b>it</b> mean? Shmuel <b>said to</b> Levi: That statement <b>is necessary only</b> in the case of a linen <b>cloak</b> on which one places <b>ritual fringes, where</b> there is <b>a mitzva to</b> insert the <b>white</b> strings <b>first.</b>

### Part 6
<b>What is the reason</b> for this? The verse states: “And they shall put on the fringe of the corner a sky-blue thread” (Numbers 15:38). “The fringe of <b>the corner”</b> is a reference to the string that is the same <b>type</b> as the <b>corner</b> of the garment. In the case of a linen cloak, which is generally white, this is a reference to the white strings, and since the verse mentions “the fringe of the corner” before the sky-blue thread, the white strings must be inserted before the sky-blue strings. The mishna therefore teaches that <b>if</b> one inserted the <b>sky-blue</b> strings <b>before the white</b> strings, <b>we have no</b> problem <b>with it</b> after the fact, and the ritual fringes are valid.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: This <b>works out well</b> with regard to the mishna’s statement <b>that</b> absence of the <b>white</b> strings <b>does not prevent</b> fulfillment of the mitzva <b>with the sky-blue</b> strings. But <b>what is</b> the meaning of the mishna’s statement <b>that</b> the absence of <b>sky-blue</b> strings <b>does not prevent</b> fulfillment of the mitzva <b>with the white</b> strings?

### Part 8
<b>Rami bar Ḥama said to him:</b> That statement of the mishna <b>is necessary only</b> in the case of <b>a garment that</b> consists <b>entirely</b> of <b>sky-blue wool, where</b> it is <b>a mitzva to</b> insert the <b>sky-blue</b> strings <b>first, as</b> the phrase: “The fringe of <b>the corner”</b> indicates that the first strings one inserts into the garment are those that are the same <b>type</b> as the <b>corner</b> of the garment. The mishna therefore teaches that <b>if</b> one inserted the <b>white</b> strings <b>first, we have no</b> problem <b>with it</b> after the fact, and the ritual fringes are fit.

### Part 9
<b>Rava said: Is it</b> actually the <b>color</b> of the garment that <b>determines</b> the proper order in which one should insert the strings? <b>Rather, Rava said:</b> The ruling of the mishna <b>is necessary only for</b> a case of <b>severed</b> strings. The mishna teaches <b>that if</b> the <b>sky-blue</b> strings <b>were severed and</b> the <b>white</b> ones <b>remain, or if</b> the <b>white</b> strings <b>were severed and</b> the <b>sky-blue</b> strings <b>remain, we have no</b> problem <b>with it,</b> and the ritual fringes are fit.

### Part 10
<b>As the sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya say: Severed</b> white or <b>sky-blue</b> strings <b>are fit, and</b> similarly, <b>severed hyssop</b> branches <b>are fit</b> for sprinkling the water of purification mixed with the ashes of a red heifer. The Gemara asks: <b>What measure</b> do <b>severed</b> strings need to be in order to remain fit? <b>Bar Hamduri says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The strings must remain long <b>enough to tie them in a slipknot.</b>

### Part 11
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: When Shmuel says that severed strings must still be long <b>enough to tie them in a slipknot,</b> does that mean <b>to tie all of the</b> strings <b>together in a slipknot? Or perhaps</b> the strings may be even shorter, provided that they are long enough to tie <b>each one individually.</b> The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 12
<b>Rav Ashi asks:</b> If the strings are <b>thick</b> and <b>cannot be tied in a slipknot, but if they were</b> the same length but <b>thin</b> they <b>could be tied in a slipknot, what</b> is their status? <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi:</b> If the strings are long enough to be fit if they are thin, <b>all the more so</b> they are fit if they are thick, <b>as the mitzva</b> one fulfills <b>with them is</b> more <b>recognizable</b> with thicker strings.

### Part 13
The Gemara cited the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, who holds that one cannot fulfill the mitzva of ritual fringes without both white and sky-blue strings, and the Gemara explained that the mishna can be interpreted in accordance with his opinion. The Gemara now asks: <b>Who is the <i>tanna</i> who disagrees with Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi and holds that the sky-blue strings and the white strings are not interdependent? The Gemara answers: <b>It is this</b> following <b><i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says in the name of Rabbi Natan, who said in the name of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri:</b> If <b>one does not have sky-blue</b> strings, he nevertheless <b>affixes white</b> strings.

### Part 14
<b>Rava said: Learn from</b> the sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya that one is <b>required to tie</b> a knot <b>after each and every set</b> of windings, and one cannot suffice with only one knot at the end of all the windings. <b>As, if</b> it <b>enters your mind</b> to say that one is <b>not required</b> to tie a knot after each set of windings, then <b>that which the sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya say: Severed</b> white or <b>sky-blue</b> strings <b>are fit, and</b> similarly, <b>severed hyssop</b> branches <b>are fit,</b> is difficult: <b>Once the uppermost</b> knot <b>is undone,</b> all of the windings on <b>the entire</b> corner will <b>come undone,</b> as there are no other knots holding the windings in place, and in that case the garment will not have valid ritual fringes.
