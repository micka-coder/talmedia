### Part 1
the <i>baraita</i> means that ritual fringes <b>do not have a maximum measure,</b> i.e., the strings can be as long as one wants; <b>however, they do have a minimum measure,</b> and if the strings are shorter than this measure they are not fit. <b>As, if you do not say so,</b> in a case <b>similar to it,</b> where it is taught that <b>a <i>lulav</i> has no measure,</b> is it possible <b>that it also has no measure whatsoever?</b>

### Part 2
<b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Sukka</i> 29b): <b>A <i>lulav</i> that has three handbreadths</b> in length, <b>sufficient</b> to enable one <b>to wave with it,</b> is <b>fit</b> for use in fulfilling the mitzva? This indicates that if the <i>lulav</i> is less than the measure, it is not fit. <b>Rather,</b> it must be that a <i>lulav</i> <b>has no maximum measure, but it does have a minimum measure. So too,</b> ritual fringes <b>have no maximum measure, but they have a minimum measure.</b>

### Part 3
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “That they prepare for themselves <b>strings”</b> (Numbers 15:38). The term <b>strings [<i>tzitzit</i>]</b> means <b>nothing other than strings that hang down [<i>anaf</i>], and so it states</b> in the verse: <b>“I was taken by a lock [<i>betzitzit</i>] of my head”</b> (Ezekiel 8:3). <b>And Abaye says: And</b> one is <b>required to separate</b> the ritual fringes <b>like a gentile’s lock</b> of hair, part of which is braided and the rest of which is allowed to hang loose.

### Part 4
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>affixed</b> the ritual fringes <b>to</b> the tip of <b>the corner or to the border [<i>gadil</i>],</b> they are <b>fit. Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov disqualifies</b> them <b>in both</b> cases.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rav says: Ritual fringes must</b> be inserted into a hole above the corner and <b>hang down onto the corner</b> of the garment, <b>as it is stated: “On the corners of their garments”</b> (Numbers 15:38)? <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this? The Gemara answers: It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Ya’akov says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: And</b> one <b>must distance</b> the hole through which the ritual fringes are inserted into the garment the length of <b>a full thumb joint</b> from the edge of the garment.

### Part 7
The Gemara notes: <b>And it was necessary</b> to state the ruling <b>of Rav Pappa</b> (41b) that the ritual fringes must be inserted into a hole within three fingerbreadths of the edge of the garment, <b>and it was</b> also <b>necessary</b> to state the ruling <b>of Rabbi Ya’akov.</b> This is <b>because if</b> the location of the hole was taught only <b>from</b> the statement <b>of Rav Pappa, I would say</b> that his ruling that the hole must be <b>within three</b> fingerbreadths of the edge of the garment was to teach <b>that one may not distance</b> the hole from the edge of the garment by <b>more</b> than this amount, <b>but the closer</b> the hole is to the edge of the garment, <b>the better.</b> Consequently, <b>it was necessary</b> to include the statement <b>of Rabbi Ya’akov.</b>

### Part 8
<b>And if</b> the location of the hole was taught only <b>from</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Ya’akov, I would say</b> that his ruling that it must be <b>a full thumb joint</b> away from the edge of the garment was to teach <b>that one may not</b> situate the hole <b>closer</b> than that to the edge of the garment, <b>but the further</b> he places it, <b>the better.</b> Therefore, both statements were <b>necessary.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara relates that <b>Ravina and Rav Samma were sitting before Rav Ashi. Rav Samma saw that the corner of Ravina’s cloak was torn and</b> therefore the hole through which the ritual fringes were inserted was <b>less than</b> the <b>full</b> length of <b>a thumb joint</b> from the edge of the garment. Rav Samma <b>said to</b> Ravina: <b>Doesn’t the Master hold in accordance with that</b> statement <b>of Rabbi Ya’akov</b> that the hole must be at least the length of a thumb joint from the edge of the garment? Ravina <b>said to</b> Rav Samma: It <b>was stated</b> that this distance is required <b>at the time</b> when the ritual fringes are <b>made.</b> If the corner tears later, causing the hole to be closer to the edge of the garment, the ritual fringes remain fit.

### Part 10
Rav Samma <b>became embarrassed</b> because he had asked his question based on a mistaken assumption. <b>Rav Ashi said to</b> Rav Samma: <b>Do not be upset</b> that Ravina is a greater scholar than you are; <b>one of them,</b> i.e., the Sages of Eretz Yisrael, <b>is like two of us,</b> i.e., the Sages of Babylonia.

### Part 11
§ With regard to attaching ritual fringes to a garment, the Gemara relates that <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov would affix four</b> strings to the garment, <b>and he would</b> first <b>fold them</b> in half <b>and</b> then <b>insert them</b> at the point of the folds <b>into</b> the hole of <b>the garment,</b> so that on one side there were eight strings and on the other side there were four loops. He would then take the eight strings <b>and loop them</b> through the four loops and pull them tight, thereby attaching them to the garment. The Gemara explains that <b>he held</b> that <b>we require eight</b> strings when they are initially placed <b>in the garment, in order that there be twisted cord</b> and <b>“twisted cords”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:12), i.e., four doubled strings, <b>at the place,</b> i.e., the time, when he creates the <b>loose hanging string.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Rav Yirmeya of Difti would affix eight</b> strings <b>that are sixteen</b> strings after they are placed in the hole of the garment and half of each string hangs down on each side, <b>and he would not loop them</b> as Rav Aha bar Ya’akov did. <b>Mar, son of Ravina, would prepare</b> ritual fringes <b>like ours,</b> placing four strings through the hole and allowing both ends of each string to hang down, thereby forming eight.

### Part 13
§ The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Naḥman found Rav Adda bar Ahava affixing strings</b> to a garment <b>and reciting the blessing</b> that concludes: <b>To prepare ritual fringes [<i>tzitzit</i>].</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Rav Adda bar Ahava: <b>What</b> is this <b><i>tzitzi</i></b> sound that <b>I hear? This is what Rav says: Ritual fringes do not require a blessing</b> when one attaches them to the garment.

### Part 14
With regard to this statement of Rav, the Gemara relates that <b>when Rav Huna died, Rav Ḥisda went into</b> the study hall <b>to raise a contradiction</b> from one statement <b>of Rav to</b> another statement <b>of Rav,</b> as follows: <b>Did Rav</b> actually <b>say</b> that <b>ritual fringes do not require a blessing</b> when one attaches them to the garment? <b>But doesn’t Rav Yehuda say</b> that <b>Rav says: From where</b> is it derived that <b>ritual fringes</b> attached <b>by a gentile</b> are <b>unfit?</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “Speak unto the children of Israel</b> and command them <b>that they prepare for themselves strings”</b> (Numbers 15:38). The Sages derive from here that <b>the children of Israel shall prepare</b> ritual fringes, <b>but the gentiles shall not prepare</b> ritual fringes.

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>But what</b> is the <b>contradiction</b> between these two statements of Rav? <b>Rav Yosef said: Rav Ḥisda held</b> that in the case of <b>any mitzva</b> for <b>which</b> the necessary item is <b>fit</b> when produced <b>by a gentile,</b> if it is produced <b>by a Jew, he does not need to recite a blessing.</b> Conversely, <b>any mitzva</b> for <b>which</b> the necessary item is <b>unfit</b> when produced <b>by a gentile,</b> if it is produced <b>by a Jew, he needs to recite a blessing</b> when he produces the item.

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>And is</b> this an established <b>principle? But</b> what about <b>circumcision, which is valid</b> if performed <b>by a gentile, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In <b>a city in which there is no Jewish physician, and in which there is an Aramean,</b> i.e., a gentile, <b>physician and a Samaritan physician,</b> it is preferable that the <b>Aramean circumcise</b> the Jewish boys of the city <b>and</b> the <b>Samaritan not circumcise</b> them; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> It is preferable that the <b>Samaritan</b> circumcise the boys <b>and</b> the <b>Aramean not</b> circumcise them. Nevertheless, all agree that a circumcision performed by a gentile is valid.

### Part 17
<b>And</b> despite the fact that circumcision performed by a gentile is valid, when it is performed <b>by a Jew, he must recite a blessing, as the Master said: The one who circumcises</b> a child <b>says: Blessed</b> are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, <b>Who has sanctified us through His mitzvot and has commanded us concerning circumcision.</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara answers: <b>Is there reason</b> to resolve the contradiction <b>according to</b> anyone <b>but Rav? Rav</b> himself <b>invalidates</b> circumcision performed by a gentile, <b>as it was stated: From where</b> is it derived <b>that circumcision</b> performed <b>by a gentile</b> is <b>not valid? Daru bar Pappa says in the name of Rav:</b> This is derived from the verse: “And God said unto Abraham: <b>And as for you, you shall keep My covenant,</b> you, and your seed after you throughout their generations” (Genesis 17:9). The verse indicates that only the descendants of Abraham may perform circumcision.

### Part 19
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is derived from the doubled verb in the verse: <b>“Must be circumcised [<i>himmol yimmol</i>]”</b> (Genesis 17:13), which he interprets to mean: Only <b>one who is circumcised [<i>hammal</i>] may circumcise [<i>yamul</i>]</b> others.

### Part 20
The Gemara notes that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a <i>sukka</i> supports</b> the opinion of Rav Ḥisda, who holds that when an item used for a mitzva can be created by a gentile, a Jew who creates it does not recite a blessing. And the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>phylacteries is a conclusive refutation of his</b> opinion.

### Part 21
The Gemara explains: <b>A <i>sukka</i> is fit</b> even if it was built <b>by a gentile, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a booth</b> built by <b>gentiles, a booth</b> built by <b>women, a booth for domesticated animals, a booth</b> built by <b>Samaritans, a booth of any sort,</b> each is <b>fit</b> for use as a <i>sukka</i>, <b>provided that it is roofed in accordance with the <i>halakha</i>.</b>

### Part 22
<b>And</b> if a <i>sukka</i> was built <b>by a Jew, he is not required to recite a blessing</b> upon its construction, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who constructs a <i>sukka</i> for himself recites: Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, Who has given us life, sustained us, and brought us to this time.</b> When <b>he comes to sit in</b> the <i>sukka</i>, <b>he recites: Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, Who has sanctified us through His mitzvot and commanded us to reside in the <i>sukka</i>.</b> The Gemara notes that the <i>baraita</i> indicates that he recites a blessing at the time of construction, <b>whereas he does not recite a blessing</b> including the words: <b>To construct a <i>sukka</i>,</b> which confirms the opinion of Rav Ḥisda.

### Part 23
By contrast, the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>phylacteries</b> is <b>a conclusive refutation of</b> Rav Ḥisda’s opinion. <b>Phylacteries are unfit</b> when written <b>by a gentile, as it is taught</b> by <b>Rav Ḥinnana, son of Rava,</b>
