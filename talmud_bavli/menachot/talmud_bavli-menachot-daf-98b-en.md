### Part 1
The <i>baraita</i> explains: The staves of the Ark <b>pressed against the Curtain and bulged</b> outward. <b>And they appeared like two breasts of a woman</b> that are discernible through her clothes, <b>as it is stated: “My beloved is to me like a bundle of myrrh that lies between my breasts”</b> (Song of Songs 1:13). Since the staves pressed against the Curtain, they were evidently placed from east to west.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> the Ark’s <b>staves were set along the width of the Ark? Perhaps they were set along the Ark’s length,</b> in which case the Ark was placed along the length of the Temple, not along its width. <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that this cannot be the case, as the Ark was carried by two men on each side, who stood between the two staves. If the staves were placed along its length, the two men carrying it on each side would be positioned along the width of the Ark, which was one and a half cubits. This is impossible, as <b>two men</b> standing next to each other <b>in</b> the space of only <b>one and a half cubits cannot walk.</b> If the staves were placed along the width of the Ark, the two bearers on each side would be positioned between the staves along the length of the Ark, which was a larger space of two and a half cubits.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> the Ark <b>was carried by four</b> men? This is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to the carrying of the Ark by the descendants of Kohath: “And the Kohathites would travel, the bearers of the Holy Ark, that the Tabernacle might be set up before their coming” (Numbers 10:21). The verse uses the plural form twice. The first phrase: <b>“And the Kohathites would travel,”</b> indicates that <b>two</b> people bear the Ark, and the second phrase: <b>“The bearers of the Holy Ark,” also</b> indicates that <b>two</b> people bear the Ark; the total is therefore four bearers.

### Part 4
§ <b>The Sages taught: King Solomon built ten</b> additional <b>tables,</b> modeled after the one that Moses crafted, <b>as it is stated</b> in the description of the Temple constructed by Solomon: <b>“He made also ten tables, and placed them in the Sanctuary, five on the right side, and five on the left”</b> (II Chronicles 4:8).

### Part 5
<b>And if you say</b> that the terms “right” and “left” are referring to the two sides of the entrance to the Sanctuary, which was in the center of the eastern wall, this is difficult. According to this interpretation, Solomon placed <b>five</b> tables <b>to the right of the entrance,</b> on the north side, <b>and five</b> tables <b>to the left of the entrance,</b> on the south of the Sanctuary. <b>If so, we find that</b> in the case of the five tables to the left of the entrance, the <b>table</b> was placed <b>in the south</b> of the Sanctuary. <b>But the Torah said: “And you shall put the Table on the north side”</b> (Exodus 26:35).

### Part 6
<b>Rather,</b> the verse means that the Table <b>of Moses</b> was placed <b>in the middle</b> of the north section of the Sanctuary, while <b>five</b> of Solomon’s tables were placed <b>to the right of</b> Moses’ Table <b>and</b> the other <b>five</b> were placed <b>to the left of</b> Moses’ Table. All of the tables were in the north of the Sanctuary.

### Part 7
Similarly, <b>the Sages taught:</b> King <b>Solomon built ten</b> additional <b>candelabra,</b> modeled after the one that Moses crafted, <b>as it is stated: “And he made the ten candelabra of gold according to the ordinance concerning them; and he set them in the Sanctuary, five on the right, and five on the left”</b> (II Chronicles 4:7).

### Part 8
<b>And if you say</b> that the terms “right” and “left” are referring to the two sides of the entrance to the Sanctuary, this is difficult. According to this interpretation, Solomon placed <b>five</b> candelabra <b>to the right of the entrance,</b> on the north side, <b>and five</b> candelabra <b>to the left of the entrance,</b> on the south side. <b>If so, we find that</b> in the case of the five candelabra to the right of the entrance, the <b>candelabrum</b> was placed <b>in the north</b> of the Sanctuary. <b>But the Torah said:</b> “And you shall set the Table outside the Curtain, <b>and the Candelabrum opposite the Table</b> on the side of the Tabernacle toward the south, and you shall put the Table on the north side” (Exodus 26:35).

### Part 9
<b>Rather,</b> the verse means that the Candelabrum <b>of Moses</b> was placed <b>in the middle</b> of the south section of the Sanctuary, while <b>five</b> of the candelabra that Solomon crafted were placed <b>to the right</b> of the Candelabrum of Moses, <b>and five to its left,</b> all in the south of the Sanctuary.

### Part 10
§ <b>It is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i> that these tables and candelabra <b>were set inward of</b> the first <b>half of</b> the length of the structure of the <b>Temple,</b> as measured from east to west. <b>And it is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>they were set inward of</b> the first <b>third of</b> the length of the structure of the <b>Temple.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara explains that this is <b>not difficult,</b> as the two <i>baraitot</i> do not disagree with regard to the location of the tables and candelabra. In the second <i>baraita</i> the <b>Sage is reckoning</b> the length of <b>the Hall of the Holy of Holies,</b> which was twenty cubits, <b>together with</b> the length of the <b>Sanctuary,</b> which was forty cubits. Accordingly, the total length of the structure of the Temple was sixty cubits, and the tables and candelabra were set inward of the first third of its length, i.e., twenty cubits from the entrance. Conversely, in the first <i>baraita</i> the <b>Sage is not reckoning</b> the length of <b>the Hall of the Holy of Holies together with</b> the length of the <b>Sanctuary.</b> Since he is referring to the forty cubits of the Sanctuary itself, inward of the first half of the structure of the Temple’s length means twenty cubits from the entrance.

### Part 12
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: All the tables built by Solomon <b>were placed</b> from <b>east</b> to <b>west,</b> i.e., their length was along the length of the Sanctuary, as was the Table in the Tabernacle; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says:</b> They were placed from <b>north to south,</b> along the width of the Sanctuary. The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? <b>He derives</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> a comparison of the tables to the <b>Candelabrum: Just as</b> the <b>Candelabrum</b> was placed from <b>east</b> to <b>west, so too, these</b> tables were positioned from <b>east</b> to <b>west.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to the <b>Candelabrum itself, from where do we</b> derive that it was positioned from east to west? This is derived <b>from</b> the fact <b>that it is written with regard to the western lamp</b> of the Candelabrum: “Outside the Curtain of the testimony, in the Tent of Meeting, <b>Aaron shall set it in order,</b> to burn from evening to morning <b>before the Lord</b> continually” (Leviticus 24:3). The phrase “shall set it in order” is written in the singular, referring only to the western lamp.

### Part 14
The Gemara explains: One can infer <b>from the fact</b> that the verse states that the western lamp is set “before the Lord,” i.e., before the Holy of Holies, <b>that</b> the location of <b>all</b> the other lamps of the Candelabrum <b>is not</b> considered <b>“before the Lord,”</b> as they are not situated in the same proximity to the Holy of Holies. This would be the case only if the Candelabrum was positioned from east to west. <b>But if it enters your mind</b> to say that the Candelabrum was positioned from <b>north</b> to <b>south,</b> then <b>all</b> the other lamps <b>should also be</b> considered <b>“before the Lord,”</b> as all the lamps are an equal distance from the Holy of Holies.

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, what is the reason</b> for his opinion? The Gemara replies: <b>He derives</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> a comparison of the tables to the <b>Ark: Just as</b> the <b>Ark</b> was placed from <b>north</b> to <b>south, so too, these</b> tables were positioned from <b>north</b> to <b>south.</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> as for <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>let him also derive from</b> the <b>Ark</b> that the tables were positioned from north to south. The Gemara explains that according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>one derives</b> the position of the tables, which are located in the <b>outer</b> area of the Sanctuary, <b>from</b> the Candelabrum, which is also located in the <b>outer</b> area of the Sanctuary. <b>And one does not derive</b> the position of the tables, which are located in the <b>outer</b> area of the Sanctuary, <b>from</b> the Ark, which is located in the <b>inner</b> area of the Sanctuary, the Holy of Holies.

### Part 16
The Gemara challenges: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, let him derive from</b> the <b>Candelabrum</b> that the tables were positioned from east to west. The Gemara answers that Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, could have <b>said to you:</b> The <b>Candelabrum itself was</b> also <b>placed</b> from <b>north</b> to <b>south.</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written</b> with regard to the western lamp of the Candelabrum: <b>“Aaron and his sons shall set it in order,</b> to burn from evening to morning before the Lord” (Exodus 27:21), indicating that this lamp must be in greater proximity to the Holy of Holies, which is possible only if the Candelabrum is positioned from east to west? The Gemara replies that according to Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, the term “before the Lord” means that the wick of the middle lamp is turned toward the Holy of Holies, as the priest who kindles the lamps <b>turns</b> the wicks of the other lamps slightly <b>to the side,</b> whereas the wick of the middle lamp is turned directly toward the Holy of Holies.

### Part 18
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “When you light the lamps, <b>the seven lamps shall give light toward the front of the Candelabrum”</b> (Numbers 8:2). This <b>teaches that</b> the priests <b>would turn the front</b> of each lamp <b>toward</b> the <b>middle lamp,</b> but the middle lamp was turned toward the Holy of Holies. <b>Rabbi Natan says:</b> One can infer <b>from here that</b> the <b>middle</b> position is <b>preeminent.</b>

### Part 19
§ The Gemara discusses the different opinions with regard to the position of the tables: The length of each table was two cubits. When the ten tables were placed one alongside the other their overall length would amount to slightly more than twenty cubits. <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> the tables were positioned along the length of the Sanctuary from <b>east</b> to <b>west,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>this is</b> the way <b>that ten</b> tables <b>resided in</b> an area <b>twenty</b> cubits long; they could extend slightly beyond the twenty cubits, since the entire area was forty cubits long. <b>But according to the one who said</b> the tables were positioned along the width of the Sanctuary from <b>north</b> to <b>south,</b> i.e., Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, <b>how could ten</b> tables <b>reside in</b> an area that was precisely <b>twenty</b> cubits wide?

### Part 20
<b>And moreover,</b> if the ten tables occupied the entire width of the Sanctuary, <b>how would</b> the High <b>Priests</b> pass them in order to <b>enter</b> the Holy of Holies on Yom Kippur? <b>And moreover,</b> if the tables were positioned in this manner <b>we find</b> that <b>five</b> of the ten <b>tables</b> were located <b>in the south</b> of the Sanctuary, whereas the Torah states that the Table must be in the north of the Sanctuary. <b>And moreover,</b> if the ten tables built by Solomon occupied the entire width of the Sanctuary, <b>where would</b> one <b>place</b> the <b>Table</b> built <b>by Moses?</b>

### Part 21
The Gemara replies: <b>But according to your reasoning,</b> the last question applies <b>according to the one who said</b> the tables were positioned from <b>east</b> to <b>west as well: Where would</b> one <b>place</b> the <b>Table</b> built <b>by Moses?</b> If the ten tables of Solomon occupied the entire twenty cubits of the inner half of the Sanctuary, how could Moses’ Table be placed in the middle of the ten tables?

### Part 22
<b>Rather, do you maintain</b> that <b>there was</b> only <b>one row</b> of tables? It was not so; <b>they were</b> set in <b>two rows,</b> with the Table of Moses between the rows. Therefore, there was room for all the tables and it was also possible for the High Priest to pass by them.
