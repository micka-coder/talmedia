### Part 1
<b>that if</b> they <b>became bound to each other</b> and then one of them became lost, <b>that</b> the lost item <b>prevents</b> fulfillment of the mitzva with <b>the other,</b> i.e., the remaining item is unfit and must be burned. Rabbi Yoḥanan clarifies: <b>And what is</b> it that establishes <b>their bond?</b> It is the <b>slaughter</b> of the sheep. If the loaves existed at the time of the slaughter, then the loaves and sheep are sanctified as one unit. Consequently, if one of them is lost, the other is unfit and must be burned.

### Part 2
With regard to the establishment of the bond between the loaves and the sheep, <b>Ulla said</b> that the Sages <b>in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>raise a dilemma:</b> Does <b>waving</b> of the sheep and loaves before the sheep are slaughtered <b>establish a bond</b> between the sheep and the loaves, such that if one is lost the other becomes unfit, <b>or does it not establish a bond</b> between them?

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: Why is there a dilemma about this issue? <b>Resolve it from</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan, as Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>slaughter</b> of the sheep <b>establishes a bond</b> between sheep and the loaves. On can conclude <b>by inference</b> that <b>waving,</b> which precedes the slaughter, <b>does not establish a bond</b> between them.

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: It is with regard to the statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan itself</b> that Ulla <b>raises the dilemma:</b> Is it <b>obvious to Rabbi Yoḥanan that slaughter establishes a bond</b> between them <b>but waving does not establish a bond</b> between them? <b>Or perhaps it is obvious to him</b> that <b>slaughter</b> establishes a bond between them, <b>but he is uncertain</b> as to whether or not <b>waving</b> establishes a bond between them. According to the second possibility, the reason that he mentioned slaughter is that he was certain about it. The Gemara notes that the question <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Yehuda bar Ḥanina said to Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua: But when it is written: “They shall be holy to the Lord for the priest”</b> (Leviticus 23:20), it is <b>written</b> immediately <b>after</b> the verse mentions <b>waving, and</b> nevertheless Rabbi Shimon <b>ben Nannas and Rabbi Akiva disagree,</b> based on this phrase, about whether the loaves can be brought without the sheep or the sheep can be sacrificed without the loaves. This indicates that the waving does not establish a bond between these two items.

### Part 6
Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, replied to Rabbi Yehuda bar Ḥanina: <b>And according to your reasoning</b> that one can infer the <i>halakha</i> based upon the placement of the phrase: “They shall be holy to the Lord for the priest,” is this phrase referring to the time <b>after waving but not after</b> the <b>slaughter</b> of the sheep? After all, the verse speaks of giving them to the priest, which is done after the sheep have been slaughtered. How then did Rabbi Shimon ben Nannas and Rabbi Akiva disagree concerning this verse?

### Part 7
<b>Rather, what do you have to say</b> concerning this verse? It must be <b>referring</b> to a time <b>before</b> the slaughter, <b>and what</b> is meant by: <b>“They shall be holy to the Lord for the priest”?</b> It means <b>an item that is ultimately</b> given <b>to the priest. Here too,</b> one can explain that the verse is referring to a time before the waving, and it means <b>an item that is ultimately</b> given <b>to the priest.</b> The issue of whether or not waving establishes a bond between the sheep and loaves therefore remains an open question.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> is it so that <b>slaughter establishes a bond</b> between them? <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> to this from a <i>baraita</i> concerning a thanks offering, which consists of an animal offering accompanied by forty loaves. The <i>baraita</i> states: If one of <b>its</b> accompanying <b>loaves broke before he slaughtered</b> the thanks offering, <b>he should bring another loaf and slaughter</b> the thanks offering.

### Part 9
But if one of <b>its</b> accompanying <b>loaves broke once he slaughtered</b> the thanks offering, it is not possible to bring another loaf because the loaves of a thanks offering are sanctified through the slaughter of the animal, which has already taken place. Consequently, <b>the blood</b> should <b>be sprinkled</b> on the altar <b>and the meat</b> should <b>be eaten, but he has not fulfilled his vow</b> to bring a thanks offering, <b>and the loaves are</b> all <b>unfit.</b>

### Part 10
If one of its accompanying loaves broke after <b>the blood was sprinkled</b> on the altar, the loaves are not deemed unfit and the individual has fulfilled his vow to bring a thanks offering. <b>He separates</b> the four loaves for the priest <b>from the whole</b> loaves <b>for the broken</b> loaf. The priest receives whole loaves and not the broken one.

### Part 11
The <i>baraita</i> continues: If one of <b>its</b> accompanying <b>loaves left</b> the confines of the walls of Jerusalem <b>before he slaughtered</b> the thanks offering, it is not unfit because the loaves were not yet sanctified by the slaughter. Therefore, <b>he brings it</b> back <b>into</b> the city <b>and slaughters</b> the thanks offering.

### Part 12
If one of <b>its</b> accompanying <b>loaves left</b> the confines of the walls of Jerusalem <b>once he slaughtered</b> the thanks offering, the loaves are rendered unfit. Consequently, <b>the blood</b> should <b>be sprinkled</b> on the altar <b>and the meat</b> should <b>be eaten, but he has not fulfilled his vow</b> to bring a thanks offering <b>and the loaves are</b> all <b>unfit.</b> If one of the loaves left the confines of the walls of Jerusalem after <b>the blood was sprinkled</b> on the altar, the remainder of the offering is fit, and <b>he separates</b> the four loaves for the priest <b>from the</b> ones <b>that</b> remained <b>inside</b> the city <b>for the loaf that</b> went <b>outside</b> the walls of the city.

### Part 13
The <i>baraita</i> continues: If one of <b>its</b> accompanying <b>loaves became impure before he slaughtered</b> the thanks offering, <b>he brings another loaf and slaughters</b> the thanks offering. But if one of <b>its</b> accompanying <b>loaves became impure once he slaughtered</b> the thanks offering, then <b>the blood</b> should <b>be sprinkled</b> on the altar <b>and the meat</b> should <b>be eaten, and he has fulfilled his vow</b> to bring a thanks offering. This is due to the fact <b>that the frontplate effects acceptance of</b> offerings that are <b>impure.</b> Nevertheless, <b>the loaf</b> that became impure <b>is unfit,</b> as the frontplate effects acceptance of the offering but does not render impure items pure.

### Part 14
The <i>baraita</i> concludes: If one of its accompanying loaves became impure after <b>the blood was sprinkled</b> on the altar, <b>he separates</b> the four loaves that are given to the priest <b>from the</b> loaves that remained <b>pure for the impure</b> loaf.

### Part 15
The Gemara comes to its question: <b>If it enters your mind</b> to say that <b>slaughter establishes a bond</b> between the sheep and the two loaves of <i>Shavuot</i>, and similarly between the animal offering and the loaves of a thanks offering, then in the cases where a loaf became unfit after the animal was slaughtered but before the blood was sprinkled, <b>since</b> the animal and the loaves <b>bonded with each other through the slaughtering,</b> once the <b>loaf became unfit, the thanks offering should also become unfit.</b> Consequently, the blood of the offering should not be sprinkled on the altar and the meat should not be eaten, contrary to what is stated in the <i>baraita</i>.

### Part 16
The Gemara answers: The <b>thanks offering is different, as the Merciful One called it a peace offering,</b> as the verse states: “The sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving” (Leviticus 7:13). Consequently, <b>just as a peace offering is sacrificed without loaves, so too a thanks offering</b> can be <b>sacrificed without loaves.</b>

### Part 17
§ <b>Rabbi Yirmeya says: If you say</b> that <b>waving establishes a bond</b> between the loaves and the sheep, then in a case where <b>the loaves were lost</b> after the waving,
