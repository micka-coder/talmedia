### Part 1
with regard to the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest, which is <b>a meal offering that comes</b> in the amount of <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah of flour, from the meal offering that accompanies the sacrifice of sheep, which is also a meal offering that comes in the amount of a tenth of an ephah of flour, and not from a meal offering that is brought in the amount of two or three tenths of an ephah of flour.

### Part 2
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>they did not appoint another</b> High <b>Priest in his stead, from whose</b> property <b>was</b> the griddle-cake offering brought and <b>sacrificed? Rabbi Shimon says:</b> It is brought and sacrificed <b>from</b> the property <b>of the community. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> It is brought and sacrificed <b>from</b> the property <b>of the heirs</b> of the High Priest. <b>And</b> for the duration of the period until a new High Priest was appointed, the griddle-cake offering <b>was sacrificed</b> as <b>a complete</b> tenth of an ephah of fine flour.

### Part 3
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In a case where the <b>High Priest died and they did not appoint another</b> High <b>Priest in his stead, from where</b> is it derived <b>that his</b> griddle-cake <b>meal offering should be sacrificed from</b> the property <b>of the heirs</b> of the High Priest? <b>The verse states</b> in reference to the griddle-cake offering: <b>“And the anointed priest that shall be in his stead from among his sons shall offer it”</b> (Leviticus 6:15).

### Part 4
One <b>might</b> have thought that the heirs should <b>sacrifice it in halves</b> as the High Priest does. Therefore <b>the verse states “it,”</b> teaching that they should sacrifice <b>all of</b> the tenth of an ephah <b>and not half of it;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The continuation of the verse: <b>“It is a statute forever [<i>olam</i>]</b> to the Lord,” teaches that in this case of a High Priest who has died and has not yet been replaced, the offering is brought <b>from</b> the property <b>of the world [<i>olam</i>],</b> i.e., the community. The end of the verse: <b>“It shall be wholly made to smoke</b> to the Lord,” teaches <b>that</b> although it is brought by the community and not by a priest, <b>the entire</b> tenth of an ephah <b>should be sacrificed</b> and not eaten.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>And did that</b> verse: <b>“And the anointed priest</b> that shall be in his stead from among his sons shall offer it,” <b>come to</b> teach <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> that Rabbi Yehuda derived from it?

### Part 7
<b>That</b> verse <b>is needed for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer to the Lord in the day when he is anointed”</b> (Leviticus 6:13). One <b>might</b> have thought that since the verse speaks of the offering in the singular, it means that <b>Aaron and his sons should sacrifice one offering.</b> Therefore <b>the verse states: “Which they shall offer to the Lord,”</b> in plural, teaching that <b>Aaron</b> sacrifices an offering <b>by himself</b> as the High Priest, <b>and his sons</b> sacrifice offerings <b>by themselves</b> as ordinary priests. When the verse refers to <b>“his sons,” these are the ordinary priests.</b> Each priest must bring a griddle-cake offering as an offering of initiation when he begins his service.

### Part 8
<b>Do you say</b> that this is referring to the offering of initiation of <b>ordinary priests, or is it</b> referring <b>only</b> to the griddle-cake offering of the <b>High Priests? When</b> the verse <b>states</b> in the continuation of that passage: <b>“And the anointed priest that shall be in his stead from among his sons</b> shall offer it; it is a statute forever to the Lord; it shall be wholly made to smoke to the Lord” (Leviticus 6:15), the griddle-cake offering of the <b>High Priest is thereby mentioned. How do I realize</b> the meaning of the term <b>“his sons”</b> in Leviticus 6:13? <b>These are the ordinary priests,</b> and the verse is referring to their offering of initiation. Consequently, verse 15 is referring to the basic obligation of the High Priest to bring the griddle-cake offering, rather than referring to a case of a High Priest who died.

### Part 9
The Gemara answers: The verse teaches both the basic obligation of the High Priest to bring the griddle-cake offering daily and the fact that when he dies his heirs must bring the offering until a new High Priest is appointed. <b>If</b> it were <b>so</b> that the verse is teaching only that the heirs of a High Priest who died must bring the griddle-cake offering until a new High Priest is appointed, <b>let the verse</b> merely <b>write: The anointed priest that shall be in his stead, his sons shall offer. What</b> is the need to say: <b>“From among</b> his sons”? <b>Learn from</b> the fact that verse uses this term that <b>two</b> <i>halakhot</i> are derived from the verse.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>And what does Rabbi Shimon,</b> who derives the <i>halakha</i> that it should be entirely sacrificed from the phrase: “It shall be wholly made to smoke,” <b>do</b> with <b>that</b> word <b>“it,”</b> from which Rabbi Yehuda derives this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>He requires</b> it <b>to</b> teach that in the case of <b>a High Priest who died</b> after bringing the first half of his griddle-cake offering, <b>and</b> then <b>they appointed another</b> High Priest <b>in his stead,</b> the replacement High Priest <b>should neither bring half of a tenth</b> of an ephah of flour <b>from his house nor</b> sacrifice the remaining <b>half of the tenth of an ephah of the first</b> High Priest, i.e., his predecessor.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>Let him derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the expression: <b>“And half of it”</b> (Leviticus 6:13), as discussed on 50b; the word “and,” which is added by the letter <i>vav</i> at the beginning of the word, is expounded to mean that the replacement High Priest must bring a complete tenth of an ephah of fine flour. The Gemara answers: He did not derive the <i>halakha</i> from there because <b>he does not expound</b> the extra letter <b><i>vav</i></b> in that word, as he holds that its addition is not significant.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>And what does Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who holds that if the High Priest dies and a new one has not yet been appointed the griddle-cake offering is brought by the previous High Priest’s heirs, <b>do</b> with <b>that</b> phrase: <b>“It is a statute forever</b> to the Lord,” from which Rabbi Shimon derives that it is brought from communal resources? The Gemara answers: It teaches that the <b>statute</b> requiring the High Priest to sacrifice the griddle-cake offering <b>is to</b> apply <b>forever.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: According to Rabbi Yehuda, <b>why do I</b> need the phrase: <b>“It shall be wholly made to smoke”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He requires it for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the griddle-cake <b>meal offering of the High Priest</b> mentioned <b>above is</b> included <b>in</b> the mandate: <b>“It shall be wholly made to smoke”</b> (Leviticus 6:15), <b>and</b> that the voluntary <b>meal offering</b> of the <b>ordinary priest</b> mentioned <b>below is</b> included <b>in</b> the prohibition: <b>“It shall not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 6:16).

### Part 14
<b>From where</b> is it derived that one is mandated <b>to apply what is said about that</b> verse <b>to this</b> one, <b>and</b> what is said <b>about this</b> verse <b>to that</b> one? <b>The verse states</b> with regard to the griddle-cake offering: <b>“Wholly,”</b> and the verse uses the word <b>“wholly”</b> with regard to the voluntary meal offering of a priest, in order <b>to</b> teach <b>a verbal analogy: It is stated here,</b> with regard to the griddle-cake meal offering of the High Priest: <b>“Wholly”</b> (Leviticus 6:15), <b>and it is stated there,</b> with regard to the voluntary meal offering of the ordinary priest: <b>“Wholly”</b> (Leviticus 6:16).

### Part 15
<b>Just as here,</b> with regard to the griddle-cake meal offering, it is included <b>in</b> the mandate: <b>“It shall be wholly made to smoke,” so too there,</b> the voluntary meal offering of the ordinary priest is included <b>in</b> the mandate: <b>It shall be wholly made to smoke. And just as there,</b> with regard to the voluntary meal offering of the ordinary priest, the verse comes <b>to place a prohibition on its consumption, so too here,</b> with regard to the griddle-cake meal offering of the High Priest, the verse comes <b>to place a prohibition on its consumption.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Shimon hold</b> that in a case where the High Priest died and a new one has not been appointed, the requirement that the griddle offering be brought <b>from</b> the property <b>of the community is by Torah law,</b> as indicated by the fact that he derives this <i>halakha</i> from a verse?

### Part 17
<b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 7:6) that <b>Rabbi Shimon said: The court instituted seven ordinances</b> with regard to the financial aspects of offerings and consecrations; <b>and this</b> ordinance, namely, that the cost of the libations accompanying the sacrifice of a found animal is borne by the public, <b>is one of them.</b> These are the other ordinances: In the case of <b>a gentile who sent his burnt offering from a country overseas,</b> and <b>he sent with it</b> money for the purchase of the <b>libations</b> that must accompany it, the libations <b>are sacrificed at his</b> expense. <b>And if</b> the gentile did <b>not</b> cover the cost of the libations, it is a condition of the court that the libations are <b>sacrificed at the public’s</b> expense, with funds taken from the Temple treasury.

### Part 18
<b>And similarly,</b> in the case of <b>a convert who died</b> without heirs <b>and left</b> animals that he had designated as <b>offerings, if he has the libations,</b> i.e., if he also had set aside libations or money for that purpose, the libations <b>are sacrificed from his</b> estate. <b>And if</b> he did <b>not</b> do so, the libations <b>are sacrificed from public</b> funds.

### Part 19
<b>And</b> another ordinance: <b>It is a stipulation of the court</b> with regard to <b>a High Priest who died, and they did not</b> yet <b>appoint another</b> High <b>Priest in his stead, that his</b> griddle-cake <b>meal offering</b> would be <b>sacrificed from public</b> funds. Rabbi Shimon then enumerates three additional ordinances. In any case, it is clear from this mishna that Rabbi Shimon holds that this <i>halakha</i> concerning the offering of a High Priest who died is a rabbinic ordinance, rather than Torah law.

### Part 20
<b>Rabbi Abbahu said</b> in response: In fact, Rabbi Shimon holds that this <i>halakha</i> is by Torah law. But in fact, there <b>were two ordinances</b> that were enacted concerning this matter.

### Part 21
Initially, they acted in accordance with that which is prescribed <b>by Torah law,</b> and if a High Priest died and a new High Priest had not yet been appointed in his stead, his griddle-cake meal offering would be sacrificed <b>from public</b> funds. <b>Once they saw that the</b> funds in the <b>chamber</b> of the Temple treasury were being <b>depleted,</b> the Sages <b>instituted</b> an ordinance <b>that</b> the payment for the offering <b>should be collected from the</b> previous High Priest’s <b>heirs. Once they saw that</b> the heirs <b>were negligent in</b> the matter and did not bring the offering, <b>they</b> revoked the previous ordinance and <b>established it in accordance with</b> the <i>halakha</i> as it is <b>by Torah law,</b> that it is brought from public funds.

### Part 22
§ The Gemara cites the continuation of the mishna in <i>Shekalim</i> (7:7): <b>And</b> the court enacted an ordinance <b>with regard to the</b> red <b>heifer that one is not</b> liable to bring an offering <b>for misusing</b> consecrated property if he derives benefit <b>from its ashes.</b> The Gemara asks: Why does the <i>baraita</i> state that this is an ordinance of the court, when in fact <b>it is by Torah law? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to a red heifer: <b>“It is a sin offering”</b> (Numbers 19:9), which <b>teaches</b> that a red heifer is treated like a sin offering in that <b>one</b> is liable for <b>misusing it.</b> The fact that it states: <b>“It</b> is a sin offering” indicates that if one derives benefit from <b>it,</b> the animal itself, he is liable for <b>misusing</b> consecrated property,
