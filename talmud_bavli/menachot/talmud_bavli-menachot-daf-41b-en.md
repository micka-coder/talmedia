### Part 1
This is permitted <b>provided that</b> the strings <b>are not broken.</b> The Gemara asks: Should one <b>conclude from</b> this <i>baraita</i> that it is always permitted to <b>untie</b> ritual fringes <b>from</b> one <b>garment</b> in order to affix them <b>to</b> another <b>garment?</b> The Gemara rejects this inference: <b>Perhaps</b> the ruling of this <i>baraita</i> applies only <b>if</b> the first garment was <b>worn out</b> and no longer wearable.

### Part 2
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a cloak that</b> is made <b>entirely</b> of <b>sky-blue wool,</b> strings of <b>every type of color exempt it,</b> i.e., the ritual fringes that are not <i>tekhelet</i> may be any color <b>except for indigo,</b> a color that is indistinguishable from <i>tekhelet</i>. This indicates that if one attached strings dyed with indigo alongside the strings dyed with <i>tekhelet</i>, the ritual fringes are unfit.

### Part 3
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A cloak</b> is <b>exempted only by</b> strings of <b>its own type.</b> In the case of <b>a cloak that</b> is made <b>entirely</b> of <b>sky-blue wool,</b> one <b>brings sky-blue [<i>tekhelet</i>]</b> strings <b>and something else,</b> i.e., strings of a different color, <b>and attaches</b> them <b>to</b> the cloak. <b>And he may not bring</b> strings dyed with <b>indigo</b> along with the strings dyed with <i>tekhelet</i>. <b>But if he brought</b> strings dyed with indigo together with the strings dyed with <i>tekhelet</i>, the ritual fringes are <b>fit.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> This is <b>not difficult,</b> because <b>here,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that holds that the ritual fringes are fit after the fact, it is referring <b>to a cloak that has</b> only <b>four strings,</b> two of <i>tekhelet</i> and two of indigo. <b>There,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that holds that the ritual fringes are unfit after the fact, it is referring <b>to a cloak that has eight strings,</b> four of <i>tekhelet</i> and four of indigo. In this case, the Sages were concerned that one would take the four indigo strings from this garment and use them in another garment, thinking that they were <i>tekhelet</i>.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: Should <b>you conclude from</b> the fact that the Sages were concerned lest one take the indigo strings from this garment for use in another garment that in general <b>one may untie</b> ritual fringes <b>from</b> one <b>garment</b> in order <b>to</b> affix them to another <b>garment?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>Perhaps</b> their concern was <b>that if</b> one <b>did</b> transfer the strings, he might mistake indigo for <i>tekhelet</i>, but it is not permitted to transfer the strings <i>ab initio</i>.

### Part 6
<b>It was stated</b> that there is a dispute between <i>amora’im</i> with regard to this <i>halakha</i>. <b>Rav says: One may not untie</b> ritual fringes <b>from</b> one <b>garment</b> in order <b>to</b> affix them to another <b>garment. And Shmuel says: One may untie</b> them <b>from</b> one <b>garment</b> and affix them <b>to</b> another <b>garment.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara cites additional disputes between Rav and Shmuel: <b>Rav says: One may not light from</b> one Hanukkah <b>lamp to</b> another Hanukkah <b>lamp. And Shmuel says: One may light from</b> one Hanukkah <b>lamp to</b> another Hanukkah <b>lamp.</b>

### Part 8
Rabbi Shimon rules that it is permitted to drag items on Shabbat despite the possibility that one might thereby create a furrow in the ground. Creating a furrow is a labor prohibited on Shabbat, but since he does not intend to create the furrow, and it is not certain that a furrow will be created, dragging the item is permitted. <b>Rav says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon with regard to dragging</b> items on Shabbat. <b>And Shmuel says</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon with regard to dragging</b> items on Shabbat.

### Part 9
<b>Abaye said:</b> In <b>all</b> halakhic <b>matters of the Master,</b> Rabba, <b>he conducted himself in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav, except these three where he conducted himself in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel.</b> He ruled that <b>one may untie</b> ritual fringes <b>from</b> one <b>garment</b> in order to affix them <b>to</b> another <b>garment, and one may light from</b> one Hanukkah <b>lamp to</b> another Hanukkah <b>lamp, and</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon with regard to dragging</b> items on Shabbat.

### Part 10
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: A person may drag a bed, chair, or bench</b> on the ground on Shabbat, <b>provided that he does not intend to make a furrow</b> in the ground. Even if a furrow is formed inadvertently, one does not need to be concerned.

### Part 11
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Yehuda</b> would <b>give</b> his garments containing ritual fringes <b>to a laundryman</b> and was not concerned that the strings dyed with <i>tekhelet</i> might become detached and that the laundryman would replace them with strings dyed with indigo. <b>Rav Ḥanina</b> would <b>form a bundle</b> with his ritual fringes so that they would not become detached while they were being laundered. <b>Ravina</b> would tuck <b>them</b> into a pocket he formed on the garment and <b>sew</b> the cover of the pocket in order to protect the ritual fringes.

### Part 12
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How many strings does one place</b> on a garment? <b>Beit Shammai say: Four</b> strings are inserted into the hole in the garment, so that there are eight strings hanging down altogether, <b>and Beit Hillel say: Three</b> strings are inserted into the garment.

### Part 13
<b>And how much should be hanging [<i>meshulleshet</i>]</b> beyond the knots and windings? <b>Beit Shammai say: Four</b> fingerbreadths, <b>and Beit Hillel say: Three</b> fingerbreadths. <b>And</b> the <b>three</b> fingerbreadths <b>that Beit Hillel say</b> should be hanging are each <b>one-fourth of a handbreadth [<i>tefaḥ</i>] of any</b> average <b>person.</b> The Gemara notes that <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> The <b>handbreadth of the Torah</b> is <b>four</b> fingerbreadths if measured <b>by</b> the <b>thumb; six</b> fingerbreadths if measured <b>by</b> the <b>smallest</b> finger; and <b>five</b> if measured <b>by</b> the <b>third,</b> i.e., the middle, finger.

### Part 14
<b>Rav Huna says</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is: One must attach <b>four</b> strings <b>within four</b> fingerbreadths of the edge of the garment, <b>and</b> they should <b>hang</b> down <b>four</b> fingerbreadths beyond the knots and windings. <b>And Rav Yehuda says:</b> One must attach <b>three</b> strings <b>within three</b> fingerbreadths of the edge of the garment, and they should <b>hang</b> down <b>three</b> fingerbreadths beyond the knots and windings.

### Part 15
<b>Rav Pappa says</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is that one must attach <b>four</b> strings <b>within three</b> fingerbreadths of the edge of the garment, and they should <b>hang</b> down <b>four</b> fingerbreadths beyond the knots and windings.

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that</b> ritual fringes <b>have</b> a required <b>measure? And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> to this from a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “That they prepare for themselves <b>strings”</b> (Numbers 15:38). <b>Strings</b> are <b>nothing other than</b> what <b>emerges</b> from the corner of the garment, <b>and</b> the term <b>strings</b> indicates <b>only</b> that there must be strings of <b>any length. And</b> it <b>already</b> occurred that <b>the elders of Beit Shammai and the elders of Beit Hillel ascended to the attic of Yoḥanan ben Beteira, and</b> they discussed the matter and <b>said: Ritual fringes have no measure. Similarly, a <i>lulav</i> has no measure.</b>

### Part 17
<b>What,</b> does this <b>not</b> mean that ritual fringes <b>have no</b> required <b>measure at all?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b>
