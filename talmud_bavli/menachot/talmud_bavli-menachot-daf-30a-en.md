### Part 1
<b>But</b> if there are <b>extraneous</b> letters, <b>we have no</b> problem <b>with it,</b> and one may erase them. This is the first <i>halakha</i> that Rav stated, which is refuted in a <i>baraita</i>.

### Part 2
<b>The other</b> is that <b>which Rav says: One who writes a Torah scroll and comes to finish</b> writing it <b>may finish</b> writing it anywhere in the column, <b>and</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> with regard to finishing it <b>in the middle of the column.</b> The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who writes a Torah scroll</b> and <b>comes to finish</b> writing it <b>may not finish</b> writing it <b>in the middle of the column in the manner that one finishes</b> writing one of the <b>five</b> books of the Torah written as an independent scroll. <b>Rather,</b> he should <b>progressively shorten</b> the width of the lines <b>until</b> he finishes the scroll at the <b>end of the column.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>When Rav says</b> that one may finish writing even in the middle of a column, he was referring <b>to</b> one of the <b>five</b> books of the Torah.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t</b> Rav <b>say</b> his statement with regard to <b>a Torah scroll?</b> The Gemara answers: He was referring <b>to</b> one of the <b>five</b> books <b>that</b> constitute <b>a Torah scroll.</b> Rav meant that when writing a Torah scroll, one may finish writing any of the first four books in the middle of a column. The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But doesn’t Rabbi Yehoshua bar Abba say</b> that <b>Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The words: <b>“In the sight of all Israel”</b> (Deuteronomy 34:12), which conclude the Torah, may be written even <b>in the middle of the column?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> ruling that <b>was stated</b> is <b>with regard to</b> finishing the Torah scroll <b>in the middle of</b> the <b>line,</b> i.e., in the middle of the width of the column.

### Part 4
The Gemara cites another opinion: <b>The Rabbis say</b> that one may finish writing a Torah scroll <b>even in the middle of</b> the <b>line,</b> but one may finish writing it at the end of the line as well. <b>Rav Ashi says</b> that one must finish writing the Torah scroll <b>specifically in the middle of</b> the <b>line. And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that it must be ended <b>specifically in the middle of</b> the <b>line.</b>

### Part 5
§ <b>Rabbi Yehoshua bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> With regard to the last <b>eight verses of the Torah</b> (Deuteronomy 32:5–12), a single <b>individual reads them in the synagogue,</b> as that section may not be divided between two readers. The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this said? It is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b>

### Part 6
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And Moses the servant of the Lord died there”</b> (Deuteronomy 34:5). <b>Is it possible</b> that after <b>Moses died, he</b> himself <b>wrote: “And Moses died there”? Rather, Moses wrote</b> the entire Torah <b>until this</b> point, and <b>Joshua bin Nun wrote from this</b> point <b>forward;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. And some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Neḥemya</b> stated this opinion.

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Shimon said to him: Is it possible</b> that the <b>Torah scroll</b> was <b>missing a single letter? But it is written</b> that God instructed Moses: <b>“Take this Torah scroll and put it</b> by the side of the Ark of the Covenant” (Deuteronomy 31:26), indicating that the Torah was complete as is and that nothing further would be added to it.

### Part 8
Rabbi Shimon explains: <b>Rather, until this</b> point, i.e., the verse describing the death of Moses, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, dictated and Moses wrote</b> the text <b>and repeated</b> after Him. <b>From this</b> point <b>forward,</b> with regard to Moses’ death, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, dictated and Moses wrote with tears</b> without repeating the words, due to his great sorrow. <b>As it is stated there</b> with regard to Jeremiah’s dictation of the prophecy of the destruction of the Temple to Baruch ben Neriah: <b>“And Baruch said to them: He dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them with ink in the scroll”</b> (Jeremiah 36:18), but he did not repeat the words after Jeremiah.

### Part 9
The Gemara now states its inference: <b>Shall we say that</b> the ruling of Rav that the last verses of the Torah are read by only one reader is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> since according to Rabbi Shimon these verses are similar to all other verses of the Torah, as they were all written by Moses? The Gemara answers: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that Rav’s ruling was stated in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon; since they differ</b> from the rest of the Torah in one way, as Moses wrote them without repeating the words, <b>they differ</b> from the rest of the Torah in this way as well, and they may not be divided between two readers.

### Part 10
<b>And Rabbi Yehoshua bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rav says: One who purchases a Torah scroll in the marketplace is akin to one who snatches a mitzva in the marketplace,</b> as the proper manner in which to perform the mitzva of writing a Torah scroll is to write one for himself. And if he himself <b>writes</b> a Torah scroll, <b>the verse ascribes him</b> credit <b>as though he received it at Mount Sinai. Rav Sheshet says: If he emended even a single letter</b> of the Torah scroll, thereby completing it, the verse <b>ascribes him</b> credit <b>as though he had written it</b> in its entirety.

### Part 11
§ Before continuing its discussion of the <i>halakhot</i> of writing a Torah scroll, the Gemara presents <b>a mnemonic</b> for the upcoming <i>halakhot</i>: <b><i>Samekh</i>, <i>gimmel</i>, <i>lamed</i>, <i>mem</i>. The Sages taught: A person may prepare</b> for a Torah scroll <b>a sheet</b> of parchment of any size <b>from three columns and until eight columns,</b> but <b>one may not prepare</b> a sheet of parchment that has <b>less than</b> three <b>or more than</b> eight columns.

### Part 12
<b>And he may not increase</b> the number <b>of columns,</b> e.g., by writing eight columns on a narrow sheet of parchment, <b>since</b> then each column <b>has the appearance of a missive</b> due to its narrow lines. <b>And he may not decrease</b> the number <b>of columns,</b> e.g., by writing three columns on a wide sheet of parchment, <b>since</b> then the lines will be so wide that the reader’s <b>eyes</b> will <b>wander,</b> as it will be difficult to find the beginning of a line. <b>Rather,</b> the ideal width of a line is, <b>for example,</b> where one can write <b>“<i>lemishpeḥoteikhem</i>,” “<i>lemishpeḥoteikhem</i>,” “<i>lemishpeḥoteikhem</i>,”</b> for a total of <b>three times.</b>

### Part 13
If one <b>happened</b> to acquire <b>a sheet</b> of parchment that <b>has</b> space for <b>nine columns,</b> exceeding the eight-column limit, <b>he should not divide</b> it into two sheets of parchment with <b>three</b> columns <b>here and six</b> columns <b>there; rather,</b> he should divide it into two sheets of parchment with <b>four</b> columns <b>here and five</b> columns <b>there,</b> so that the two sheets will be similar in width.

### Part 14
<b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement</b> that the sheet must contain a minimum of three columns <b>said?</b> It is said with regard to sheets <b>at the beginning</b> and middle <b>of the scroll. But at the end of the scroll,</b> a sheet may consist of <b>even one verse, and even one column.</b> The Gemara asks: Can it <b>enter your mind</b> to say that a sheet may contain <b>one verse? Rather, say</b> that it may consist of even <b>one verse on one column.</b>

### Part 15
<b>The measure of</b> the <b>margin</b> of a Torah scroll is as follows: The size of the <b>lower</b> margin is <b>one handbreadth [<i>tefaḥ</i>].</b> There is a requirement for a large margin there, so that a reader not inadvertently rest his arm on the writing. The size of the <b>upper</b> margin, which is less susceptible to that occurrence, is <b>three fingerbreadths [<i>etzba’ot</i>], and</b> the space <b>between each column</b> is <b>equal to the full width of two fingerbreadths. And with regard to</b> one of <b>the five</b> books of the Torah that is written as an independent scroll, the size of the <b>lower</b> margin is <b>three fingerbreadths,</b> the size of the <b>upper</b> margin is <b>two fingerbreadths, and</b> the space <b>between each column</b> is <b>equal to the full width of a thumb-breadth [<i>gudal</i>].</b>

### Part 16
<b>And</b> the space <b>between</b> one <b>line</b> of a Torah scroll <b>and</b> the following <b>line</b> must be <b>equal to</b> the space of <b>a full line, and</b> the space <b>between</b> one <b>word and</b> the following <b>word</b> must be <b>equal to a full small letter, and</b> as for the space <b>between</b> one <b>letter and</b> the following <b>letter,</b> it is sufficient for it to be <b>equal to a full hairbreadth.</b>

### Part 17
The <i>halakhot</i> of the margins notwithstanding, <b>a person may not reduce</b> the size of <b>the writing</b> in a manner that the size of the writing is not consistent, <b>not in order to</b> ensure the correct amount of <b>space for the lower</b> margin, <b>nor in order to</b> ensure the correct amount of <b>space for the upper</b> margin, <b>nor in order to</b> ensure the correct amount of <b>space between</b> one <b>line and</b> the following <b>line, nor in order to</b> ensure the correct amount of <b>space between</b> one <b>passage and</b> the following <b>passage,</b> as this is not aesthetically pleasing.

### Part 18
If <b>one happens upon a word that comprises five letters</b> and cannot be written in its entirety within the column, <b>he may not write two</b> letters <b>within the column and three outside of the column,</b> in the margin.
