this <b>is one amplificatory expression after another,</b> one in the context of the oil and the other in the context of the frankincense. And there is a principle that <b>one amplificatory expression after another</b> serves <b>only to restrict.</b> Consequently, the placement of frankincense on any amount of a meal offering of a sinner disqualifies the meal offering.

### Part 2
<b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> there is a different version of the discussion: <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raises a dilemma:</b> If one <b>placed oil</b> of <b>any amount on top of an olive-bulk</b> of <b>a meal offering</b> of a sinner, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara clarifies: Since the Torah states with regard to oil: “He shall place no oil upon it,” whereas with regard to frankincense it states: “Neither shall he give any frankincense upon it,” <b>do we require</b> that the <b>placing</b> of the oil must be <b>like</b> the <b>giving</b> of the frankincense, which must be an olive-bulk, <b>or not?</b> No answer was found, and therefore the Gemara states that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 3
§ The mishna teaches: If one <b>placed oil on the remainder of</b> a meal offering of a sinner or a meal offering of jealousy brought by a <i>sota</i>, he does not violate a prohibition. Concerning this, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When the verse states: <b>“He shall place no oil upon it, neither shall he give</b> any frankincense upon it,” one <b>might</b> have thought that this separation into two distinct prohibitions applies only <b>where two priests</b> perform these actions, one of whom places oil on the meal offering while the other puts frankincense. Perhaps in this case each of them is separately liable to receive lashes, but if one priest put both oil and frankincense on a meal offering, one might have thought he receives only one set of lashes.

### Part 4
Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Upon it,”</b> with regard to both the oil and the frankincense, which indicates that <b>the verse is speaking of</b> the <b>meal offering itself, and</b> it is <b>not</b> referring <b>to</b> the <b>priest</b> who performs the service. Since both prohibited actions can be performed on the same meal offering, an individual who does both is liable to receive two sets of lashes.

### Part 5
Furthermore, one <b>might</b> have thought this verse means <b>one may not</b> even <b>place a vessel</b> containing oil or frankincense <b>on top of a vessel</b> that contains the meal offering, <b>and</b> that <b>if one placed</b> such a vessel on the meal offering <b>he</b> has thereby <b>disqualified</b> it. Therefore, <b>the verse states “upon it,”</b> which indicates that <b>the verse is speaking about</b> the <b>meal offering itself.</b> One may not place oil or frankincense on the meal offering itself, but it is not prohibited to place a vessel containing oil or frankincense upon a vessel that contains the meal offering.

### Part 6
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>There are</b> four categories of meal offerings: Those that <b>require bringing near,</b> a rite that requires the priests to carry the offering in their hands and bring it near the southwest corner of the altar, <b>but do not require waving;</b> those that require both <b>bringing near and waving;</b> those that require <b>waving but not bringing near;</b> and those that require <b>neither waving nor bringing near.</b>

### Part 7
The mishna elaborates: <b>And these</b> are the meal offerings that <b>require bringing near but do not require waving: The fine-flour meal offering; the</b> meal offering prepared in <b>a pan; the</b> meal offering prepared in <b>a deep pan; the</b> meal offering baked in an oven, which can be brought in the form of <b>loaves or</b> in the form of <b>wafers; the meal offering of priests; the meal offering of the anointed priest; the meal offering of gentiles; a meal offering</b> brought <b>by women; and the meal offering of a sinner.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Shimon says: The meal offering of priests and the meal offering of the anointed priest do not require bringing</b> of the meal offering <b>near</b> to the altar, <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that there is no removal of a handful in their</b> sacrifice, <b>and</b> there is a principle that with regard to <b>any</b> meal offering <b>where there is no removal of a handful in their</b> sacrifice, <b>there is</b> also <b>no bringing near.</b>

### Part 9
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Pappa stated</b> a principle with regard to all the <i>mishnayot</i> in tractate <i>Menaḥot</i>: <b>Anywhere that we learned</b> in a mishna that one brings a meal offering, <b>we learned</b> that one must bring <b>ten</b> items of the same type, either loaves or wafers. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Rav Pappa <b>teaching us?</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara explains: This statement of Rav Pappa serves <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon, who says:</b> One who takes a vow to bring a meal offering baked in an oven must bring ten items. If he wishes he may bring ten loaves or ten wafers, and if he wishes <b>he may bring half</b> of them as <b>loaves and</b> the other <b>half</b> as <b>wafers.</b> Rav Pappa <b>teaches us</b> that the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna maintains <b>that</b> one may <b>not</b> do so; all ten must be of the same type.

### Part 11
§ The mishna teaches that the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Shimon disagree about whether the meal offering of priests and the meal offering of the anointed priest require the ritual of bringing near. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? The Gemara answers: <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A verse discussing the meal offering prepared in the pan states: “And you shall bring the meal offering that is made of these to the Lord, and it shall be drawn near to the priest, and he shall bring it near to the altar” (Leviticus 2:8). <b>If</b> the verse <b>had stated</b> only: <b>And you shall bring that which is made of these to the Lord and it shall be drawn near to the priest and he shall bring it near</b> to the altar, omitting the words: The meal offering, <b>I would say: I have</b> derived <b>only that</b> the <b>handful</b> that is sacrificed on the altar <b>alone requires bringing near.</b>

### Part 12
<b>From where</b> is it derived that this <i>halakha</i> applies to the entire <b>meal offering? The verse states</b> the superfluous term: “The <b>meal offering,”</b> which indicates that one must bring the entire meal offering to the altar prior to the removal of the handful. The <i>baraita</i> further asks: <b>From where</b> is it derived that this <i>halakha</i> applies to <b>the meal offering of a sinner? The verse states: “The meal offering.”</b> The addition of the definite article serves to include the meal offering of a sinner.

### Part 13
The <i>baraita</i> raises a difficulty: Why is a verse necessary to teach that the requirement of bringing near applies to the meal offering of a sinner? <b>But</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> capable of being derived by <b>logical inference.</b> The <i>baraita</i> elaborates: The procedure of bringing a meal offering <b>is stated here,</b> in the context of the meal offering of a sinner,
