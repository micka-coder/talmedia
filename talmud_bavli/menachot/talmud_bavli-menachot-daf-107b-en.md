### Part 2
One who says: <b>It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a thanks offering and a peace offering, must bring a lamb,</b> which is the least expensive land animal sacrificed as an offering. One who says: I vowed to bring a peace offering <b>and I specified</b> that it would be <b>from the herd but I do not know what</b> animal <b>I specified, must bring a bull and a cow,</b> and <b>a male calf and a female calf.</b> One who says: I vowed to bring a burnt offering and specified that it would be <b>from the animals, but I do not know what</b> animal <b>I specified, must bring a bull and a cow, a male calf and a female calf, a ram and a ewe, a large,</b> i.e., adult, <b>male goat and a large female goat, a small,</b> i.e., young, <b>male goat and a small female goat,</b> and <b>a male lamb and a female lamb.</b>

### Part 3
One who says: <b>It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a bull</b> as a burnt offering or peace offering, <b>must bring</b> the bull, its accompanying meal offering, <b>and its libations, with</b> the total value of <b>one hundred dinars.</b> One who says: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a calf, must bring</b> the calf, its accompanying meal offering, <b>and its libations, with</b> the total value of <b>five</b> <i>sela</i>, which equal twenty dinars. One who says: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a ram, must bring</b> the ram, its accompanying meal offering, <b>and its libations, with</b> the value of <b>two</b> <i>sela</i>, which equal eight dinars. One who says: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a lamb, must bring</b> the lamb, its accompanying meal offering, <b>and its libations, with</b> the value of one <b><i>sela</i>,</b> which equals four dinars.

### Part 4
One who says: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a bull with</b> the value of <b>one hundred dinars</b> as a burnt offering or peace offering, <b>must bring</b> the bull <b>with</b> the value of <b>one hundred dinars excluding its</b> accompanying meal offering and <b>libations.</b> One who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a calf with</b> the value of <b>five</b> <i>sela</i> as a burnt offering or peace offering, <b>must bring</b> the calf <b>with</b> the value of <b>five</b> <i>sela</i> <b>excluding its</b> accompanying meal offering and <b>libations.</b> One who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a ram with</b> the value of <b>two</b> <i>sela</i> as a burnt offering or peace offering, <b>must bring</b> the ram <b>with</b> the value of <b>two</b> <i>sela</i> <b>excluding its</b> accompanying meal offering and <b>libations.</b> One who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a lamb with</b> the value of one <b><i>sela</i></b> as a burnt offering or peace offering, <b>must bring</b> the lamb <b>with</b> the value of one <b><i>sela</i> excluding its</b> accompanying meal offering and <b>libations.</b>

### Part 5
If one said: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a bull with</b> the value of <b>one hundred dinars</b> as a burnt offering or peace offering, <b>and he brought two</b> bulls <b>with</b> a combined value of <b>one hundred dinars,</b> he <b>has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. <b>And</b> that is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> if <b>this</b> bull has the value <b>of one hundred dinars less one dinar and that</b> bull has the value <b>of one hundred dinars less one dinar.</b>

### Part 6
If one said: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a black</b> bull, <b>and he brought a white</b> bull; or said: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a white</b> bull, <b>and he brought a black</b> bull; or said: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a large</b> bull, <b>and he brought a small</b> bull, in all these cases <b>he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. But if he said: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a small</b> bull, <b>and he brought a large</b> bull, <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation, as the value of a small bull is included in the value of a large bull. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: He has not fulfilled</b> his obligation, as the offering that he brought did not correspond to his vow.

### Part 7
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that if one vows to bring a burnt offering and does not specify which animal he will bring, according to the first <i>tanna</i> he must bring a lamb, and according to Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya he may bring a dove or a pigeon. The Gemara explains: <b>And they do not disagree</b> in principle. This <b>Sage</b> rules <b>in accordance with</b> the custom of <b>his locale, and</b> that <b>Sage</b> rules <b>in accordance with</b> the custom of <b>his locale.</b> In the locale of the first <i>tanna</i>, when people would say: Burnt offering, they would be referring to a land animal, whereas in the locale of Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, when people would say: Burnt offering, they would also be referring to a bird.

### Part 8
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One who says: <b>It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a burnt offering with</b> the value of one <b><i>sela</i> for the altar, must bring a lamb; as you have no</b> animal <b>that is sacrificed on the altar</b> and has the value <b>of</b> one <b><i>sela</i> but a lamb.</b> One who says: When I made my vow <b>I specified</b> that I will bring an item <b>that is sacrificed</b> on the altar and has the value <b>of</b> one <b><i>sela</i>, but I do not know what I specified, must bring</b> one <b>of every</b> animal <b>that is sacrificed on the altar</b> and has the value <b>of</b> one <b><i>sela</i>.</b> Although this condition generally indicates a lamb, since the person specified a particular animal but does not remember which, one cannot be certain that he specified a lamb.

### Part 9
§ The mishna teaches that if one says: I vowed to bring a peace offering, and <b>I specified</b> that it would be <b>from the herd, but I do not know what</b> animal <b>I specified, he must bring a bull and a calf.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why? Let him bring a bull,</b> as <b>whichever</b> way <b>you</b> look at it he has fulfilled his vow. If he vowed to bring a bull, he has done so. If he vowed to bring a calf, he has fulfilled his vow, because the value of a calf is included in the value of a bull.

### Part 10
The Gemara answers: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this? It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who said</b> that if one said: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a small</b> bull, <b>and he brought a large</b> bull, <b>he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: If one said: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a bull with</b> the value of <b>one hundred dinars, and he brought two</b> bulls <b>with</b> the combined value of <b>one hundred dinars,</b> he <b>has not fulfilled</b> his obligation, <b>and</b> that is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> if <b>this</b> bull has the value <b>of one hundred dinars less one dinar and that</b> bull has the value <b>of one hundred dinars less one dinar.</b>

### Part 12
If one said: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a black</b> bull, <b>and he brought a white</b> bull; or said: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a white</b> bull, <b>and he brought a black</b> bull; or said: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a large</b> bull, <b>and he brought a small</b> bull, in all these cases <b>he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. But if he said: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a small</b> bull, <b>and he brought a large</b> bull, <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation, as the value of a small bull is included in the value of a large bull. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: He has not fulfilled</b> his obligation, as the offering that he brought did not correspond to his vow.

### Part 13
If the first clause, which teaches that one who vowed to bring an offering from the herd must bring both a bull and a calf, is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, then it turns out that <b>the first clause and the last clause</b> are in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and the middle clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> Can that be so?

### Part 14
The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, the first clause and the last clause</b> are in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, and <b>the middle clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. And this</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying: This matter,</b> i.e., the ruling that one who vows to bring an offering from the herd must bring a bull and a calf, is not universally accepted. Rather, it <b>is</b> subject to <b>a dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and the Rabbis.</b>

### Part 15
§ <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Shekalim</i> 18b): There were <b>six</b> collection horns in the Temple <b>for</b> the collection of donations for communal <b>gift</b> offerings, i.e., burnt offerings that were sacrificed when the altar was idle. The Gemara asks: <b>To what</b> did these six horns <b>correspond?</b> The Gemara gives <b>a mnemonic</b> for the names of the five Sages who give answers to this question: <b><i>Kuf</i>, <i>mem</i>, <i>peh</i>, <i>shin</i>, <i>ayin</i>.</b>

### Part 16
<b>Ḥizkiyya says:</b> These six collection horns <b>corresponded to</b> the <b>six</b> extended <b>patrilineal families of priests</b> who served each week in the Temple. There was one collection horn for each family, <b>which the Sages installed for them so that there would be peace between one another</b> and they would not quarrel. The hides of the burnt offerings are given to the priests, and by keeping the money for the offerings sacrificed by each family separate, they would not come to quarrel over those hides.

### Part 17
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Since the</b> money for the communal <b>gift</b> offerings was <b>plentiful,</b> as much money was donated for this purpose, there was a concern that if too many coins were placed in one collection horn, only the uppermost coins would be taken and the bottom ones would deteriorate. Therefore, the Sages <b>installed many</b> collection <b>horns for them, so that</b> each horn would contain fewer coins and <b>the coins would not decay.</b>

### Part 18
<b>And Ze’eiri says:</b> The six collection horns <b>correspond to</b> the six types of animals from which burnt offerings can be brought: <b>A bull, a calf, a ram, a lamb, a small goat, and a large goat. And</b> each type of animal required its own collection horn, because the mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who says</b> that if one said: It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a small</b> bull <b>and he brought a large</b> bull, <b>he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation, as the offering that he brought did not correspond to his vow.

### Part 19
<b>And bar Padda says:</b> The six collection horns <b>correspond to</b> the six types of animals from which sin offerings and guilt offerings can be brought. If an animal designated for a guilt offering or a communal sin offering was lost, another animal was consecrated in its stead, and then the first animal was found, the value of that animal is placed into one of these collection horns, and a communal gift offering is brought with it. One was for the value of <b>the bulls</b> brought as communal sin offerings. <b>And</b> one was for the value of <b>the rams</b> brought as guilt offerings for robbery or for misuse of consecrated property,
