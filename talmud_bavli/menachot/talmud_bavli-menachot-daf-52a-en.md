but if one derives benefit <b>from its ashes, one is not</b> liable for <b>misusing</b> consecrated property. It is clear from the <i>baraita</i> that by Torah law one is not liable for misuse of consecrated property if he derives benefit from the ashes of a red heifer.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Ashi said</b> in response: In fact, this <i>halakha</i> is by Torah law, but <b>there were two ordinances</b> that were enacted concerning this matter. <b>By Torah law,</b> if one derives benefit from <b>it,</b> the animal itself, he is liable for <b>misusing</b> consecrated property, but if he derives benefit <b>from its ashes</b> he is not liable for <b>misusing</b> consecrated property. <b>Once</b> the Sages <b>saw that</b> people <b>were treating</b> the ashes of the heifer <b>disrespectfully, and making</b> salves <b>for their wounds from it, they decreed</b> that it is subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property and one may not derive benefit from it.

### Part 3
<b>Once they saw that</b> as a result of this decree people <b>were refraining from</b> sprinkling it in cases where there was <b>uncertainty</b> as to whether or not an individual was impure and required <b>sprinkling, they</b> revoked the decree and <b>established it in accordance with</b> the <i>halakha</i> as it is <b>by Torah law,</b> that one is not liable for misusing the ashes of a red heifer.

### Part 4
§ The Gemara cites a dispute between Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Yehuda that is similar to the one cited earlier. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If there is a need to sacrifice the <b>bull for an unwitting communal sin,</b> brought if the Sanhedrin issues an erroneous halakhic ruling concerning a prohibition for which one is liable to receive <i>karet</i> and the majority of the community acts upon it, <b>or the goats</b> brought if the Sanhedrin issues an erroneous ruling permitting <b>idol worship</b> and the majority of the community acts on it, <b>a new collection</b> of funds is organized <b>for them.</b> The funds are not taken from the collection of the Temple treasury chamber, unlike other communal offerings. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The funds for these sacrifices <b>come from the collection of the chamber.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara challenges: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>the opposite,</b> i.e., that the first opinion cited above is that of Rabbi Shimon and the second is that of Rabbi Yehuda? <b>Which of</b> the two <i>baraitot</i> is <b>the later</b> one and therefore the more accurate and authoritative version of their opinions?

### Part 6
<b>The Sages said</b> the following <b>before Rav Ashi: Let</b> us <b>say</b> that <b>the first</b> <i>baraita</i> cited above <b>is the later</b> one, <b>as we have heard that Rabbi Shimon is concerned about</b> the possibility of <b>negligence.</b> Just as Rabbi Shimon was concerned above that the heirs of the High Priest would not provide the funds for the griddle-cake offering, it is reasonable to assume that he would be concerned that people would not contribute to a new collection, and therefore the funds are taken from the collection of the chamber.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Ashi said to</b> the Sages: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that <b>the latter</b> <i>baraita</i> cited above <b>is the later</b> and more authoritative one. <b>When Rabbi Shimon</b> expressed that he <b>is concerned about</b> the possibility of people acting with <b>negligence,</b> that was only with regard to <b>a matter that does not provide them with atonement,</b> e.g., the griddle-cake offering of the deceased High Priest. But <b>Rabbi Shimon is not concerned about</b> the possibility of <b>negligence with regard to a matter that does provide them with atonement,</b> e.g., these sin offerings.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks, in light of the fact that the discussion above was inconclusive: <b>What</b> conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about it;</b> which <i>baraita</i> is later and more authoritative?

### Part 9
<b>Rabba Zuti said to Rav Ashi: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse concerning the daily sacrifice: “Command the children of Israel, and say to them: <b>My food that is presented to Me for offerings made by fire, of a pleasing aroma to Me, you shall observe to sacrifice to Me in its due season”</b> (Numbers 28:2), serves <b>to include</b> the <b>bull for an unwitting communal sin and the goats of idol worship.</b> This teaches <b>that</b> the funds for these offerings <b>come from the collection of the chamber;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Shimon.</b> This proves that it is Rabbi Shimon who holds that these sacrifices are brought from the collection of the chamber.

### Part 10
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> for the duration of the period until a new High Priest is appointed, the griddle-cake offering <b>was sacrificed</b> as <b>a complete</b> tenth of an ephah of fine flour. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raises a dilemma:</b> Does the mishna mean that <b>a complete</b> tenth of an ephah is offered in the <b>morning and</b> another <b>complete</b> tenth of an ephah is offered <b>in the afternoon,</b> because this offering is sacrificed twice a day and is not divided in half when it is not brought by the High Priest himself? <b>Or</b> does it <b>perhaps</b> mean that <b>a complete</b> tenth of an ephah is sacrificed in the <b>morning and</b> the offering is <b>canceled in the afternoon?</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rava said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the resolution to this dilemma from that which is taught in a mishna (<i>Tamid</i> 31b) describing the order of the nine priests who brought the limbs of the daily offering up to the ramp of the altar, both in the morning and in the afternoon: The <b>eighth</b> priest carries <b>the griddle-cake</b> offering of the High Priest. <b>And if it were so that</b> the offering is <b>canceled in the afternoon,</b> then <b>sometimes</b> one would <b>not find the eighth</b> priest carrying <b>the griddle-cake</b> offering. <b>What are the circumstances</b> when there would be no eighth priest? In a case <b>where the High Priest died</b> after he brought his griddle-cake offering in the morning <b>and they did not</b> yet <b>appoint another</b> High Priest <b>in his stead.</b> Therefore, it must be that a complete tenth of an ephah was also brought for the afternoon offering.

### Part 12
<b>The Sages stated</b> this proof <b>before Rabbi Yirmeya.</b> Rabbi Yirmeya rejected it and <b>said:</b> Those <b>foolish Babylonians, because they dwell in</b> a low-lying and therefore <b>dark land, they state <i>halakhot</i> that are dark,</b> i.e., erroneous.

### Part 13
<b>Rather,</b> with regard to <b>that</b> which the same mishna <b>teaches:</b> The <b>seventh</b> priest carries <b>the fine flour</b> for the meal offering component of the daily offering and <b>the ninth</b> priest carries <b>the wine</b> for the libations that accompany the daily offering, is it <b>also</b> the case <b>that they are never canceled?</b>

### Part 14
That is not correct, as it is derived from the verse <b>“Their meal offering and their libations”</b> (Numbers 29:18) that these items may be sacrificed even <b>at night,</b> despite the fact that the daily offering they accompany must be sacrificed during the day. Similarly, the phrase <b>“their meal offering and their libations”</b> indicates that these items may be sacrificed even <b>the next day</b> (see 44b). Under those circumstances there would not have been fine flour and wine brought by the seventh and nine priests at the time of the daily offering.

### Part 15
<b>Rather,</b> one must explain that the <i>tanna</i> <b>does not teach</b> cases of <b>what if,</b> and is speaking only about the typical case. <b>So too</b> with regard to Rava’s proof from the mishna, it is not compelling because the <i>tanna</i> <b>does not teach</b> cases of <b>what if</b> the High Priest dies and a successor has not yet been appointed.

### Part 16
The Sages then <b>brought</b> Rabbi Yirmeya’s analysis <b>before Rava.</b> Rava initially <b>said</b> to them: <b>You state our inferior</b> statements, which can be refuted, <b>before</b> the Sages of Eretz Yisrael, but <b>you do not state our superior</b> statements <b>before them?</b>

### Part 17
<b>And Rava then said</b> to them: <b>This</b> statement, that the griddle-cake offering is sacrificed twice a day even if there is no High Priest, is <b>also</b> one of <b>our superior</b> statements, as <b>the verse states</b> concerning the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest: <b>“Fine flour for a meal offering perpetually [<i>tamid</i>],</b> half of it in the morning, and half of it in the evening” (Leviticus 6:13). This teaches that the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest <b>is like the meal offering</b> component of the <b>daily offerings [<i>temidin</i>]</b> and must be sacrificed in the morning and the afternoon, even if the High Priest died and was not yet replaced.

### Part 18
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> halakhic conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about</b> this matter? <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s dilemma, <b>as it is taught</b> explicitly in a <i>baraita</i>: If the High Priest died and was not yet replaced, <b>a complete</b> tenth of an ephah is sacrificed in the <b>morning and</b> another <b>complete</b> tenth of an ephah is sacrificed <b>in the afternoon.</b>

### Part 19
§ <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Abba Yosei ben Dostai and the Rabbis disagree</b> as to the amount of frankincense brought with the griddle-cake offering of the High Priest.

### Part 20
<b>Abba Yosei ben Dostai says:</b> The High Priest <b>separates two handfuls of frankincense for</b> his griddle-cake offering each day; one <b>handful</b> for his <b>morning</b> offering <b>and</b> one <b>handful</b> for his <b>afternoon</b> offering. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The High Priest <b>separates one handful</b> of frankincense each day <b>for</b> his griddle-cake offering. He divides it in half and brings <b>half a handful</b> for his <b>morning</b> offering <b>and half a handful</b> for his <b>afternoon</b> offering.

### Part 21
The Gemara clarifies: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do</b> they <b>disagree? Abba Yosei ben Dostai holds</b> that since <b>one does not find</b> a case where the Torah explicitly states that <b>half a handful is sacrificed,</b> he brings a complete handful for each offering. <b>And the Rabbis hold that</b> since <b>one does not find</b> a case where <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah <b>requires two handfuls</b> of frankincense, he brings only one handful and divides it between the two offerings.

### Part 22
Having discussed the quantity of frankincense that is generally brought with the griddle-cake offering, the Gemara now addresses a case where the High Priest died. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raises a dilemma:</b> In the case of <b>a High Priest who died and they did not</b> yet <b>appoint another in his stead,</b>
