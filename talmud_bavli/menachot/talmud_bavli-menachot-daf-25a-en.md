### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>the handful became ritually impure and</b> despite this the priest <b>sacrificed it, the frontplate</b> worn by the High Priest <b>effects acceptance</b> of the meal offering, and the remainder is eaten by the priests. If the handful <b>left</b> its designated area <b>and</b> despite this the priest then <b>sacrificed it, the frontplate does not effect acceptance.</b> The reason is <b>that the frontplate effects acceptance for</b> offerings sacrificed when <b>ritually impure and does not effect acceptance for</b> offerings <b>that leave</b> their designated areas.

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is written with regard to the frontplate: “And it shall be upon Aaron’s forehead, <b>and Aaron shall bear the sin committed with the sacred items,</b> which the children of Israel shall hallow, even all their sacred gifts; and it shall be always upon his forehead, that they may be accepted before the Lord” (Exodus 28:38). The Sages expounded: <b>But which sin does he bear? If you say</b> he atones for <b>the sin of <i>piggul</i>,</b> it <b>is already stated: “It shall not be credited</b> to him” (Leviticus 7:18). <b>If you say</b> he atones for <b>the sin of <i>notar</i>,</b> it <b>is already stated</b> in the same verse: <b>“It shall not be accepted.”</b>

### Part 3
Evidently, the High Priest wearing the frontplate <b>bears only the sin of impurity</b> in the offering of an individual. The frontplate is understood to atone for the sin of sacrificing an impure offering, <b>as its general prohibition was permitted</b> in certain circumstances, specifically <b>in</b> the case of the <b>community,</b> since in a situation where the entire community is impure it is permitted to sacrifice impure communal offerings <i>ab initio</i>.

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Zeira objects to this:</b> Why not <b>say</b> that the frontplate atones for the <b>sin</b> of sacrificing offerings that <b>leave</b> the courtyard and are thereby disqualified, <b>as its general prohibition was permitted</b> in certain circumstances, specifically <b>in</b> the case of an offering sacrificed on a private <b>altar</b> during the period after the Jewish people had entered Eretz Yisrael and before there was an established location for the Tabernacle?

### Part 5
<b>Abaye said to him: The verse states</b> with regard to the frontplate: “And it shall be always upon his forehead, <b>that they may be accepted before the Lord”</b> (Exodus 28:38), teaching that in the case of <b>a sin</b> whose general prohibition is permitted <b>before the Lord,</b> i.e., in the Temple, <b>yes,</b> the frontplate atones for it. But in the case of the <b>sin</b> of offerings <b>that leave</b> the courtyard, whose general prohibition is not permitted before the Lord, the frontplate does <b>not</b> atone for it.

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Ile’a objects to this:</b> Why not <b>say</b> that the frontplate atones for the <b>sin</b> of performing the service using one’s <b>left</b> hand instead of one’s right, <b>as its general prohibition was permitted</b> in certain circumstances, specifically <b>in</b> the case of <b>Yom Kippur,</b> when the High Priest carries the spoon bearing the incense into the Holy of Holies with his left hand?

### Part 7
<b>Abaye said to him: The verse states:</b> “And Aaron shall bear <b>the sin</b> committed with the sacred items” (Exodus 28:38), to say that the frontplate atones for <b>a sin that was</b> committed <b>with</b> the offering <b>and I deferred it.</b> This serves <b>to exclude</b> the spoon bearing the incense of <b>Yom Kippur,</b> where there is no sin that was deferred, <b>since its proper</b> performance <b>is</b> for the High Priest to hold it <b>with</b> his <b>left</b> hand, as he must hold both the coal pan and the spoon of incense.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The frontplate does not atone for the sin of sacrificing an offering with the left hand for a different reason: The verse states: “And Aaron shall bear <b>the sin committed with the sacred items [<i>hakodashim</i>],”</b> demonstrating that the frontplate atones for a sin inherent in the offering itself, <b>and not</b> for <b>a sin</b> committed by <b>those who bring the offering [<i>hamakdishin</i>].</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rav Sima, son of Rav Idi, said to Rav Ashi; and some say</b> that it was <b>Rav Sima, son of Rav Ashi,</b> who said <b>to Rav Ashi: But</b> why not <b>say</b> that the frontplate atones for <b>the sin of a blemished animal</b> that is sacrificed, <b>as its general prohibition was permitted</b> in certain circumstances, specifically <b>in</b> the case of <b>birds? As the Master says:</b> The <i>halakha</i> that an offering must be <b>unblemished and</b> the <i>halakha</i> that a burnt offering must be <b>male</b> are taught <b>with regard to animal</b> offerings, <b>but</b> there is <b>no</b> requirement that an offering must be <b>unblemished and male with regard to birds.</b>

### Part 10
Rav Ashi <b>said to him: With regard to your</b> claim, <b>the verse states</b> about blemished animals: <b>“It shall not be accepted”</b> (Leviticus 22:23), and: “But whatsoever has a blemish that you shall not bring; <b>for it shall not be acceptable for you”</b> (Leviticus 22:20), teaching that in no case are blemished animals accepted as offerings, even due to the frontplate.

### Part 11
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>blood</b> of an offering <b>that became impure and</b> a priest <b>sprinkled it</b> on the altar, if he did so <b>unwittingly,</b> the offering is <b>accepted</b> and effects atonement for the owner of the offering. If he sprinkled the blood <b>intentionally,</b> the offering is <b>not accepted. In what</b> case <b>is this statement said? In</b> the case of the offering of <b>an individual. But in</b> the case of <b>a communal</b> offering, <b>whether</b> he sprinkled the blood <b>unwittingly</b> or <b>whether</b> he did so <b>intentionally,</b> the offering is <b>accepted. And in</b> the case of an offering of <b>a gentile</b> where the blood of the offering became impure, <b>whether</b> the priest sprinkled the blood <b>unwittingly</b> or <b>whether</b> he did so <b>intentionally, whether</b> he did so <b>due to circumstances beyond his control</b> or <b>whether</b> he did so <b>willingly,</b>
