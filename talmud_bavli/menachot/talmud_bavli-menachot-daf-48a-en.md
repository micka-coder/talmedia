### Part 1
<b>and the rest</b> of the loaves <b>are</b> permitted to be <b>eaten through redemption. The Sages said</b> the following <b>before Rav Ḥisda: This</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, who holds that the slaughter of the sheep grants the loaves inherent sanctity, and in this case two of the loaves have inherent sanctity but it is not known which ones.

### Part 2
<b>As, if</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>since he says</b> that the <b>slaughter</b> of the sheep <b>consecrates</b> the loaves with inherent sanctity, when the <i>baraita</i> states <b>that he redeems</b> the loaves, <b>where</b> does he redeem them?

### Part 3
The process of redemption would be to place all four loaves in front of him and state that whichever two of the loaves do not have inherent sanctity are redeemed for money. <b>If he redeems them outside</b> of the Temple courtyard, <b>since it is written:</b> “And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the first fruits for a wave offering <b>before the Lord,</b> with the two lambs” (Leviticus 23:20), <b>he disqualifies</b> the two loaves that possess inherent sanctity <b>by</b> causing them to <b>leave</b> the courtyard, at which point they are no longer “before the Lord.” Conversely, <b>if</b> he redeems them <b>inside</b> the courtyard, once the two loaves that do not possess inherent sanctity are redeemed, he violates the prohibition against <b>bringing non-sacred</b> items <b>into the</b> Temple <b>courtyard.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rav Ḥisda said to</b> them: <b>Actually</b> the <i>baraita</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and</b> one <b>redeems</b> the loaves <b>inside</b> the courtyard. Nevertheless, it is not considered to be a violation of the prohibition against bringing non-sacred items into the courtyard because the <b>non-sacred</b> loaves <b>came</b> into the courtyard <b>by themselves,</b> i.e., they were already there when they became non-sacred and were not actively brought into the courtyard in their non-sacred state.

### Part 5
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to this very case: <b>When he redeems</b> the loaves, <b>he</b> may <b>redeem them only outside</b> of the courtyard? This contradicts Rav Ḥisda’s claim that according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi one redeems the loaves inside the courtyard.

### Part 6
Rav Ashi answered: <b>This</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is certainly</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, because if</b> it were in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, when he brings the loaves outside the courtyard <b>he thereby disqualifies them by</b> causing them to <b>leave</b> the courtyard.

### Part 7
§ <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: Let us say</b> that the <i>baraita</i>, which states that if the sheep of <i>Shavuot</i> are slaughtered with four loaves instead of two, two of the four are invested with inherent sanctity, <b>is a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan that was stated</b> with regard to <b>a thanks offering that one slaughtered</b> accompanied <b>by eighty loaves</b> rather than the required forty. In that case, <b>Ḥizkiyya says: Forty of the eighty</b> loaves <b>are consecrated, and Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Not</b> even <b>forty of</b> the <b>eighty</b> loaves <b>are consecrated.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: <b>Wasn’t it stated with regard to this</b> dispute that <b>Rabbi Zeira says: Everyone,</b> even Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>concedes</b> that in a case <b>where</b> the individual bringing the offering <b>said: Let forty of</b> the <b>eighty</b> loaves <b>be consecrated, that</b> forty <b>are consecrated? Here too,</b> one can say that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where one said: Let two of the four</b> loaves <b>be consecrated.</b>

### Part 9
§ The Gemara cites another discussion concerning the sheep and loaves of <i>Shavuot</i>. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina Tirata taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> If <b>one slaughtered four sheep</b> for <i>Shavuot</i>, rather than the required two, accompanied <b>by two loaves,</b> he <b>draws two of</b> the sheep out of the four <b>and sprinkles their blood not for the sake</b> of the sheep of <i>Shavuot</i>. He then sprinkles the blood of the other sheep for the sake of the sheep of <i>Shavuot</i>.

### Part 10
<b>As, if you do not say</b> to do <b>this,</b> but rather require him to first sprinkle the blood of two of the sheep for their own sake, then <b>you have caused the loss</b> of <b>the latter</b> two sheep. Since they were previously fit to have their blood sprinkled on the altar for the sake of the sheep of <i>Shavuot</i>, and were disqualified from this status when the blood of the other two sheep was sprinkled for that purpose, they are no longer fit to have their blood sprinkled even for the sake of a different offering.

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to</b> Rabbi Ḥanina Tirata: <b>And does</b> the court <b>say to a person: Arise and sin in order that you may gain?</b> Is it proper for the priest to sprinkle the blood of the first pair not for their own sake so that the second pair will remain fit?

### Part 12
<b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Zevaḥim</i> 77a) that <i>tanna’im</i> disagree concerning this matter? The mishna teaches: In the case of <b>the limbs of a sin offering,</b> whose flesh is eaten by priests and may not be burned on the altar, <b>that were intermingled with the limbs of a burnt offering,</b> which are burned on the altar, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The priest <b>shall place</b> all the limbs <b>above,</b> on the altar, <b>and I view the flesh</b> of the limbs <b>of the sin offering above</b> on the altar <b>as though they are</b> pieces of <b>wood</b> burned on the altar, not an offering. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> One should wait until <b>the form of</b> all the intermingled limbs <b>decays and they will</b> all <b>go out to the place of burning</b> in the Temple courtyard, where all disqualified offerings of the most sacred order are burned.

### Part 13
Rabbi Yoḥanan continued: According to your opinion, <b>why</b> do the Rabbis say that the mixture is burned? <b>Let</b> the court <b>say</b> to the priest instead: <b>Arise and sin</b> by burning all the limbs on the altar, including the limbs of the sin offering, <b>in order that you may gain</b> by performing the mitzva of sacrificing the limbs of the burnt offering.

### Part 14
Rabbi Ḥanina Tirata answered Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>We do say: Arise and sin with a sin offering in order that you may gain with regard to a sin offering,</b> since it is the same type of offering. Similarly, one may sin with regard to the sheep of <i>Shavuot</i> in order to gain with regard to the other sheep brought for the same offering. <b>We do not say: Arise and sin with a sin offering in order that you may gain with regard to a burnt offering.</b> Therefore, the Rabbis prohibit burning the limbs of the sin offering on the altar in order to allow for the burning of the limbs of the burnt offering.

### Part 15
Rabbi Yoḥanan asked Rabbi Ḥanina Tirata: <b>And does</b> the court actually <b>say:</b> Arise and sin in order that you may gain in a case where the sin and the gain are <b>with regard to one matter? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning a case of the two <b>sheep of <i>Shavuot</i> where one slaughtered them not for their</b> own <b>sake, or where he slaughtered them either before their time,</b> i.e., before <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>or after their time,</b> that <b>the blood shall be sprinkled,</b> although it shall be sprinkled for the sake of a peace offering, <b>and the meat shall be eaten.</b>

### Part 16
Rabbi Yoḥanan continued: <b>And if</b> the Festival <b>was</b> on <b>Shabbat, one may not sprinkle</b> the blood, the sacrificial portions may not be burned on the altar, and the meat may not be eaten. This is because the improper slaughter of the sheep disqualified them as communal offerings, whereas individual offerings may not be sacrificed on Shabbat. <b>But if</b> the priest nevertheless <b>sprinkled</b> the blood of these sheep on Shabbat, the offering <b>is accepted</b> in that it is permitted <b>to burn</b> its sacrificial <b>portions</b> on the altar <b>in the evening,</b> after the conclusion of Shabbat, and then the meat may be eaten.

### Part 17
Rabbi Yoḥanan concluded his proof: <b>But</b> according to your opinion, <b>why</b> is it not permitted to sprinkle the blood on Shabbat? <b>Let</b> the court <b>say: Arise</b> and <b>sin</b> by sprinkling the blood of these offerings <b>in order that you may gain</b> by being able to burn their sacrificial portions in the evening and then eat their meat.

### Part 18
Rabbi Ḥanina Tirata answered: <b>We do say: Arise and sin on Shabbat in order that you may gain on Shabbat. We do not say: Arise and sin on Shabbat in order that you may gain on a weekday.</b>

### Part 19
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is it so that <b>with regard to two</b> separate <b>matters</b> the court does <b>not say</b> that one should sin with regard to one in order to gain with regard to other? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 8:9): In the case of <b>a barrel of</b> wine that is <b><i>teruma</i> that broke in the upper</b> section of a <b>winepress, and in the lower</b> section of the winepress there is <b>non-sacred, impure</b> wine, and the wine that is <i>teruma</i> will flow into the lower press and become impure, <b>Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua</b> both <b>concede that if one is able to rescue</b> even <b>a quarter-</b><i>log</i> <b>of</b> the wine that is <i>teruma</i> in a pure vessel so that it retains its <b>ritual purity, he</b> should <b>rescue</b> it, even if, in the process, the rest of the wine that is <i>teruma</i> will mix with the non-sacred wine. This will cause the owner a financial loss, because the wine that is <i>teruma</i> will become impure, causing the entire mixture to become prohibited for consumption.

### Part 20
<b>But if not,</b> i.e., one cannot save any of the wine that is <i>teruma</i>, e.g., if one does not have any pure vessels in which to collect it, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b>
