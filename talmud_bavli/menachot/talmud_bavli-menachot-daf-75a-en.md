### Part 1
<b>Just as here,</b> with regard to the deep-pan meal offering, the <b>placement of oil in</b> an empty <b>utensil</b> is required, to which the flour is added only afterward, <b>so too there,</b> with regard to the meal offering prepared in a shallow pan, the <b>placement of oil in</b> an empty <b>utensil</b> is required. <b>And just as there,</b> with regard to the meal offering prepared in a shallow pan, <b>pouring and mixing</b> are required, as the verse states: “Mixed with oil…and pour oil upon it” (Leviticus 2:5–6), <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the deep-pan meal offering, <b>pouring and mixing</b> are required.

### Part 2
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to meal offerings that come as loaves, i.e., those prepared in a shallow pan or deep pan or those baked in an oven, it is after the flour has been baked into <b>loaves</b> that one breaks them into pieces and <b>mixes them</b> with oil; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> It is with <b>fine flour,</b> before the baking, that one mixes the oil.

### Part 3
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the meal offering prepared in a shallow pan, the verse states: “It shall be of <b>fine flour</b> unleavened, <b>mixed</b> with oil.” This <b>teaches that it is mixed</b> while still <b>flour. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> It is after the flour has been baked into <b>loaves</b> that he <b>mixes them, as it is stated:</b> “And when you bring a meal offering baked in the oven, it shall be unleavened <b>loaves</b> of fine flour <b>mixed</b> with oil” (Leviticus 2:4). The Rabbis <b>said to him: But is it not with regard to loaves of a thanks offering</b> that <b>it is stated:</b> “Unleavened <b>loaves</b> mixed with oil…and loaves mixed with oil, of fine flour soaked” (Leviticus 7:12), <b>and it is not possible to mix them when they are loaves,</b> but <b>only</b> when they are <b>fine flour?</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara explains the procedure of mixing the oven-baked meal offerings according to the Rabbis. <b>How does</b> the priest <b>perform</b> the rite? He <b>places oil in a utensil before</b> the placement of the flour <b>is done, and</b> then he <b>places</b> the flour into the utensil. <b>And he</b> then <b>places oil upon it and mixes it, and kneads it</b> in lukewarm water, <b>and bakes it</b> in a shallow pan or a deep pan, in accordance with his vow. <b>And</b> then <b>he breaks it</b> into pieces, <b>and he</b> again <b>places oil upon</b> the pieces, which constitutes the required pouring, <b>and</b> he <b>removes a handful</b> for the altar.

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> After the meal offerings have been baked into <b>loaves,</b> one breaks them into pieces and <b>mixes them</b> with oil, <b>as it is stated: “Loaves</b> of fine flour <b>mixed with oil.” How does</b> the priest <b>perform</b> the rite? He <b>places oil in a utensil before</b> the placement of the flour <b>is done, and</b> then he <b>places</b> the flour into the utensil. <b>And</b> then <b>he kneads it</b> in lukewarm water, <b>and bakes it</b> in a shallow pan or deep pan, <b>and breaks</b> the loaves into pieces, <b>and places oil upon the</b> pieces <b>and mixes</b> them, <b>and again places oil upon</b> the pieces, which constitutes the pouring of the oil, <b>and removes a handful</b> to be burned on the altar.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: With regard to the difficulty that <b>it is not possible</b> to mix them when they are loaves, <b>which the Rabbis said to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>what</b> is <b>it</b> that makes it impossible? The Gemara answers that <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak says:</b> Since only <b>a quarter-</b><i>log</i> <b>of oil is</b> used, <b>how could it be divided among a number of loaves?</b> As this is not sufficient oil to mix with baked offerings, it must be that the oil is mixed with the unbaked flour.

### Part 7
§ The mishna teaches: <b>The loaves</b> of the meal offering baked in an oven <b>require mixing</b> of their flour with oil, <b>and wafers</b> require only <b>smearing. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse specifies with regard to the oven-baked meal offering: “And when you bring a meal offering baked in the oven, it shall be unleavened <b>loaves</b> of fine flour <b>mixed</b> with oil” (Leviticus 2:4). This indicates that only the loaves are mixed, <b>but the wafers are not mixed.</b> This derivation is necessary, as one <b>might</b> have thought: Could the opposite conclusion <b>not</b> be derived through <b>logical inference? And if loaves, which do not require smearing,</b> do <b>require mixing,</b> then <b>is it not logical</b> that <b>wafers, which require smearing,</b> also <b>require mixing?</b> To counter this inference, <b>the verse states: “Loaves</b> of fine flour <b>mixed,” but wafers are not mixed.</b>

### Part 8
With regard to wafers, the same verse teaches that <b>wafers are smeared</b> with oil, <b>but loaves are not smeared.</b> This derivation is necessary, <b>as</b> one <b>might</b> have thought: Could the opposite conclusion <b>not</b> be derived through <b>logical inference,</b> namely: <b>And if wafers, which do not require mixing,</b> do <b>require smearing,</b> then <b>is it not logical</b> that <b>loaves, which require mixing,</b> also <b>require smearing?</b> To counter this inference, <b>the verse states</b> that <b>wafers are smeared</b> with oil, <b>but loaves are not smeared.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the</b> biblical <b>derivation?</b> Why are the terms “mixed” and “smeared” not interpreted to be referring to both varieties of oven-baked meal offerings? The Gemara answers: <b>Rava said:</b> If this were the intention, then the Torah <b>should not omit</b> this description completely, <b>and let it write</b> in some other verse: <b>Smeared loaves and mixed wafers.</b> The fact that the Torah never describes the loaves as smeared and wafers as mixed indicates that loaves are not smeared and wafers are not mixed.

### Part 10
§ The mishna teaches: <b>How does one smear</b> oil on <b>them?</b> He does so in a shape <b>similar</b> to <b>chi, and the rest</b> of the oil <b>is eaten</b> by priests. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>Similar</b> to <b>chi? Rav Kahana said:</b> It is smeared in a shape <b>similar</b> to the <b>Greek</b> letter <b>chi,</b> Χ.

### Part 11
§ Concerning the mixing of oil into the loaves and the smearing of oil upon the wafers, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: An oven-baked <b>meal offering that comes as half loaves and half wafers,</b> i.e., five of each, may be brought according to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, who does not require ten items of a uniform type. How is the oil applied to this offering? According to one opinion, he <b>brings a <i>log</i> of oil,</b> which is the requisite quantity to accompany a tenth of an ephah of flour, <b>and divides it into two</b> parts. <b>Half of</b> the oil is used <b>for</b> the <b>loaves, and half of</b> the oil is used <b>for</b> the <b>wafers.</b>

### Part 12
As for <b>the loaves,</b> he <b>mixes them</b> with the oil, <b>and</b> as for <b>the wafers,</b> he <b>smears</b> them. <b>And</b> he <b>smears</b> the oil on <b>the wafer over the entire surface,</b> not in the shape of the letter chi, <b>and he returns the rest of the oil to</b> mix into <b>the loaves. Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon:</b> He <b>smears them</b> in a shape <b>similar</b> to the letter <b>chi, and the rest</b> of the oil <b>is eaten by the priests.</b>

### Part 13
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: In the case of ten <b>wafers that come by themselves</b> as a meal offering baked in the oven, and not as part of another offering, he <b>brings a <i>log</i> of oil and smears them, and he again smears them</b> repeatedly <b>until all the oil in the <i>log</i> is finished. Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon:</b> He <b>smears them</b> in a shape <b>similar</b> to the letter <b>chi, and the rest of the oil is eaten by the priests.</b>

### Part 14
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>All the meal offerings that are prepared in a vessel require breaking</b> into pieces.

### Part 15
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>To exclude what</b> does the mishna state that this <i>halakha</i> applies specifically to meal offerings prepared in vessels? <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> The mishna serves <b>to exclude the two loaves,</b> i.e., the public offering on Shavuot of two loaves baked from new wheat, <b>and the shewbread,</b> the twelve loaves that were placed on the Table in the Sanctuary each Shabbat. Since these are baked in an oven and not prepared in vessels, they do not require breaking into pieces.

### Part 16
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse discussing a meal offering prepared in a pan states: <b>“You shall break it in pieces,</b> and pour oil upon it; it is <b>a meal offering”</b> (Leviticus 2:6). The fact that the verse concludes with the phrase: “It is a meal offering,” indicates that the Torah means <b>to include all the meal offerings</b> in the requirement <b>of breaking</b> into pieces. One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I</b> should <b>include even the two loaves and the shewbread.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “You shall break <b>it</b> in pieces”; i.e., the meal offering baked in a pan, but not the two loaves and the shewbread.

### Part 17
The <i>baraita</i> continues that the same verse states: <b>“And you shall pour oil</b> upon it; it is <b>a meal offering.”</b> The fact that the verse concludes with the phrase “It is a meal offering” indicates that the Torah means <b>to include all the meal offerings</b> in the requirement <b>of pouring.</b> One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I</b> should <b>include even the</b> oven-<b>baked meal offering.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And you shall pour <b>oil upon it,”</b> i.e., upon this meal offering, but not upon the oven-baked meal offering.

### Part 18
The <i>baraita</i> concludes: Perhaps <b>I should exclude</b> only <b>the loaves</b> from the requirement of pouring, <b>but I should not exclude the wafers.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “It</b> is a meal offering,” indicating that wafers are also excluded. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the</b> biblical <b>derivation,</b> by which the term “it” excludes wafers specifically? Perhaps <b>I will say:</b> The term serves <b>to exclude the meal offering of priests</b> from the requirement of pouring.
