### Part 1
<b>only when he assigned it at the time of the vow. But</b> if at the time of the vow he simply said: It is incumbent upon me to bring a meal offering, and <b>at the time of the designation</b> of the fine flour as a meal offering he specified a particular type of meal offering, he is <b>not</b> obligated to bring that type, and if he brought a different type, he has still fulfilled his obligation.

### Part 2
The reason for this is that the Torah states: “That which has emerged from your lips you shall observe and do; <b>according to what you have vowed</b> freely to the Lord your God, even that which you have promised with your mouth” (Deuteronomy 23:24). Since it states: “According to what you have vowed,” <b>and not: According to what you have designated</b> to fulfill your vow, only matters specified as part of the vow are essential to its content.

### Part 3
It <b>was also stated</b> that <b>Rabbi Aḥa bar Ḥanina says</b> that <b>Rabbi Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The <i>tanna’im</i> <b>taught</b> in the mishna that meal offerings are not valid <b>only</b> when <b>he established their</b> type <b>at the time of the vow</b> and subsequently brought a different type of meal offering. <b>But</b> if he mentioned one type of meal offering <b>at the time of the designation</b> of the flour, and then brought it differently, it is <b>not</b> invalid, as the Torah states: <b>“According to what you have vowed,” and not: According to what you have designated</b> for your vow.

### Part 4
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who says:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a meal offering from barley, should bring</b> the meal offering <b>from wheat,</b> as voluntary meal offerings are brought exclusively from wheat. One who says: It is incumbent upon me to bring a meal offering from <b>flour, should bring</b> the meal offering from <b>fine flour,</b> as it is written: “His offering shall be of fine flour” (Leviticus 2:1). If one vows to bring a meal offering <b>without oil and without frankincense, he should bring</b> it with <b>oil and frankincense,</b> as voluntary meal offerings require oil and frankincense.

### Part 5
If one vows to bring as a meal offering <b>half a tenth</b> of an ephah, <b>he should bring a complete tenth</b> of an ephah, the minimum measure of a voluntary meal offering. If one vows to bring a meal offering of <b>a tenth and a half</b> an ephah, <b>he should bring two</b> tenths, as there are no partial tenths of an ephah brought in meal offerings. <b>Rabbi Shimon deems</b> one <b>exempt</b> from bringing a meal offering in all these cases. This is because the vow does not take effect, <b>as he did not pledge in the manner of those who pledge.</b>

### Part 6
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> is the vow to bring a meal offering from barley valid? <b>It is</b> seemingly a case of <b>a vow and its extenuation together.</b> The statement: It is incumbent upon me to bring a meal offering, is a valid vow, while the next term: From barley, constitutes a retraction, as the speaker knows that a meal offering may not be brought from barley.

### Part 7
<b>Ḥizkiyya said:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai, who say:</b> In the case of one who stated a declaration comprising two contradictory statements, <b>attend</b> only to <b>the first statement. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Nazir</i> 9a): If one says: <b>I am hereby a nazirite from dried figs and from</b> pressed <b>figs,</b> which is a contradictory statement, as figs are not prohibited to a nazirite, <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> He is a full-fledged <b>nazirite,</b> as one attends only to the first statement, i.e., I am hereby a nazirite, and the second part is discounted. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> The second part of his statement is not discounted, and therefore <b>he is not a nazirite,</b> as he did not accept naziriteship upon himself.

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the mishna here is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel.</b> It is referring <b>to</b> one who, upon being informed that such a vow is not effective, <b>says: Had I known that</b> one <b>cannot vow</b> in <b>this</b> manner to bring barley for a meal offering, <b>I would not have vowed</b> in <b>this</b> manner <b>but rather</b> in <b>that</b> manner, by vowing to bring wheat instead.

### Part 9
§ The Gemara cites another disagreement between Ḥizkiyya and Rabbi Yoḥanan about the mishna: <b>Ḥizkiyya says</b> that the Sages <b>taught</b> in the mishna <b>only</b> that <b>where he says:</b> It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a meal offering from barley,</b> he can bring a meal offering from wheat instead, <b>but</b> if he <b>says:</b> It is incumbent upon me to bring <b>a meal offering from lentils,</b> the vow is <b>not</b> valid.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>Now, Ḥizkiyya said</b> that <b>his tradition</b> of interpreting the mishna is that it is <b>in accordance with whose</b> opinion? It is <b>in accordance with Beit Shammai’s</b> opinion, <b>and Beit Shammai’s</b> ruling is <b>due to</b> the principle that one should <b>attend</b> only to <b>the first statement.</b> If so, <b>what</b> is the difference <b>to me</b> whether he vowed to bring a meal offering <b>from barley</b> or <b>from lentils?</b> In either case, that principle should require him to bring a meal offering from wheat. The Gemara answers: Ḥizkiyya <b>retracted his</b> initial explanation that the mishna is in accordance with Beit Shammai, and subscribes to the explanation of Rabbi Yoḥanan.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> that <b>he retracted</b> his explanation? <b>Rava said: The mishna</b> posed <b>a difficulty for him: Why does</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>specifically teach</b> this <i>halakha</i> using the example of <b>a meal offering from barley? Let it teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> using the example of a meal offering <b>from lentils,</b> which is a greater novelty.

### Part 12
<b>Rather, learn from</b> it that the reason the vow takes effect <b>is because</b> one may <b>err. With regard to barley,</b> it is reasonable that one may <b>err,</b> since one of the individual meal offerings, the meal offering of a <i>sota</i>, comes from barley. But <b>with regard to lentils,</b> one would <b>not err</b> in thinking that one may bring a meal offering from them. Therefore, one can presume that by saying: Lentils, he intended to negate his initial statement.

### Part 13
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> According to the mishna, <b>even</b> if he vowed to being a meal offering <b>from lentils,</b> the vow takes effect. The Gemara asks: <b>Now, Rabbi Yoḥanan states</b> that <b>his tradition</b> in interpreting the mishna is that it is <b>in accordance with whose</b> opinion? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel, and Beit Hillel</b> understand that the reason the meal offering takes effect <b>is because</b> one may reasonably <b>err.</b> One may <b>err with regard to barley</b> being fit for a meal offering, but <b>with regard to lentils,</b> he will <b>not err</b> that they are fit. Why then, does Rabbi Yoḥanan hold that the meal offering takes effect even if he said: Lentils?

### Part 14
The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yoḥanan does in fact hold that when he vows to bring a meal offering from lentils it is not valid. What he said was in response <b>to the statement of Ḥizkiyya.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan is saying to him: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>you retracted</b> your explanation of the mishna as being in accordance with the opinion of Beit Shammai? It is <b>because</b> the mishna <b>does not teach</b> using the example of one who vowed to bring a meal offering <b>from lentils,</b> which would have been a greater novelty.

### Part 15
Rabbi Yoḥanan questions this reasoning: <b>Perhaps</b> the mishna <b>is speaking</b> utilizing the style of: <b>It is not necessary. It is not necessary</b> to say that when one vows to bring a meal offering <b>from lentils,</b> the vow takes effect and he brings a meal offering from wheat. He brings it <b>because one has</b> reason <b>to say</b> that he in fact intended to vow and then <b>retracted</b> his initial statement, <b>and</b> yet the vow takes effect in accordance with the opinion of Beit Shammai that one should <b>attend</b> only to <b>the initial statement</b> and his retraction is disregarded. <b>But even</b> if he vowed to bring a meal offering <b>from barley, where one has</b> reason <b>to say he made an error,</b> and had he known that a meal offering is not brought from barley, he would not have vowed at all, <b>nevertheless,</b> the vow takes effect and he must bring a meal offering, due to the principle: <b>Attend</b> only to <b>the first statement.</b>
