### Part 1
<b>what do they do with,</b> i.e., how do they interpret, <b>this</b> verse: <b>“With which you cover yourself”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:12)? The Gemara answers that the Rabbis <b>require</b> it <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The phrase <b>“on the four corners of your garment”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:12) indicates that one is required to attach ritual fringes to a garment that has <b>four</b> corners, <b>but not</b> to one that has <b>three</b> corners.

### Part 2
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Do you say</b> that a garment with <b>four</b> corners is obligated <b>but not</b> a garment with <b>three</b> corners? <b>Or is it</b> teaching <b>only</b> that a garment with <b>four</b> corners is obligated <b>but not</b> a garment that has <b>five</b> corners? <b>When</b> the verse <b>states: “With which you cover yourself,”</b> a garment <b>with five</b> corners <b>is thereby mentioned</b> in the verse as being obligated. Then <b>how do I realize</b> the meaning of: <b>“On the four</b> corners of your garment”? It teaches that this obligation is limited to a garment that has <b>four</b> corners, <b>but not</b> to one that has <b>three</b> corners.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>But what did you see</b> that led you <b>to include</b> a garment <b>with five</b> corners <b>and to exclude</b> a garment <b>with three</b> corners, rather than including a garment with three corners and excluding a garment with five corners? The Gemara answers: <b>I include</b> a garment <b>with five</b> corners, <b>as five includes four, and I exclude</b> a garment <b>with three</b> corners, <b>as three does not include four.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> that a five-cornered garment is required to have ritual fringes? The Gemara answers: He <b>derives</b> it <b>from</b> the seemingly extraneous word: “With <b>which [<i>asher</i>]</b> you cover yourself” (Deuteronomy 22:12). The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what do <b>the Rabbis</b> derive from this word? The Gemara answers: <b>They do not learn</b> any new <i>halakhot</i> from the word <b>“which [<i>asher</i>].”</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the Rabbis, what do they do with this</b> phrase: <b>“That you may look upon it”</b> (Numbers 15:39), from which Rabbi Shimon derives that a nighttime garment is exempt? The Gemara answers: <b>They require it for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse: <b>“That you may look upon it and remember”</b> (Numbers 15:39), teaches that one should <b>see this mitzva</b> of ritual fringes <b>and remember another mitzva that is contingent on it. And which</b> mitzva <b>is that? It is</b> the mitzva of <b>the recitation of <i>Shema</i>. As we learned</b> in a mishna (Berakhot 9b): <b>From when may one recite <i>Shema</i> in the morning? From when</b> one can <b>distinguish between</b> the <b>sky-blue</b> strings <b>and</b> the <b>white</b> strings of his ritual fringes.

### Part 6
<b>And</b> it <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: The phrase <b>“that you may look upon it and remember”</b> teaches that one should <b>see this mitzva</b> of ritual fringes <b>and remember another mitzva that is adjacent to it</b> in the Torah. <b>And which</b> mitzva <b>is that? It is the mitzva of diverse kinds</b> of wool and linen, <b>as it is written: “You shall not wear diverse kinds, wool and linen together. You shall prepare yourself twisted cords”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:11–12).

### Part 7
It <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“That you may look upon it and remember all the commandments of the Lord”</b> (Numbers 15:39). This indicates that <b>once a person is obligated in this mitzva</b> of ritual fringes, <b>he is obligated in all of the mitzvot.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>And this is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who says</b> that ritual fringes are <b>a positive, time-bound mitzva,</b> and women are exempt from it. Only men are obligated in all mitzvot, including positive, time-bound mitzvot, just as they are obligated in the mitzva of ritual fringes.

### Part 8
It <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“That you may look upon it and remember all the commandments of the Lord”;</b> this teaches that <b>this mitzva</b> of ritual fringes <b>is equivalent to all the mitzvot</b> of the Torah.

### Part 9
<b>And</b> it <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“That you may look upon it and remember</b> all the commandments of the Lord <b>and do</b> them.” This teaches that <b>looking</b> at the ritual fringes <b>leads to remembering</b> the mitzvot, and <b>remembering</b> them <b>leads to doing</b> them. <b>And Rabbi Shimon bar Yoḥai says: Anyone who is diligent in this mitzva</b> of ritual fringes <b>merits receiving the Divine Presence.</b> It is <b>written here: “That you may look upon it [<i>oto</i>]”</b> (Numbers 15:39), <b>and it is written there: “You shall fear the Lord your God; and Him [<i>oto</i>] shall you serve”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:13). Just as <i>oto</i> in that verse is referring to the Divine Presence, so too in this verse it is referring to the Divine Presence.

### Part 10
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Jewish people are beloved, as the Holy One, Blessed be He, surrounded them with mitzvot:</b> They have <b>phylacteries on their heads, and phylacteries on their arms, and ritual fringes on their garments, and a <i>mezuza</i> for their doorways. Concerning them David said: “Seven times a day I praise You, because of Your righteous ordinances”</b> (Psalms 119:164). This alludes to the two phylacteries, the four ritual fringes, and the <i>mezuza</i>, which total seven.

### Part 11
<b>And when David entered the bathhouse and saw himself standing naked, he said: Woe to me that that I stand naked without</b> any <b>mitzva. But once he remembered the</b> mitzva of <b>circumcision that was in his flesh his mind was put at ease,</b> as he realized he was still accompanied by this mitzva. <b>After he left</b> the bathhouse, <b>he recited a song about</b> the mitzva of circumcision, <b>as it is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“For the leader, on the <i>Sheminith</i>: A Psalm of David”</b> (Psalms 12:1). This is interpreted as a psalm <b>about circumcision, which was given</b> to be performed <b>on the eighth [<i>bashemini</i>]</b> day of the baby’s life.

### Part 12
<b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: Anyone who has phylacteries on his head, phylacteries on his arm, ritual fringes on his garment, and a <i>mezuza</i> on his doorway is strengthened</b> from <b>all</b> sides <b>so that he will not sin, as it is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“And a threefold cord is not quickly broken”</b> (Ecclesiastes 4:12). This is interpreted as an allusion to the three mitzvot of phylacteries, ritual fringes, and <i>mezuza</i>. <b>And</b> the verse <b>states: “The angel of the Lord encamps round about them that fear Him, and delivers them”</b> (Psalms 34:8). This is interpreted to mean that the angel of the Lord surrounds those who fulfill the mitzvot and saves them from sin.

### Part 13
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say: What is different about <i>tekhelet</i> from all</b> other <b>types of colors</b> such that it was chosen for the mitzva of ritual fringes? It is <b>because <i>tekhelet</i> is similar</b> in its color <b>to</b> the <b>sea, and</b> the <b>sea is similar to</b> the <b>sky, and</b> the <b>sky is similar to the Throne of Glory, as it is stated:</b> “And they saw the God of Israel; <b>and there was under His feet the like of a paved work of sapphire stone, and the like of the very heaven for clearness”</b> (Exodus 24:10), indicating that the sky is like a sapphire brickwork. <b>And it is written: “The likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone”</b> (Ezekiel 1:26).

### Part 14
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say:</b> The <b>punishment for</b> not attaching <b>white</b> strings is <b>greater than the punishment for</b> not attaching <b>sky-blue</b> strings, despite the fact that the sky-blue strings are more important. Rabbi Meir illustrates this with <b>a parable: To what is this matter comparable?</b> It is comparable <b>to a king of flesh and blood who said to his two subjects</b> that they must bring him a seal. The king <b>said to one</b> of them: <b>Bring me a seal of clay, and he said to</b> the other <b>one: Bring me a seal of gold. And both of them were negligent and did not bring</b> the seals. <b>Which of them</b> will have <b>a greater punishment? You must say</b> that it is <b>this</b> one <b>to whom he said: Bring me a seal of clay, and</b> despite its availability and low cost, he <b>did not bring</b> it.

### Part 15
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say: A person is obligated to recite one hundred blessings every day, as it is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“And now, Israel, what [<i>ma</i>] does the Lord your God require of you”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:12). Rabbi Meir interprets the verse as though it said one hundred [<i>me’a</i>], rather than <i>ma</i>.

### Part 16
The Gemara relates that <b>on Shabbat and Festivals,</b> when the prayers contain fewer blessings, <b>Rav Ḥiyya, son of Rav Avya, made an effort to fill</b> this quota of blessings <b>with</b> blessings on <b>spices [<i>be’isparmakei</i>] and sweet fruit,</b> of which he would partake in order to recite extra blessings.

### Part 17
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say: A man is obligated to recite three blessings every day</b> praising God for His kindnesses, and <b>these</b> blessings <b>are: Who did not make me a gentile; Who did not make me a woman;</b> and <b>Who did not make me an ignoramus.</b>

### Part 18
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov heard his son reciting the blessing: Who did not make me an ignoramus.</b> Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov <b>said to him:</b> Is it <b>in fact</b> proper to go <b>this far</b> in reciting blessings? Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov’s son <b>said to him: Rather, what blessing</b> should one <b>recite?</b> If you will say that one should recite: <b>Who did not make me a slave, that is</b> the same as <b>a woman;</b> why should one recite two blessings about the same matter? Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov answered: Nevertheless, <b>a slave</b>
