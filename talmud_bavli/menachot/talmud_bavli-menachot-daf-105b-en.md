### Part 1
<b>with it and says</b> the following stipulation: <b>If this</b> offering is one <b>of a leper,</b> i.e., if I am a leper, <b>this is his guilt offering and that is his <i>log</i></b> of oil. <b>And if</b> I am <b>not</b> a leper, <b>this</b> animal that I brought for <b>a guilt offering</b> shall be <b>a gift peace offering,</b> because their sacrificial rites are equivalent.

### Part 2
<b>And that</b> uncertain <b>guilt offering requires slaughter in the north</b> of the Temple courtyard, as does a guilt offering; <b>and placement</b> of the blood on the right <b>thumb, and</b> right <b>big toe,</b> and right ear of the leper, as described in Leviticus 14:14; <b>and</b> it requires <b>placing hands</b> on the head of the animal, <b>and</b> the accompanying wine <b>libations, and waving of the breast and thigh,</b> as does a peace offering. <b>And it is eaten by males of the priesthood for</b> one <b>day and</b> the following <b>night</b> like a guilt offering, and not for two days and the intervening night like a peace offering.

### Part 3
The Gemara relates to the problem that arises from this stipulation, as treating an offering as two different types of offerings due to a stipulation can cause a situation where an offering is unduly disqualified. In the case of an offering that is sacrificed as both a peace offering and a guilt offering, if its meat is not eaten by dawn of the following day, it is disqualified, even though it might be a peace offering, which can be eaten for another day. The Gemara comments: <b>And even though a Sage resolves</b> this issue <b>in</b> the tractate of: <b>The slaughter of sacrificial</b> animals, i.e., tractate <i>Zevaḥim</i>, in a manner that would not enable a stipulation to be made in this case (see 76b), there is a distinction between the case discussed there and the case discussed here.

### Part 4
The resolution given there was: <b>Say that Rabbi Shimon said</b> that in a case of uncertainty <b>one may bring</b> an offering <b>and stipulate</b> with regard to its type <b><i>ab initio</i></b> only <b>for the remedy of a man,</b> e.g., in order to purify a person from his uncertain status as a leper, as there is no other way for him to purify himself. <b>But in general, after the fact,</b> after uncertainty arose with regard to the status of a certain offering it is <b>indeed</b> permitted to sacrifice the offering in a manner that may reduce the amount of time allotted for eating it, but one may <b>not</b> consecrate such an offering <b><i>ab initio</i>.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara explains why here it would nevertheless be permitted to make the stipulation <i>ab initio</i>: Nevertheless, <b>this statement</b> that one may stipulate with regard to an offering only after the fact applies only <b>to a peace offering, as</b> sacrificing it as a guilt offering <b>reduces its</b> allotted time for <b>eating, which</b> may bring <b>sacrificial</b> meat <b>to the status of disqualification. But</b> stipulation with regard to <b>meal offerings</b> when one does not remember which type he vowed to bring is permitted <b>even <i>ab initio</i>,</b> as this does not reduce its allotted time for eating. Therefore, the mishna could be in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye:</b> How can you explain that the mishna could be in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who said</b> that if one wants to bring <b>half</b> of his baked meal offering as <b>loaves and half</b> of it as <b>wafers he may bring</b> it in that manner, as one can bring a meal offering of ten loaves and ten wafers and stipulate that some of them are brought in order to fulfill his obligation and the rest are a voluntary offering? This cannot be, as the twenty loaves and wafers constitute a total of two-tenths of an ephah in volume, and must therefore be sanctified in two separate service vessels. This causes a situation where <b>one brings one-tenth</b> of an ephah, which constitutes one meal offering as fulfillment of the individual’s obligation, <b>from two</b> separate <b>tenths</b> of an ephah. <b>And</b> similarly, the two meal offerings require two <i>log</i> of oil, each of which is sanctified in a separate vessel, and it turns out that each meal offering includes <b>one <i>log</i></b> of oil <b>from two</b> separate <b><i>log</i>.</b>

### Part 7
Abaye answered: This is not difficult, as <b>we have heard that Rabbi Shimon said</b> that <b>if one brought one-tenth</b> of an ephah as a meal offering <b>from two</b> separate <b>tenths, and</b> similarly, if one brought <b>one <i>log</i></b> of oil <b>from two</b> separate <b><i>log</i>, he has fulfilled</b> his obligation.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>But how does one remove a handful</b> from this meal offering, which consists of both loaves and wafers? The Gemara answers <b>that he stipulates and says: If</b> I specified in my vow that I would bring <b>loaves only, or</b> similarly if <b>I said</b> that I would bring <b>wafers only, let the handful that I remove from the loaves be for the loaves,</b> and <b>let the handful that I remove from the wafers be for the wafers. If I said</b> in my vow that I would bring a meal offering that is <b>half wafers and half loaves, let the handful that I remove from the loaves be for half the loaves and half the wafers, and let the handful that I remove from the wafers be for half the wafers and half the loaves.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara challenges this suggestion: <b>But</b> if the vow was to bring a meal offering that is half loaves and half wafers, <b>it requires removing one handful from the loaves</b>
