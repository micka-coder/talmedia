and it is practiced both <b>in</b> the cases of offerings when they are <b>alive,</b> e.g., the guilt offering of a leper and the lambs of <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>and in</b> the cases of offerings after they are <b>slaughtered,</b> e.g., the breast and thigh. By contrast, placing hands is practiced with a live animal. A further stringency is that waving is practiced both <b>in</b> the case of <b>an item in which there is a living spirit,</b> i.e., an animal offering, <b>and in</b> the case of <b>an item in which there is not a living spirit,</b> e.g., the <i>omer</i> offering, the <i>sota</i> meal offering, and the loaves accompanying a thanks offering and the ram of the nazirite, whereas placing hands is only ever performed upon living beings.

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to placing hands: “And he shall place his hand on the head of his offering” (Leviticus 3:2). The term <b>“his offering”</b> serves <b>to include all</b> of the <b>owners of an offering</b> in the requirement <b>of placing hands,</b> i.e., each one must perform it.

### Part 3
It is necessary for the verse to teach this, <b>as</b> one <b>might</b> have thought: <b>Could it not</b> be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference</b> that only one partner needs to place his hands on the offering? The inference is as follows: <b>If</b> the requirement of <b>waving, which was amplified to apply</b> also <b>to slaughtered</b> animals, nevertheless <b>was limited with regard to</b> an offering jointly owned by a number of <b>partners,</b> as only one of them waves on behalf of all of them, then with regard to the requirement of <b>placing hands, which was not amplified to apply</b> also <b>to slaughtered</b> animals, <b>is it not logical that it was</b> also <b>limited with regard to</b> an offering jointly owned by <b>partners,</b> and it is sufficient for one partner to place his hands on behalf of the others? To counter this inference, <b>the verse states: “His offering,” to include each of the owners of an offering in</b> the requirement of <b>placing hands.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> one could suggest the opposite inference and conclude that the requirement of <b>waving should be amplified with regard to partners, through</b> the following <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If</b> the requirement of <b>placing hands, which was not amplified to apply</b> also <b>to slaughtered</b> animals, <b>was amplified with regard to</b> an offering jointly owned by <b>partners,</b> requiring each partner to perform it himself, then with regard to the requirement of <b>waving, which was amplified to apply</b> also <b>to slaughtered</b> animals, <b>is it not logical that it was</b> also <b>amplified with regard to</b> an offering jointly owned by <b>partners,</b> requiring each partner to perform it himself?

### Part 5
The Gemara rejects this: This inference cannot be correct, <b>because</b> it is obvious that only one of the partners needs to perform the waving. <b>It is not possible</b> to have all of them perform it, <b>as how would it be done?</b> If one says: <b>Let all of</b> the partners <b>wave together,</b> with each one placing his hands under those of another, that is difficult: There <b>would be</b> an invalidating <b>interposition</b> between the offering and hands of the partners who are not directly holding onto the offering. And if one says: <b>Let</b> one partner <b>wave, and then</b> the next one <b>will wave,</b> and so on, that would also be invalid, as <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah that one must perform <b>a waving,</b> using a singular noun, which indicates that one waving, <b>but not</b> multiple <b>wavings,</b> should be performed.

### Part 6
§ The mishna states that placing hands is not performed upon a slaughtered offering. The Gemara questions this: <b>And is there no</b> instance of <b>placing hands</b> performed <b>on slaughtered</b> animals? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Tamid</i> 33b): <b>When the High Priest</b> would <b>want to sacrifice</b> the daily offering, as it is his right to be the one to sacrifice it whenever he wishes to, <b>he would ascend the ramp</b> to the top of the altar, <b>and the deputy [<i>segan</i>]</b> High Priest would also ascend <b>to the right</b> of the High Priest. If it occurred that the High Priest <b>reached halfway</b> up <b>the ramp</b> and grew tired, the <b>deputy</b> would <b>hold</b> him <b>by his right hand</b> to assist him <b>and</b> would <b>bring him up</b> to the top of the altar. <b>And the first</b> of the group of priests who had been selected to bring the limbs of the daily offering to the altar would <b>hold out the head and the</b> right hind <b>leg</b> of the offering to the High Priest, <b>who would place</b> his <b>hands upon them, and</b> then <b>he would throw</b> the limbs onto the fire of the altar.

### Part 7
Then <b>the second</b> priest <b>would hold out the two forelegs to the first</b> priest, and the first priest would <b>give them to the High Priest,</b> who would <b>place</b> his <b>hands upon them and</b> then <b>throw them</b> onto the fire. At this stage <b>the second priest</b> would <b>slip away and leave,</b> as he was no longer needed. The first priest remained where he was, as he was still needed to present the other limbs of the offering to the High Priest. <b>And in this manner</b> the other priests who had been selected <b>would hold out the rest of all the limbs</b> to the first priest, who would present them to the High Priest, who would then <b>place</b> his <b>hands upon them and throw them</b> onto the fire.

### Part 8
The mishna concludes: <b>And when</b> the High Priest <b>wants, he</b> may merely <b>place</b> his <b>hands</b> upon the limbs, <b>and</b> then the <b>other</b> priests <b>throw</b> the limbs onto the fire of the altar.

### Part 9
This mishna apparently demonstrates an instance of placing hands performed upon a slaughtered animal. In resolution of this difficulty, <b>Abaye said:</b> In the mishna <b>there,</b> the placing of hands is not in fulfillment of the requirement to do so to an offering; rather, it is done merely <b>due to the eminence of the High Priest,</b> so that his sacrifice of the limbs of an offering is more distinguished than when performed by ordinary priests.
