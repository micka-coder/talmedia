### Part 1
case is <b>where one wrote them on <i>dokhsostos</i> on the side</b> that faced the <b>flesh.</b> In both of these situations the phylacteries are unfit, but a <i>mezuza</i> that one wrote on parchment is fit.

### Part 2
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> that if one <b>changed whether in this</b> manner <b>or in that</b> manner it is unfit is in fact referring to a <i>mezuza</i> that one wrote on parchment, and this <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>changed in this</b> manner <b>or in that</b> manner it is <b>unfit. Rabbi Aḥa, in the name of Rabbi Aḥai, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, deems</b> it <b>fit; and some say</b> he said this ruling <b>in the name of Rabbi Akiva, son of Rabbi Ḥanina.</b>

### Part 3
§ The <i>baraita</i> indicates <b>that</b> if it were permitted to <b>reduce</b> the sanctity of an item from a level of greater sanctity to a level of lesser sanctity, one could <b>make</b> a <i>mezuza</i> from phylacteries that became worn. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> a <i>mezuza</i> <b>requires scoring,</b> i.e., the parchment must have lines etched in it before writing, <b>as Rav Minyumi bar Ḥilkiya says</b> that <b>Rav Ḥama bar Gurya says</b> that <b>Rav says: Any <i>mezuza</i> that is not scored</b> is <b>unfit, and Rav Minyumi bar Ḥilkiya himself says</b> concerning this: <b>The scoring of a <i>mezuza</i></b> is <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai.</b> With regard to phylacteries, by contrast, he does not teach that their parchment requires scoring.

### Part 4
The Gemara answers that this <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yirmeya says in the name of our teacher,</b> Rav: <b>Phylacteries and <i>mezuzot</i> may be written</b> when the scribe is <b>not</b> copying <b>from a written</b> text, <b>and</b> their parchment <b>does not require scoring.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that the parchment of <b>phylacteries does not require scoring, but</b> the parchment of <b>a <i>mezuza</i> requires scoring. And</b> unlike a Torah scroll, both <b>these and those,</b> phylacteries and <i>mezuzot</i>, <b>may be written</b> when the scribe is <b>not</b> copying <b>from a written</b> text. <b>What is the reason</b> for this leniency? These short texts <b>are well known</b> to all scribes, and therefore it is permitted to write them by heart.

### Part 6
In connection to Rav Ḥelbo relating the customs of Rav Huna, the Gemara cites that <b>Rav Ḥelbo says: I</b> myself <b>saw Rav Huna as</b> he wished <b>to sit on his bed, which had a Torah scroll</b> placed <b>on it. And he overturned a jug on the ground and placed the Torah scroll on it, and</b> only <b>then sat on the bed.</b> The reason he did so is that <b>he holds</b> that it is <b>prohibited to sit on a bed upon which a Torah scroll is placed.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>disagrees</b> with a ruling <b>of Rabba bar bar Ḥana, as Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: It is permitted to sit on a bed upon which a Torah scroll is placed. And if a person whispers to you, saying:</b> There was <b>an incident involving Rabbi Elazar, who was sitting on a bed and realized that a Torah scroll was placed on it, and</b> he immediately <b>slipped off</b> the bed <b>and sat upon the ground, and</b> in doing so he looked <b>like one who had been bitten by a snake,</b> i.e., he jumped up in a panic, that incident is no proof. <b>There,</b> the <b>Torah scroll was</b> placed <b>on the ground.</b> It is certainly disgraceful for one to sit on a bed while a Torah scroll is on the ground.

### Part 8
The Gemara returns to the discussion about the <i>halakhot</i> of writing a <i>mezuza</i>. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> If one <b>wrote</b> a <i>mezuza</i> in the manner of <b>a missive</b> that one composes to a friend, i.e., without being exact about the lettering of each word, it is <b>unfit. What is the reason?</b> This is <b>derived</b> by a verbal analogy between <b>“writing,”</b> and <b>“writing,” from a scroll,</b> which must be written in precisely the correct manner.

### Part 9
<b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> If <b>one hung</b> a <i>mezuza</i> <b>on a stick</b> in the entranceway, without affixing it to the doorpost, it is <b>unfit. What is the reason? We require</b> the fulfillment of the verse: “And you shall write them upon the doorposts of your house, and <b>upon your gates”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:9). <b>This</b> ruling <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one hung</b> a <i>mezuza</i> <b>on a stick, or placed it</b> so that it was affixed <b>behind the door</b> within the house, he exposes himself to <b>danger, and it</b> does <b>not</b> enable him to fulfill the <b>mitzva.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara relates: The members <b>of the household of King Munbaz would do so,</b> i.e., hang <i>mezuzot</i> on sticks, <b>in their inns,</b> i.e., when they would sleep in an inn. They would not do this in order to fulfill the mitzva, as one who sleeps in an inn is exempt from placing a <i>mezuza</i>, but <b>in remembrance of</b> the <b><i>mezuza</i>.</b> Since they would travel frequently, they wanted to remember the mitzva of <i>mezuza</i>, which they did not fulfill often.

### Part 11
<b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> It is <b>a mitzva to place</b> the <i>mezuza</i> <b>within the airspace of the entrance,</b> not on the outside. The Gemara asks: Isn’t this <b>obvious?</b> After all, <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “And <b>upon your gates,”</b> which indicates that it must be within the area of the gate, rather than the outside. The Gemara explains that it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since Rava says:</b> It is <b>a mitzva to place</b> the <i>mezuza</i>
