<b>within it. And lest you say: Just as the opening</b> of Gehenna <b>is narrow, so</b> too, <b>all of</b> Gehenna <b>is narrow, the verse states:</b> “For Gehenna has been arranged of old, it has been prepared even for the king, <b>deep and large,</b> its pile is fire and much wood, the breath of the Lord kindles it like a stream of brimstone” (Isaiah 30:33).

### Part 2
<b>And lest you say</b> that Gehenna is prepared only for ordinary people, but <b>it is not prepared for</b> important individuals such as <b>a king, the verse states: “It has been prepared even for the king.” And lest you say there is no wood in</b> Gehenna, <b>the verse states: “Its pile is fire and much wood.” And lest you say</b> that <b>this,</b> i.e., escaping Gehenna, <b>is</b> the only <b>reward</b> for Torah study, <b>the verse states: “And that which is set on your table is full of fatness”</b> (Job 36:16). This indicates that one who obeys God and turns from the paths of death to the paths of life is not only saved from Gehenna, he also attains tranquility and prosperity.

### Part 3
§ The mishna states: If <b>Yom Kippur occurs on Shabbat,</b> the loaves are distributed on Saturday night. If Yom Kippur occurs on Friday, the goat sin offering of Yom Kippur is eaten Friday night, on Shabbat. Since there was no possibility of cooking the meat, the Babylonian priests would eat it raw. The Gemara notes: <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> These priests <b>are not</b> actually <b>Babylonians. Rather, they are Alexandrians,</b> i.e., priests who came from Egypt. <b>But since</b> the Jews of Eretz Yisrael <b>hate</b> the Jewish <b>Babylonians, they would call</b> the gluttonous Alexandrians <b>by the name Babylonians.</b>

### Part 4
<b>This</b> interpretation of the mishna <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> These priests <b>are not</b> actually <b>Babylonians. Rather, they are Alexandrians. But since</b> the Jews of Eretz Yisrael <b>hate</b> the <b>Babylonians, they would call</b> the gluttonous Alexandrians <b>by the name Babylonians. Rabbi Yehuda,</b> whose family originated from Babylonia, <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yosei, after hearing this explanation: <b>May your mind be at ease, because you have put my mind at ease.</b>

### Part 5
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one <b>arranged the bread</b> on the Table <b>on Shabbat but</b> arranged <b>the bowls</b> of frankincense only <b>after Shabbat,</b> then if he subsequently <b>burned</b> the frankincense placed in <b>the bowls on the</b> following <b>Shabbat,</b> the loaves are <b>unfit</b> for consumption, since the frankincense had not been on the Table for the entire week. Since the burning of the frankincense did not render the loaves permitted for consumption, <b>one is not</b> ever <b>liable for</b> eating <b>them due to</b> violation of the prohibitions of <b><i>piggul</i></b> or <b><i>notar</i>, or</b> for partaking of the shewbread when one is <b>ritually impure.</b> One violates these prohibitions only if the frankincense is burned in a manner that permits consumption of the shewbread.

### Part 6
If one <b>arranged the bread and the bowls</b> of frankincense <b>on Shabbat but</b> then <b>burned</b> the frankincense that was in <b>the bowls after the</b> following <b>Shabbat,</b> that burning of the frankincense is <b>not valid</b> and the shewbread is unfit for consumption. <b>And</b> since the frankincense was not burned in a manner that permits consumption of the shewbread, <b>one is not</b> ever <b>liable for</b> eating <b>them due to</b> violation of the prohibitions of <b><i>piggul</i></b> or <b><i>notar</i>, or</b> for partaking of the shewbread when one is <b>ritually impure.</b>

### Part 7
If <b>one arranged the bread and the bowls</b> of frankincense <b>after Shabbat and burned</b> the frankincense that was in <b>the bowls on the</b> subsequent <b>Shabbat,</b> the burning of the frankincense is <b>not valid</b> and the shewbread is unfit for consumption. <b>How should</b> one <b>act</b> to prevent the shewbread from being rendered unfit? One should not remove the shewbread and frankincense from the Table on the subsequent Shabbat. Rather, <b>he should leave it</b> on the Table <b>until the following Shabbat,</b> so that it remains on the Table for a full week from Shabbat to Shabbat. It is permitted to leave the bread and frankincense on the Table beyond seven days, <b>as even</b> if <b>it is on the Table</b> for <b>many days</b> there is <b>nothing</b> wrong <b>with that,</b> i.e., it is not rendered unfit.

### Part 8
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Yoma</i> 28a) with regard to the Yom Kippur service in the Temple: <b>The appointed</b> priest <b>said to</b> the other priests: <b>Go out</b> and stand on a high point in the Temple <b>and see if</b> it is day and <b>the time for slaughtering</b> the daily offering <b>has arrived,</b> as one may not slaughter offerings at night. <b>If</b> the time <b>has arrived, the observer says: There is light [<i>barkai</i>]. Mattitya ben Shmuel</b> maintained that one should wait until greater light is observed. Therefore, when he was the appointed priest, he <b>would say: Is the entire eastern</b> sky <b>illuminated,</b> even <b>to Hebron? And</b> the observer <b>would say: Yes.</b>

### Part 9
The mishna asks: <b>And why did they need to</b> institute <b>this,</b> to send someone to observe the first light from a high place? The mishna explains that this was deemed necessary <b>because once, the light of the moon rose and</b> the priests <b>imagined that the eastern</b> sky <b>was illuminated</b> with sunlight. <b>They</b> then <b>slaughtered the daily offering, and</b> when they realized that it had been slaughtered too early <b>they had to take it out to the place</b> designated <b>for burning</b> and burn it. In order to prevent similar errors in the future, the Sages instituted that they should carefully assess the situation and ensure that day has begun before slaughtering the daily offering.

### Part 10
The mishna continues: Once the daylight was observed on Yom Kippur, the priests <b>led</b> the <b>High Priest down to the Hall of Immersion.</b> The mishna comments: <b>This was the principle in the Temple: Anyone who covers his legs,</b> a euphemism for defecating, <b>requires immersion</b> afterward; <b>and anyone who urinates requires sanctification of hands and feet</b> with water from the Basin afterward.

### Part 11
<b>The father of Rabbi Avin teaches</b> a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Not only</b> in <b>this</b> case, with regard to slaughtering the daily offering, did the Sages say that if it is performed at night it is disqualified, <b>but even</b> in the case of <b>a bird burnt offering whose</b> nape <b>was pinched at night, and</b> in the case of <b>a meal offering</b> from <b>which a handful was removed at night,</b> the offering is disqualified and <b>must be taken out to the place</b> designated <b>for burning.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, a bird burnt offering</b> is disqualified if pinched at night, <b>as it cannot be restored</b> to its former state. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>a meal offering</b> whose handful was removed at night, why is it burned? It is <b>possible</b> to remedy the situation, <b>as</b> the priest <b>can restore</b> the <b>handful to its</b> original <b>place and</b> then <b>remove a handful</b> from the meal offering once again <b>during the day.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara replies that the father of Rabbi Avin <b>teaches</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>and he says its</b> explanation: <b>Service vessels sanctify</b> their contents even <b>when</b> those contents are <b>not</b> placed in the vessel <b>at</b> the appointed <b>time for</b> that service. Once the handful is placed in the service vessel it acquires the sanctity inherent to the handful and the situation can no longer be remedied.

### Part 14
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>. <b>Any</b> offering <b>that is sacrificed during the day is consecrated</b> by a service vessel only <b>during the day,</b> and any offering that is sacrificed <b>at night is consecrated</b> by a service vessel only <b>at night,</b> and any offering that is sacrificed <b>both during the day and at night is consecrated both during the day and at night.</b>

### Part 15
The <i>baraita</i> teaches that <b>any</b> offering <b>that is sacrificed during the day is consecrated during the day,</b> from which one can infer that <b>during the day, yes,</b> it is consecrated, but it is <b>not</b> consecrated <b>at night.</b> This indicates that the handful of the meal offering is not consecrated at night, contrary to the explanation of Rabbi Avin’s father. The Gemara answers: When an offering is placed in a service vessel not at the appointed time, the contents <b>are not</b> sufficiently <b>consecrated to be sacrificed</b> on the altar, <b>but they are</b> sufficiently <b>consecrated to be disqualified.</b>

### Part 16
<b>Rabbi Zeira raises an objection</b> from the mishna: If <b>one arranged the bread and the bowls</b> of frankincense <b>after Shabbat and burned</b> the frankincense that was in <b>the bowls on the</b> subsequent <b>Shabbat,</b> the burning of the frankincense is <b>not valid</b> and the shewbread is unfit for consumption. <b>How should</b> one <b>act</b> to prevent the shewbread from being rendered unfit? One should not remove the shewbread on the subsequent Shabbat. Rather, <b>he should leave it</b> on the Table <b>until the following Shabbat,</b> so that it remains on the Table for a full week from Shabbat to Shabbat. It is permitted to leave the bread and frankincense on the Table beyond seven days, <b>as even</b> if <b>it is on the Table</b> for <b>many days</b> there is <b>nothing</b> wrong <b>with that,</b> i.e., it is not rendered unfit.

### Part 17
Rabbi Zeira explains: <b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that <b>service vessels sanctify</b> their contents <b>to</b> the extent that those contents <b>are disqualified</b> even <b>when</b> they are <b>not</b> placed in the vessel <b>at</b> the appointed <b>time,</b> then even if the shewbread is arranged after Shabbat <b>it should be sanctified</b> by the Table <b>and</b> subsequently <b>disqualified</b> by being left overnight.

### Part 18
<b>Rabba said: The one who raises the objection,</b> Rabbi Zeira, <b>raises the objection well.</b> Nevertheless, <b>the father of Rabbi Avin is also stating a <i>baraita</i>,</b> and the difficulty must therefore be resolved. Rabba explains: The <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> cited by Rabbi Avin’s father <b>maintains</b> that in the case of a rite that should be performed during the day, if it is performed during the preceding <b>night</b> it is <b>not</b> considered a rite <b>whose time has not yet</b> arrived, as the night and day are considered a single unit. Therefore, if one places the handful in a service vessel at night the service vessel sanctifies the handful, and since the rite is not valid the offering is disqualified. <b>But</b> if a rite is performed several <b>days</b> earlier it is considered a rite <b>whose time has not yet</b> arrived. Therefore, the Table does not sanctify shewbread that is placed on it on any day except Shabbat.

### Part 19
The Gemara asks: <b>Ultimately,</b>
