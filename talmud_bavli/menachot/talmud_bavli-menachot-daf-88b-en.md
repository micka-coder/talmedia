### Part 1
one can counter that the rite <b>is</b> performed <b>outside</b> the Temple, and so it does not require a service vessel. <b>And if</b> you suggest it was for measuring the oil for the loaves of <b>a nazirite,</b> one can counter that the <b>loaves of a nazirite are consecrated through the slaughter of</b> the <b>ram</b> he brings, and there is no need for the oil to have been consecrated through a service vessel.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: The consecration of the quarter-<i>log</i> measuring vessel was necessary, <b>as with it one would measure</b> oil <b>for</b> the <b>High Priest’s griddle-cake</b> offering, as <b>a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> <b>of oil</b> is used <b>for each and every loaf.</b> In praise for resolving his difficulty, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>read</b> the verse <b>about</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya, who had traveled from Babylonia to join Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi in Eretz Yisrael: <b>“The man of my counsel from a far country”</b> (Isaiah 46:11).

### Part 3
§ The mishna teaches: <b>What</b> purpose <b>did</b> the <b>half-<i>log</i></b> measuring vessel <b>serve?</b> It was used to measure a half-<i>log</i> of water for the <i>sota</i> and a half-<i>log</i> of oil for the thanks offering. The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>was sitting</b> in study <b>and posed a difficulty: For what</b> purpose <b>was</b> the <b>half-<i>log</i></b> measuring vessel <b>anointed</b> with the anointing oil, thereby consecrating it a service vessel? <b>If</b> you suggest it was necessary in order to measure the water used in the rite of the <b><i>sota</i>,</b> one can counter: <b>Is</b> the water that was used <b>non-sacred</b> such <b>that it is necessary to consecrate</b> it? Isn’t <b>it written:</b> “And the priest shall take <b>holy water</b> in an earthen vessel” (Numbers 5:17)? And <b>if</b> you suggest that it was for measuring the oil for the loaves of <b>a thanks offering,</b> one can counter that the <b>loaves of a thanks offering are consecrated through the slaughter of</b> the <b>thanks offering,</b> and so there is no need for the oil to have been consecrated through a service vessel.

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>said to</b> his father: The consecration of the half-<i>log</i> measuring vessel was necessary, <b>as with it one would distribute a half-<i>log</i> of oil to each and every lamp</b> of the Candelabrum. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to</b> his son in praise: <b>Lamp of Israel!</b> Indeed, <b>that was</b> its use.

### Part 5
§ Apropos the lamps of the Candelabrum, the Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> If there is <b>a lamp whose</b> flame <b>went out</b> during the night, <b>the oil</b> in the lamp <b>is</b> halakhically <b>rendered as ashes</b> and <b>the wick is rendered as ashes,</b> and they may no longer be used. <b>How</b> should the priest <b>act? He removes the ashes,</b> i.e., the oil and wick, from the lamp, <b>and puts</b> new <b>oil</b> and a new wick <b>into it and kindles it.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rav Zerika was sitting</b> and studying this <i>halakha</i> <b>and raised a dilemma: When</b> the priest <b>puts oil</b> in the lamp, does he fill it <b>with</b> the <b>same quantity</b> of oil that was <b>initially</b> used, i.e., a half-<i>log</i>, <b>or</b> does he just fill it <b>with</b> an amount <b>equal to what it</b> now <b>lacks,</b> in order to replace the oil that was removed?

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya said:</b> It is <b>obvious that</b> he fills it <b>with</b> the <b>same quantity</b> of oil that was <b>initially</b> used, <b>as, if</b> he were to fill <b>with</b> an amount <b>equal to what it</b> now <b>lacks,</b> there would be a difficulty: <b>How do we know how much</b> oil it <b>lacks? And if you would say that</b> the priest <b>calculates it</b> using a measuring vessel, one could counter that <b>if so,</b> there would not be only <b>seven measuring vessels</b> for liquids; rather, <b>there would</b> have to be <b>many more measuring vessels</b> of a whole range of volumes.

### Part 8
In praise for resolving his difficulty, Rabbi Zerika <b>read</b> the verse <b>about</b> Rabbi Yirmeya: <b>“And in your majesty prosper, ride on, on behalf of truth and meekness and righteousness”</b> (Psalms 45:5).

### Part 9
An amoraic ruling <b>was also stated</b> in accordance with the explanation of Rabbi Yirmeya: <b>Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says, and some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> If there is <b>a lamp whose</b> flame <b>went out</b> during the night, <b>the oil</b> in the lamp <b>is rendered as ashes</b> and <b>the wick is rendered as ashes,</b> and they may no longer be used. <b>How</b> should the priest <b>act? He removes the ashes,</b> i.e., the oil and wick, from the lamp, <b>and puts into it oil of</b> the <b>same quantity</b> that was <b>initially</b> used, with a new wick, <b>and kindles it.</b>

### Part 10
§ <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehuda, says</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet says:</b> Each <b>lamp of</b> the Candelabrum <b>in the Temple was movable,</b> as the branches holding it were thin and flexible. They could therefore be bent over in order to tip out any ashes, remaining oil, or wicks from the lamps. The basis for his opinion is the verse: “And you shall make a Candelabrum of pure gold, of beaten work the Candelabrum shall be made, its base, and its shaft; its cups, its knobs, and its flowers, will be from it…of a talent of pure gold it shall be made” (Exodus 25:31, 39).

### Part 11
The Gemara explains that Rav Sheshet <b>holds</b> that <b>when it is written</b> that the Candelabrum is to be fashioned from a single <b>talent</b> of gold, <b>and</b> that it <b>be beaten</b> into its form, <b>it is written with regard to</b> both the frame of <b>Candelabrum and</b> each of <b>its lamps,</b> i.e., they must all be fashioned together from a single piece of gold beaten into its form. Perforce, the lamps must have been movable, because <b>since it is necessary to remove the ashes</b> from the lamps, <b>were</b> each lamp <b>not movable, it would not be</b> possible <b>to remove the ashes.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rav Sheshet’s opinion from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How</b> would the priest <b>act</b> when removing the ashes from the lamps? <b>He</b> would <b>remove</b> the lamps from the Candelabrum <b>and place them in the Tent</b> of Meeting, i.e., the Sanctuary, <b>and scrub them with a sponge [<i>bisfog</i>]</b> to remove any remaining oil. <b>And</b> then he would <b>put</b> fresh <b>oil into them and kindle them.</b> Evidently, the lamps and the frame of the Candelabrum were separate parts.

### Part 13
The Gemara explains that there is a dispute between <i>tanna’im</i> concerning this issue and Rav Sheshet <b>states</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>that <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Rabbis say</b> that when removing the ashes, the priest <b>would not move</b> the lamp <b>from its place;</b> rather, he would remove the ashes while the lamp was still attached to the frame.

### Part 14
The Gemara raises a difficulty: But <b>from the fact</b> that the <i>baraita</i> states that the priest would not move the lamp from its place, it would appear <b>that if one wanted to move it, he was able to move it</b> from its place. Apparently, then, the lamps were independent parts. The Gemara explains: <b>Rather,</b> emend the <i>baraita</i> to <b>say:</b> The lamp <b>would not move from its place,</b> as the lamps were not independent removable parts but were formed together with the frame from a single piece of gold.

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>And whose</b> opinion is expressed by <b>the Rabbis</b> in the <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, as it is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says: There was a kind of gold plate [<i>tas</i>] for</b> each lamp, which was placed <b>on top of it</b> and which served as a cover for the lamp. The plate was attached to one side of the lamp, to the lamp’s head, and the wick emerged from the other side, from the lamp’s mouth. <b>When</b> the priest <b>would</b> come to <b>remove the ashes</b> from the lamp, <b>he would</b> first <b>push</b> up on the part of the plate <b>at the mouth of</b> the lamp, thereby exposing its contents. The lamp would then be bent over and its contents tipped out. And <b>when he would</b> come to <b>place</b> fresh <b>oil</b> and a wick <b>in</b> the lamp, <b>he would</b> place the new wick at its mouth and then <b>push</b> down on the plate <b>at the head of</b> the lamp, thereby closing it, then he would straighten it up and pour in the oil through a hole in the middle of the plate.

### Part 16
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> whether or not the lamps were independent removable parts <b>is the subject of a dispute</b> between <b>these</b> following <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Both the frame of the <b>Candelabrum and its lamps are produced</b> together <b>from the</b> same <b>talent</b> of gold. <b>But its tongs and its pans,</b> which were the implements used for removing the ashes, <b>were not</b> fashioned <b>from that</b> same gold <b>talent. Rabbi Neḥemya says:</b> Only the frame of the <b>Candelabrum is produced from the talent</b> of gold, <b>but its lamps and its tongs and its pans are not produced from that</b> same gold <b>talent;</b> rather, they are formed independently. The lamps are then positioned on the frame, but can still be removed from it.

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what do</b> these <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree?</b> The Gemara explains: They disagree <b>with regard to</b> the exposition of <b>this verse, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: From the verse: <b>“Of a talent of pure gold it shall be fashioned</b> with all these vessels” (Exodus 25:39), <b>we learned about the</b> frame of the <b>Candelabrum that</b> it <b>is produced from the</b> gold <b>talent. From where</b> is it derived <b>to include its lamps,</b> that they should also be fashioned together with the frame from the same talent? <b>The verse states:</b> “It shall be fashioned <b>with all these vessels.”</b> This indicates that not only the frame, but also additional parts should be fashioned from the same talent. If so, one <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I</b> should <b>include even its tongs and its pans.</b> To counter this, <b>the verse states: “It</b> shall be fashioned.” The additional word “it” teaches that only the frame and the lamps are to be fashioned from the gold talent. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Neḥemya.</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara interrupts the citation of the <i>baraita</i> and notes that the <b>statement of Rabbi Neḥemya</b> in this <i>baraita</i>, in which he claims the lamps were fashioned from the talent with the frame, is <b>difficult,</b> as it is contradicted <b>by</b> the <b>statement of Rabbi Neḥemya</b> in the other <i>baraita</i>, in which he claims the lamps were independent parts. The Gemara explains: There are <b>two <i>tanna’im</i>, and</b> they disagree <b>with regard to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Neḥemya.</b>

### Part 19
The Gemara resumes its citation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa says:</b> Only the frame of the <b>Candelabrum was produced from the talent</b> of gold, <b>but its tongs and its pans and its lamps were not produced from the talent. Rather, how do I realize</b> the meaning of the verse: “Of a talent of pure gold it shall be fashioned <b>with all these vessels”?</b> It teaches only <b>that</b> all the <b>vessels</b> associated with the Candelabrum <b>were</b> made <b>of gold,</b> even though they were not fashioned from the same gold talent from which the Candelabrum and its lamps were.

### Part 20
The Gemara questions the need for the derivation of the <i>baraita</i>: But the requirement that the vessels be made of <b>gold is explicitly written in</b> the verse: <b>“And you shall fashion its lamps seven, and they shall kindle its lamps, and it will enlighten toward its face. And its tongs and its pans shall be of pure gold”</b> (Exodus 25:37–38); why then is it necessary for the <i>baraita</i> to derive this from the phrase “with all these vessels”? The Gemara explains: This derivation of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is necessary only to</b> teach that the same applies <b>to</b> the <b>mouth of</b> the <b>lamps,</b> where the wicks rest. Otherwise, it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since</b> the <b>mouth of</b> the <b>lamps blackens</b> and is damaged by the burning wick, therefore the principle that <b>the Torah spared the money of the Jewish people</b> should be applied,
