<b>O Lord! How long</b> -He foresaw with the Holy Spirit that Nebuchadnezzar was destined to be the ruler of the world and to cause trouble for Israel, as the matter is stated in his prophecy (1:6): “For behold, I raise up the Chaldeans, etc.” He was complaining for this. 
<b>I cry out to You of violence</b> I mention before You the violence committed against me, and You do not save me. 

### passuk 3
<b>iniquity</b> plunder and violence. 
<b>and look upon mischief</b> You look upon this mischief, but You do not help. 
<b>and the one who bears quarrel and strife endures</b> And this wicked man who bears quarrel and strife, will live, remain in existence, and prosper. 
<b>endures</b> He who bears quarrel and strife will endure. So did <i>Jonathan</i> render. 

### passuk 4
<b>Therefore Torah is slackened</b> Because of this, that Israel sees his [the wicked man’s] success, the Torah will slacken and leave them; and they [Israel] will obey him [the wicked man] and prostrate themselves before the idol in the valley of Dura. 
<b>and justice does not go out forever</b> I.e., the true decision of the Law. 
<b>surrounds</b> surrounds, as in (<a class="refLink" href="/Psalms.22.13" data-ref="Psalms 22:13">Ps. 22:13</a>): “Strong bulls of Bashan have surrounded me (כִּתְּרוּנִי).” 

### passuk 5
<b>You shall not believe when it is told</b> When this is told to you, that I am setting up the Chaldeans, the people that did not deserve to be created, as it is written (<a class="refLink" href="/Isaiah.23.13" data-ref="Isaiah 23:13">Isa. 23:13</a>): “This people has never been.” They are one of three things whose creation God regrets, and now [they] will rise, and [they] will be bitter, and [they will be] impetuous to run and to march to the breadth of the lands of all the nations. 

### passuk 7
<b>from themselves their judgment and their burden shall emanate</b> From them are judges; from them are kings, who cast a burden and a fear upon all. <b>their judgment</b> <i>joustice</i> in O.F: 

### passuk 8
<b>and their riders shall increase</b> Heb. וּפָשוּ. 

### passuk 9
<b>come to commit violence</b> to plunder and to spoil. 
<b>the eagerness of their faces</b> an expression like (<a class="refLink" href="/Genesis.24.17" data-ref="Genesis 24:17">Gen. 24: 17</a>) “Give me to swallow, (הַגְמִיאִינִי) I pray you” and (<a class="refLink" href="/Job.39.24" data-ref="Job 39:24">Job 39:24</a>) “He swallows (יְ גַמֶּה) the earth.” He runs swiftly - in a short time a distance of a day’s plowing - as though he had swallowed and drunk the earth that is before him. Here, too, the swallowing of their faces; the swallowing, the longing of their faces resembles the east wind, the fiercest of the winds. So did <i>Jonathan</i> render this. 

### passuk 10
<b>And they shall mock the kings</b> shall mock them. Every expression of קַלָּסָה is an expression for the speech of those speaking about another; some [of these speeches] are for good, and some for bad - <i>parledic</i> in O.F. 
<b>a laughingstock</b> like שְּׂחוֹק, laughter, like מִשְׁמָר, a watch, and מִסְתָּר, a hiding place. 
<b>He shall scoff at every fortress</b> If his enemy is in a strong fortress, he scoffs at him. 
<b>he piles up earth</b> upon it with his many armies, each one carrying a load of earth. It [the pile] is before the wall as a high mound, and they [the Chaldeans] battle from upon it. This is called שְׁפִיכַת סוֹלְלָה, pouring a siege mound (cf. <a class="refLink" href="/Isaiah.37.33" data-ref="Isaiah 37:33">Isa. 37:33</a>), for all of them are translated into Aramaic: וְיִצְבּוֹר עֲלָה מְלֵיתָא, and he piled upon it a filling. This is an expression of Milo, for in the city of David there was a high mound, and they would battle upon it. Atop the mound was built a tower whose slant was inclined to the sides, and around its base was a low wall to prevent the earth from falling. 

### passuk 11
<b>Then a spirit goes further</b> Then, when they see their way prospering, a spirit of guilt goes further and passes over them. Now what is the spirit? <b>this strength they attribute to their god</b> This strength they attribute to their god, and they say, “My god acquired all this wealth for me.” Says the prophet, “Now, You, why should You remain silent to all this?” 

### passuk 12
<b>Are You not from everlasting, O Lord, my God, my Holy One?</b> Who shall not die. Now, the reason it is written לֹא נָמוּת we shall not die, is that it is one of the emendations of the scribes in Scripture, by which Scripture euphemizes. Likewise, (<a class="refLink" href="/Malachi.1.13" data-ref="Malachi 1:13">Mal. 1:13</a>) “And you sadden it.” And so are many of them [these euphemisms] explained in <i>Sifre</i> (<a class="refLink" href="/Numbers.10.35" data-ref="Numbers 10:35">Num. 10:35</a>). According to the emendation of the scribes, this is its explanation: Are you not my God from everlasting, my Holy One? Do not deliver us into their hands to die. 
<b>O Lord, You have ordained them for judgment</b> I know that You have set this one [Nebuchadnezzar] up only to judge those who rebel against You. In any case, why should all this come about? Is it not so that... 

### passuk 13
<b>[You are] of eyes too pure</b> to behold evil? 
<b>gaze</b> like וּלְהַבִּיט, and to gaze upon iniquity. 
<b>one more righteous than he</b> that he will blind the eyes of Zedekiah (<a class="refLink" href="/II_Kings.25.7" data-ref="II Kings 25:7">II Kings 25:7</a>). 

### passuk 14
<b>And You have made man</b> before this wicked man - free as the fish of the sea, which anyone who wishes may catch. 

### passuk 15
<b>He takes all of them up with the fishhook</b> This wicked man takes up all people with his fishhook. 
<b>catches them</b> an expression of (<a class="refLink" href="/Proverbs.6.8" data-ref="Proverbs 6:8">Prov. 6:8</a>) “Gathers (אָגְרָה) her food in the harvest,” and (<a class="refLink" href="/Joel.1.17" data-ref="Joel 1:17">Joel 1: 17</a>) “Granaries (מַמְּגֻרוֹת) are demolished.” 

### passuk 16
<b>he sacrifices to his net</b> To his god, for he says that it conquers everyone before him. 
<b>through them</b> This is similar to בהם, because of them. 
<b>a fatling</b> fat. 

### passuk 17
<b>Because of this does he arm himself with his net</b> There are many interrogative forms that are affirmative, e.g., (<a class="refLink" href="/I_Samuel.2.27" data-ref="I Samuel 2:27">I Sam. 2:27</a>) “Did I appear?” concerning Eli, and (<a class="refLink" href="/II_Samuel.15.27" data-ref="II Samuel 15:27">II Sam. 15:27</a>) “Do you see?” Here, too: Does it appear in Your eyes that because of this he prospers every time, in that he arms himself with his net over everyone and to hunt game? <b>arms himself</b> As in (<a class="refLink" href="/Genesis.14.14" data-ref="Genesis 14:14">Gen. 14:14</a>) “And he armed (וַיָּרֶק) his trained men” and (<a class="refLink" href="/Psalms.35.3" data-ref="Psalms 35:3">Ps. 35:3</a>): “Arm yourself (הָרֵק) with a spear.” He arms himself with his net.
