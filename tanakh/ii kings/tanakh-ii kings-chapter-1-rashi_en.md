<b>Through the lattice.</b> <i>Gradil</i>, in Latin. I say that they were accustomed to weave it as a warp and a woof with long and short boards, which is called (<i>lates</i>) <i>cantineli</i>, in Latin, and it was made full of holes like sort of a net, and it is called <i>prodne</i>, in O.F. But I heard that שְׂבָכָה is <i>wiz</i>, in O.F., and in German, <i>schwindel</i> <i>steg</i>, as I explained [in], “and by a winding stairway they went up.”<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">Melochim 2:1</i>
<b>And he became ill.</b> An expression of sickness.<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">IMelochim 6:8.</i>

<b>And Yehorom reigned in his place.</b> He was his brother.
<b>In the second year of Yehorom, son of Yehoshophot.</b> Is it possible to say this? Did he not reign in the nineteenth year of Yehoshophot? For Achazyah reigned in the seventeenth year [of Yehoshophot] and he reigned for two years,<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">The root of the word is חלה (=to become ill).</i> and also, below it is written, “In the eighteenth year of Yehoshophot,”<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">He did not reign for a full two years. He reigned during two different years, and his total reign might have been less than one year, covering only the last few months of one year and the first few months of the following year.—Ralbag</i> that Yehorom reigned, and Yehoshophot reigned twenty-five years before Yehorom, his son, reigned.<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote">Below 3:1.</i> But, Yehoshophot deserved to be killed in Ramos Gilad, but as a reward for [his] crying out, his [death] was suspended for seven years,<sup>6</sup><i class="footnote">According to Radak, the seven years discrepancy is resolved as follows. Yehoshophot gave over the throne to Yehorom during his lifetime because he wanted to establish Yehorom as his successor and to prevent conflict among the brothers. This occurred at the end of Yehoshophot’s reign. The first seven years of Yehorom’s reign were while his father was alive. The second year of Yehorom’s reign corresponds with the year that Yehorom son of Achov became king over Yisroel, as stated below in 3:1.</i> and from that time [Scripture] counts [the years] to his son.<sup>7</sup><i class="footnote">Tosefta Maseches Sotah 12:2. </i>
