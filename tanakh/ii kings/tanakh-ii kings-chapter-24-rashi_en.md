<b>Yehoyakim lay with his forefathers.</b> [He did] not die in his bed, for Nevuchadnetzar bound him with chains to take him to Bavel, and when they were dragging him he died in their hands,<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture therefore, does not mention his burial. There are several different opinions surrounding the circumstances of Yehoyakim's death and burial. See Vayikra Rabboh 19:6.</i> as it is stated, ”With the burial of a donkey will he be buried, dragged and thrown,”<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">Yirmiyahu 22:19.</i> and in Divrei Hayomim it is written<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">II Divrei Hayomim 36:6. The verse there states, “Nevuchadnetzar king of Bavel attacked him [Yehoyakim] and bound him in chains to take him to Bavel.”</i> that Nevuchadnetzar bound him to take him to Bavel.

### passuk 7
<b>Left his land.</b> To aid Yehoyakim.
<b>For the king of Bavel had taken, etc.</b> For he defeated him in battle in the fourth year of Yehoyakim in Charchemish on the Euphrates River, as it is written in the Book of Yirmiyohu.<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote">46:2.</i>

<b> Yehoyachin king of Yehudah, came out to the king of Bavel.</b> That he do to him as he wishes, and not for war.<sup>6</sup><i class="footnote">Nevuchadnetzar, at this time, did not come to destroy Yerusholayim. He only demanded that Yehoyachin be handed over to him. See Vayikra Rabboh 19:6.</i>

<b>Craftsmen and gatekeepers.</b> [Targum] Yonoson rendered the craftsmen and the sentries of the gates. But, our Rabbis said that these were great Torah scholars,<sup>7</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., “craftsmen and gatekeepers” is a metaphoric allusion to Torah scholars. See Maseches Sanhedrin 38a.</i> that when one would begin [to speak], all remained silent [=חרש], as it is written, “Be silent before Me, O islands.”<sup>8</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshayohu 41:1.</i> ”מסגר” [is one who] all sit before him and learn from him, as it is stated, ”And he will open, and no one will close, and he will close, and no one will open.”<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid 22:22.</i> <sup>10</sup><i class="footnote">See Maseches Gittin 88a.</i>

### passuk 15
<b>And the dignitaries of the land.</b> These are the dignitaries of Yehudah and Binyomin, who were righteous men. Concerning them Scripture states, ”Like these good figs, so will I recognize the exiles of Yehudah.”<sup>11</sup><i class="footnote">Yirmiyahu 24:5.</i>

### passuk 16
<b>Seven thousand.</b> But above he states, “ten thousand.”<sup>12</sup><i class="footnote">Above, v. 14.</i> The third verse comes to reconcile [the difference], in the Book of Yirmiyohu, ”This is the people whom Nevuchadnetzar exiled in the seventh year, three thousand Jews.”<sup>13</sup><i class="footnote">Yirmiyahu 52:28. The verse there states, “three thousand and <i>twenty-three</i> Jews.”</i> We deduce from here that three thousand were of the tribe of Yehudah and seven thousand were of Binyomin and the other tribes. Also in Seder Olam we learned this.

### passuk 17
<b>And changed his name to Tzidkiyohu.</b> May God justify the judgment upon you if you rebel against me.<sup>14</sup><i class="footnote">See Maseches Horiyos 11b.</i>

<b>Indeed the wrath of Hachem was, etc.</b> Therefore, Tzidkiyohu rebelled against the king of Bavel. The Holy One, Blessed Is He, gave him the desire to rebel against him in order that he would be exiled.<sup>15</sup><i class="footnote">God incited Tzidkiyohu to rebel in order to exile the Bnei Yisroel from Eretz Yisroel.</i>
