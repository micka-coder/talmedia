<b>In the twenty-seventh year of Yorovom, etc.</b> Is it possible to say so? Did not Uzziyoh<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">Azaryoh and Uzziyohu refer to the same person. See below verses 13 and 32.</i> and Yorovom reign simultaneously, as was explained just before? What, then, is the meaning of the verse, ”In the twenty-seventh year of Yorovom … Azaryoh … became king”? That [from that year] he reigned a plagued kingship, [i.e.,] that he was stricken with <i>tzora'as</i> in the twenty-seventh year of his reign.

<b>Hachem brought a plague upon the king.</b> It is explained in Divrei Hayomim<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">II Divrei Hayomim 26:16-21.</i> that he entered the Temple to burn incense on the Incense Altar.<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">He was punished with <i>tzora'as</i> for attempting to assume the role of the <i>Kohen gadol</i> and burn incense on the altar. See II Divrei Hayomim 26-16:21 and Rashi in Bamidbar 17:5.</i>
<b>In a retirement house.</b> He made himself a house in the cemetery,<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">The word חפשי means freedom. The Gemara in Maseches Horiyos 10a explains that Uzziyohu became “free” of the duties of being king. Targum indicates that he lived outside the walls of Yerusholayim. The reason is because a <i>metzora</i> is forced to live in isolation. He was therefore unable to attend to his royal duties and was thus “freed” from his responsibilities.</i> <sup>5</sup><i class="footnote">The house was in the cemetery because our Rabbis taught in Maseches Nedarim 12b that a <i>metzora</i> is accounted as dead. And like the dead who is free from the many toils of life, as it states in Tehilim 88:6, “I am [considered] among the dead who are free,” so is a <i>metzora</i>.</i> as it is stated, ”I am [considered] among the dead who are free.”<sup>6</sup><i class="footnote">Tehilim 88:6.</i> In [Talmud] Yerushalmi.

<b>In the thirty-eighth year of Azaryohu king of Yehudah, Zecharyoh … became king.</b> From here too, it is possible to deduce that Azaryoh[u] reigned from the time that Yoash king of Yisroel died, fifteen years during the lifetime of Amatzyoh his father, for if he did not become [king] until his father died, it follows that he did not become [king] until the fifteenth year of Yorovom son of Yoash. Now, since Yorovom reigned forty-one years, it follows that Yorovom died in the twenty-seventh year of Uzziyoh. So, how does [Scripture] state, “In the thirty-eighth year?” Rather, we are forced [to deduce] that Uzziyoh and Yorovom reigned simultaneously, except that Yorovom reigned during the lifetime of his father Yehoash—three years. Therefore [Scripture] states, ”and Yorovom had sat on his throne,”<sup>7</sup><i class="footnote">Above, 13:13.</i> [i.e., on the throne] that he had already sat. And Uzziyoh became [king] when Yoash died and Yorovom reigned over a complete monarchy. I saw in Seder Olam that Yorovom reigned one year during his father's lifetime, and I do not know whether it is the writers' error, for I cannot reconcile, ”In the thirty-eighth year of Azaryohu … Zecharyohu … reigned,” except in this manner.

<b>In the twentieth year of Yosam.</b> He should have said, “in the fourth year of Achaz,” because Yosam's entire reign lasted [only] sixteen years, but since Achaz was wicked, Scripture prefers to count [the years with reference] to Yosam who was in the grave, rather than to Achaz, who was alive.<sup>13</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, because the Divine decree of destruction had been passed against Pekach during Yosam's reign, therefore its fulfillment is reckoned in terms of his reign even though it took place after his death.—Radak</i> Thus it is [stated] in Seder Olam.
