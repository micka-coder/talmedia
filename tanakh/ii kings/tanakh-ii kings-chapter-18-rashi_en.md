<b>And he called it Nechushton.</b> A derogatory expression,<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">The additional “nun” to the word נחשת serves to belittle and mock the subject. See II Shmuel 13:20.</i> as though to say, “Why is this necessary?<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">The copper serpent was not destroyed before now because it was incorrectly believed that one may not destroy any object that was made as a result of a Divine command. The serpent was originally made to encourage the Bnei Yisroel to pray to God after they were bitten by poisonous snakes. See Bamidbar 21:4-10 and Tosfos in Maseches Chulin 7a. It is also possible that they kept the copper serpent as a remembrance of the great miracle that occurred, just as they kept the jar of manna, in Shemos 16:33-35.</i> It is nothing but a copper serpent.”<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, the Bnei Yisroel who were worshiping it called it the Nechushton.—Targum</i>

<b>Removed.</b> The doors, which were gold [plated].
<b>And the thresholds.</b> [Targum] Yonoson rendered the סקופיא, [i.e.,] the thresholds.<sup>8</sup><i class="footnote">Alternately, אמנות are pillars, or it is a term used to include both the threshold and the lintel.—Ralbag</i>

### passuk 17
<b>Tarton [and] Rav Soris.</b> We learned in Seder Olam that the three of them did not come together,<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote">The king of Ashur dealt falsely with Chizkiyoh because he sent his officers to attack Yerusholayim even though Chizkiyoh paid the tribute that was imposed upon him.—Metzudas Dovid Or, Sancheiriv took the tribute and left. However, in the ensuing years Chizkiyohu failed to meet his demands and he therefore attacked again.—Radak</i> rather but Ravshokei [came] alone, as it is written in the Book of Yeshayohu,<sup>10</sup><i class="footnote">36:2.</i> and Tarton and Rav Soris came on a second mission, when he received word concerning Tirhokoh king of Cush, ”and he heard and sent emissaries to Chizkiyohu … ”<sup>11</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshayohu 37:9.</i>
<b>Near the channel.</b> <i>Fosed</i>, in O.F., [i.e.,] a moat made for schools of fish.
<b>The washer's field.</b> A field in which the launderers spread out garments, And so did [Targum] Yonoson render, ”a field where the launderers spread out.”<sup>12</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., where the launderers spread out the clothing.</i>

<b>The recorder.</b> [Who determines] which judgment came first before the king, that it be adjudicated first.<sup>13</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi in Yeshayohu 36:3 defines מזכיר, as “the writer of the records in the annals.”</i>

<b>You have said but words of the lips, etc.</b> Until now you have said, ”I will (not) pay tribute to the king of Ashur.” It was but words of the lips, as long as he did not leave his place to march upon you, you did not require counsel and might. But now, that he has left [his place] and marched [upon you], you require counsel and might for this war. Now, tell [me] upon whom you have depended?

### passuk 21
<b>It will go into his palm.</b> When a person supports himself on a support of a splintered reed, which has broken in his hand, the splintered edges come and puncture his palm.<sup>14</sup><i class="footnote">Similarly, his reliance on Paroh for support will turn out to be bad for him.</i>

### passuk 22
<b>Is He not the one Whose high places and altars Chizkiyohu has removed, etc.</b> It can be deduced from here that Ravshokei was an apostate Jew, for he admitted that the Holy One, Blessed Is He, is God, but his desire is to worship idols.<sup>15</sup><i class="footnote">See Maseches Sanhedrin 60a.</i>

### passuk 23
<b>Provide a security.</b> Glorify yourself over him; enter a wager on the condition that if you are able to supply riders for two thousand horses.<sup>16</sup><i class="footnote">Ravshokei implied that Chizkiyohu did not even have enough riders for the two thousand horses, so surely he is unable to mount a rebellion.—Ralbag</i>
<b>Wager.</b> <i>Gajer</i>, in O.F.

### passuk 24
<b>How can you turn away one captain of my master's servants.</b> For the smallest of them is captain over two thousand men, and you cannot obtain two thousand men. We deduce from here concerning the heads of the armies, who totaled one hundred and eighty-five thousand and fell with Sancheiriv, that the smallest of them was captain over two thousand men who were with him.

### passuk 25
<b>Is it with other than Adonoy.</b> Did I come without permission? Yeshayohu already prophesied in the days of Achaz your father, ”Adonoy shall bring upon you and upon your people, etc., the king of Ashur.”<sup>17</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshayohu 7:17. Radak cites another verse from Yeshayohu's prophecy, “and therefore the LRD is bringing upon them the mighty and abundant waters of the river, the king of Ashur, etc.,” in Yeshayohu 8:7. Sancheiriv therefore believed that he was acting with Divine approval.</i>
<b>And to destroy it.</b> This he added of his own accord.

### passuk 26
<b>For we understand it.</b> We are residents of the palace, and understand Aramaic and other languages. But do not speak Hebrew to us, which all the people understand,<sup>18</sup><i class="footnote">They were concerned about the morale of the people and therefore wanted to keep the conversation private.</i> and we do not want them to hear.<sup>19</sup><i class="footnote">It is not proper to reveal matters of war to the general public.—Metzudas Dovid</i>

### passuk 27
<b>To eat their own excrement.</b> In the hunger [caused] by the siege.<sup>20</sup><i class="footnote">If they continue guarding the wall to prevent Ashur's army from entering, they will lay a prolonged siege to the city that will be so severe that the people will starve during the siege, causing them to “eat their own, etc.”—Ralbag</i>
<b>Their dung.</b> Dung that is excreted through the orifice of the anus. Our Rabbis explained to euphemize and read, “צואתם” [instead of חריהם].<sup>21</sup><i class="footnote">See Maseches Megillah 25b.</i>
<b>Their own urine.</b> Loose excrement, the glands of the rectum, which is held by three glands. Alternatively, an expression of excrement which comes about through the chewing of the teeth [=שניהם].

<b>”Make peace with me.”</b> A greeting, as in, “And Yaakov greeted [=ויברך] Paroh.”<sup>22</sup><i class="footnote">Bereishis 47:7.</i> <sup>23</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi in Bereishis 33:10 and above, in II Melochim 5:15.</i>

### passuk 32
<b>To a land like you land.</b> This is my custom to move the nations from province to province. He should have said, “to a land better than yours,” because he came to persuade them, but he knew that they would recognize that his statement was false.<sup>24</sup><i class="footnote">This custom was practiced in order to prevent any future attempts to regain independence. He realized that as long as a conquered nation remained in its own land, the people would ultimately rise up and rebel against their conquerors.</i> <sup>25</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi, in Yeshayohu 36:17. The Gemara in Maseches Sanhedrin 94a, states that Sancheiriv did not say “to a land better than yours,” because he did not want to denigrate Eretz Yisroel. As a result he was rewarded with the title “the great and noble Osenapar [=Sancheiriv],” in Ezra 4:10.</i>
<b>A land of grain and wine.</b> This is Africa.

<b>He exiled them and twisted them.</b> The King of Ashur, destroyed them and exiled them.<sup>26</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, “Heina and Iva” were provinces or deities.—Radak</i>

<b>With torn garments.</b> Because they heard blasphemies of the Name [of God].<sup>27</sup><i class="footnote">See Maseches Sanhedrin 60a. One who hears another Jew blaspheme God must rend his clothing. Ravshokei's blasphemy was in comparing God to the pagan deities.—Radak Alternatively, they rend their clothing on account of the terrible news and threats that they just heard, an event similar to II Shmuel 13:31 and II Melochim 5:7.</i>
