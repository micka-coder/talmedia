<b>And the Copper Altar … he brought, etc.</b> It is impossible to say that this was the Copper Altar that Moshe made, because it was hidden. It is also impossible to say that his was the stone altar that Shlomo made, and he called it the “Copper Altar,”<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">II Divrei Hayomim 7:7.</i> because it was impossible to move it from one corner to another without taking it apart,<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, “he placed the new altar near the Copper Altar, i.e., near Shlomo's altar which is referred to as the Copper Altar. He placed it closer to the Sanctuary than Shlomo's altar without moving that altar to show that it was important to him.—Radak</i> but we learned that the fire that descended in Shlomo's time, did not leave the altar until Menashe came and removed it,<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Zevachim 61b.</i> for he demolished the altar, as we find in the Aggadah of [the chapter entitled] “Cheilek.”<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote">See Maseches Sanhedrin 103b.</i> I have no way to explain this “[copper] altar” except as [referring to] the basin and the bases of copper, which were accessories of the altar and were near the holy altar. Now, when Achaz made the altar for the idols, he removed the basin and moved it to another side, [farther] away from the Temple, so as not to intervene between the altar he made and the Temple of Hachem, and he placed it next to the holy altar on the north. We find that our Rabbis<sup>6</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Shabbos 55a.</i> explained a passage in a similar manner, ”And they came and stood next to the Copper Altar.”<sup>7</sup><i class="footnote">Yechezkeil 9:2.</i> Did the Copper Altar exist? He said to them, ”Begin from the place where they recite songs before Me.” Thus we see here that copper musical instruments are referred to as a “[copper] altar.”<sup>8</sup><i class="footnote">It follows then, that the copper basin which is an accessory to the altar is referred to as “the Copper Altar.”</i>

<b>To visit.</b> At intervals, when it enters my mind to visit it.<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote">The Copper Altar will be for occasional use, thereby, establishing the new altar as the primary one.</i>

<b>The frames of the bases.</b> The rows upon which the bases were made,<sup>10</sup><i class="footnote">He removed the bases from the ten basins, and out of contempt, he set the basins on a stone floor.—Radak</i> as it is stated, ”The bases were made in the following manner: They had frames … ”<sup>11</sup><i class="footnote">I Melochim 7:28.</i> <sup>12</sup><i class="footnote">See I Melochim 7:23-27.</i>

<b>The canopy for Shabbos.</b> The roof of a tent made for shade,<sup>13</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, a building in which the mishmar, i.e., the family of <i>kohanim</i> that had served during the week, would stay until after Shabbos. That too he removed.—Radak</i> to sit under it in the [Temple] courtyard on Shabbos.
<b>And the king's … entrance.</b> [The entrance] through which he would come, from his house to the Beis [Hamikdosh] of Hachem through the outside,<sup>14</sup><i class="footnote">He sealed up that entrance so that access to the palace could be gained only through the Beis Hamikdosh. This would make an attack on the palace more difficult because now the only access to the palace would be through the Beis Hamikdosh.—Ralbag</i> he changed to a concealed place because of the king of Ashur, so that he would not covet those vessels, and he also changed the entrance, in case he would have to hide and secretly escape.
