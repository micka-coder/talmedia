<b>And he will hear a rumor.</b> And he will withdraw from you and return to his land. He will not [return] because of the rumor, but after a while he will return to his land in disgrace, and I will cause him to fall there by the sword. Now what was the rumor? ”And he heard about Tirhaikoh.”<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshayohu 45:14.</i> He heard that Tirhaikoh had gone out to wage war against him, so, he left Yerusholayim and went to Cush, and waged war with Tirhaikoh, and Egypt, who were with him. He defeated him and took their most coveted treasures, and came to Yerusholayim, where he fell. In reference to this, Yeshayohu stated, ”The toil of Egypt and the merchandise of Cush, etc., will become yours, etc.”<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote">See commentary above, 18:34.</i>

<b>The highest mountains.</b> [This refers to] the Temple Mount.<sup>7</sup><i class="footnote">The sacrifices that are offered in the Beis Hamikdosh atoned for the sins and “whitened” them. The verse in Yeshayohu 1:18 states, “If your sins will be like scarlet, they will become as white [=ילבינו] as snow.” See Maseches Gittin 56b and Rashi there.</i>
<b>To the end of the Levanon.</b> [This refers to] the Beis Hamikdosh which whitens [=מלבן] sins.<sup>8</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively “its tallest cedar [trees]” refers to the great leaders and nobles among the Bnei Yisroel.—Radak See Rashi in Bamidbar 13:20.</i>
<b>And I will cut down its tallest cedar [trees].</b> I will not return until I have destroyed it.<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote">”Its remotest lodge,” refers to the Beis Hamikdosh which is the lodging place of the Shechinah.—Radak</i>

### passuk 24
<b>I dug and drank strange water.</b> I.e., I started all my deeds and completed [them], as one who digs a hole and finds flowing water and drinks it. Flowing water he calls “זרים [=strange],” because until now no one knew of them.
<b>And I dry up with the soles of my feet.</b> If I besiege a city that depends upon its rivers, I bring many troops upon it who dry up its rivers with their drinking and the drinking of their cattle<sup>11</sup><i class="footnote">His soldiers were so numerous that as they crossed a river they carried away so much water on their feet that the river bed was left dry by the time they all crossed it. See Maseches Sanhedrin 95b.</i> and by the treading of their feet.<sup>12</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshayohu 10:5.</i>
<b>And I dry up.</b> This is in the present tense [because] this is always my way.

### passuk 25
<b>Have you not heard from afar.</b> Why do you glorify and aggrandize yourself with this? This is not yours, for you have heard from afar through the prophets, that I decreed upon the nations to bring you upon them, as the matter that is stated, ”Ho, Ashur, the staff of My wrath.”<sup>13</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshayohu 30:33.</i>
<b>In days of yore.</b> Since the world was created, it entered My thought, as it is stated, ”For [Gehinnom] is arranged from days of yore; that too was prepared for the king.”<sup>14</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshayohu 31:9.</i> This refers to Sancheiriv, who was burned in the fire of Gehinnom, as it is stated, ”The word of Adonoy, Who has fire in Tzion.”<sup>15</sup><i class="footnote">קצרי יד is an expression meaning “lack of power,” as in Bamidbar 11:23, “Is the power of AD limited [= תקצר’ ה היד].”</i>

### passuk 26
<b>Their inhabitants were short of strength.</b> Those whom I weakened before you,<sup>16</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it is a Divine gift for which Sancheiriv could claim no credit.</i> and the might is not yours.<sup>17</sup><i class="footnote">The nations that Sancheiriv conquered had already been condemned to punishment and destruction.</i> You are not mighty, rather they are weak.<sup>18</sup><i class="footnote">In Tehilim 129:6 the verse states” … like the grass on rooftops which even before it is plucked, withers.”</i>
<b>Like grass of the rooftops.</b> Which dries quickly.<sup>19</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, grass is unable to move and defend itself from being cut.—Ralbag</i>

<b>My ring.</b> A kind of ring by which they pull an animal whose behavior is bad,<sup>21</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, חח is a fish hook which pierces the fish when it is pulled out of the water.—Radak</i> as we learned, ”And all animals that are usually pulled with a ring may go out [on Shabbos] with a ring.”<sup>22</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Shabbos 51b.</i>
<b>And my bit.</b> [Targum] Yonoson rendered זמם, which is made of iron, and which is inserted into the nostrils of a female camel,<sup>23</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, מתג is the bit placed in the animal's mouth by which to lead it.—Radak</i> and she is pulled with it, because her behavior is bad. This is what we learned, ”And the female camel [may go out on Shabbos] with a nose ring.”<sup>24</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Shabbos 51b.</i>

### passuk 29
<b>And this shall be the sign for you.</b> The prophet said to Chizkiyohu, ”And this prophecy which I said to you that Sancheiriv will fall here, will be a sign for you<sup>25</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, the sign for the fulfillment of the prophecy is that Sancheiriv will return to his land, mentioned in v. 7 above. The fulfillment of this prophecy serves as a sign that the remainder of the prophecy will likewise be fulfilled.—Radak</i> also for the approaching days, for you are afraid of dying from hunger, because Sancheiriv destroyed the land and chopped down the trees.”
<b>This year you will eat what grows by itself.</b> This year plants will grow for you, and you will be sustained by them.
<b>What grows from the tree stumps.</b> The chopped off trees that will sprout, and when you see My word fulfilled concerning the fall of the armies, it will be a sign for you that this promise, too, will be fulfilled.

### passuk 30

<b>The zeal of Adonoy of Hosts.</b> That He will be zealous for His honor and for His Name, not that you have any merit,<sup>26</sup><i class="footnote">For even the merit of the Patriarchs had been used up, according to Rashi in Yeshayohu 37:32.</i> for Achaz your father committed many wicked deeds.

### passuk 32
<b>He will not advance upon it.</b> He will not set a shield before it.<sup>27</sup><i class="footnote">The first soldiers attacking a city were the shield bearers.—Radak</i>
<b>A ramp.</b> A heap of earth to raise a mount upon which to stand to wage war against the city, and because one presses it down and beats it with sticks and sledge hammers, so that it becomes trodden and pressed down with strength, it is called סוללה, an expression of, “Beat down [=סולו], beat down [=סולו] the highway.”<sup>28</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshayohu 62:10.

<b>And it was that night.</b> When Sancheiriv returned from [battling] with Cush, and he came as far as Nov, which was near Yerusholayim.<sup>29</sup><i class="footnote">Although his astrologers told him that he would be successful in conquering Yerusholayim if he were to attack it on that very day, Sancheiriv in his arrogance decided to camp overnight in Nov and wait for the following day. This ultimately led to his downfall. See Maseches Sanhedrin 95a. Dovid who was Chizkiyohu's ancestor, incurred guilt by causing the deaths of the <i>kohanim</i> of Nov, and it was therefore decreed that his descendants would be liable for punishment for many years. This was the last day of the decree, as stated in Yeshayohu 10:32, “Yet today he will stand in Nov.”</i>
<b>One hundred eighty-five thousand.</b> All of them were heads of companies.<sup>30</sup><i class="footnote">Sancheiriv's camp was enormous. Each of these 185,000 officers was in charge of 2,000 men. See Rashi above, in 18:24.</i>

### passuk 37
<b>In the temple of Nisroch his god.</b> A board from Noach's ark.<sup>31</sup><i class="footnote">נסרת is a contraction of נסר מתיבתו של נח.</i> <sup>32</sup><i class="footnote">Sancheiriv believed it was the deity which saved Noach from the Flood, so it will save him also. See Maseches Sanhedrin 96a.</i>
<b>They do not fear Adonoy.</b> A complete fear as is the custom of the [Bnei] Yisroel. And although they converted out of fear of the lions, [nonetheless,] their fear of Adonoy was not a complete fear, (like [Bnei] Yisroel's custom) as it goes on to elaborate, that they were not engaged in Torah [study] and [in performing] the commandments which God commanded the Bnei Yaakov, and they do not practice according to their statutes and according to their law, which they are obligated to practice once they converted, but as the priest who was of the people of Shomron, instructed them.<sup>37</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, the verse refers to the exiled Bnei Yisroel who “until this day” have not repented from the idolatrous practices, but continue to combine the worship of God with the worship of idols as they had practiced in Shomron.—Radak</i>—who were idolatrous.
