### passuk 1
Dead flies make the ointment of the perfumer fetid and putrid; So doth a little folly outweigh wisdom and honour.

### passuk 2
A wise man’s understanding is at his right hand; but a fool’s understanding at his left.

### passuk 3
Yea also, when a fool walketh by the way, his understanding faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool.

### passuk 4
If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for gentleness allayeth great offences.

### passuk 5
There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, like an error which proceedeth from a ruler:

### passuk 6
Folly is set on great heights, and the rich sit in low place.

### passuk 7
I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth.

### passuk 8
He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh through a fence, a serpent shall bite him.

### passuk 9
Whoso quarrieth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth wood is endangered thereby.

### passuk 10
If the iron be blunt, and one do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength; but wisdom is profitable to direct.

### passuk 11
If the serpent bite before it is charmed, then the charmer hath no advantage.

### passuk 12
The words of a wise man’s mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.

### passuk 13
The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness; and the end of his talk is grievous madness.

### passuk 14
A fool also multiplieth words; yet man knoweth not what shall be; And that which shall be after him, Who can tell him?

### passuk 15
The labour of fools wearieth every one of them, for he knoweth not how to go to the city.

### passuk 16
Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a boy, And thy princes feast in the morning! .

### passuk 17
Happy art thou, O land, when thy king is a free man, And thy princes eat in due season, In strength, and not in drunkenness!

### passuk 18
By slothfulness the rafters sink in; And through idleness of the hands the house leaketh.

### passuk 19
A feast is made for laughter, And wine maketh glad the life; And money answereth all things.

### passuk 20
Curse not the king, no, not in thy thought, And curse not the rich in thy bedchamber; For a bird of the air shall carry the voice, And that which hath wings shall tell the matter.
