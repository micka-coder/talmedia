### passuk 1
<b>For everything there is a season.</b> Let not one who accumulates possessions out of vanity rejoice, for although he possesses them now, they will ultimately pass on to the righteous, only the time has not yet arrived, for everything has a set time<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">The word עת [=time] is repeated 29 times in this section, corresponding to the number of days in a lunar month. </i> when it will be.<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., nothing is coincidental, rather there is a specific time for everything (Metsudas Dovid). Alternatively, one should not say that he has no time for Torah study or the performance of Mitzvos, because in reality לכל זמן, there is time for everything when, ועת לכל חפץ, if it is for an activity that he really desires [=חפץ], there is always time. (Kehilas Yaakov) </i> 
<b>For everything.</b> For every thing [=חֵפֶץ. All things דְּבָרִים are called “חֲפָצִים” in the language of the Mishnah.

### passuk 2
<b>A time to be born.</b> At nine months.
<b>And a time to die.</b> The limit of the years of each generation.
<b>A time to plant.</b> A nation and a kingdom.
<b>And a time to uproot.</b> A time will come for it to be uprooted.

### passuk 3
<b>A time to kill.</b> An entire nation, when the day of its visitation comes, as it is stated, “and he will slay your remnant [with the sword].”<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshayahu 14:30. </i> 
<b>And a time to heal.</b> Their ruin, as the matter is stated concerning Egypt, “and they will repent to Hachem, and He will accept their prayer and heal them.”<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshayahu 19:22. </i> 
<b>A time to wreck.</b> The wall of the city, when it is decreed upon it, as it is stated, “and the wall of Yerusholayim is breached.”<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote">Nechemyah 1:3. </i> 
<b>And a time to build.</b> As it is stated, “and I will build it up as in the days of old.”<sup>6</sup><i class="footnote">Amos 9:11. </i> 

### passuk 4
<b>A time to weep.</b> On the ninth of [Menachem] Av.
<b>And a time to laugh.</b> In the time to come, as it is stated, “Then our mouth will be filled with laughter.”<sup>7</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim 126:2. </i> 
<b>A time to mourn.</b> In the days of mourning.
<b>And a time to dance.</b> With bridegrooms and brides.<sup>8</sup><i class="footnote">The Gra explains the reason why this verse does not have parallel structure, i.e., why is does not state עת לספוד ועת לרקוד, i.e., with a lamed as in the beginning עת לבכות ועת לשחוק. He says that it hints to the halachah stated in Maseches Kesuvos 17a, that on two occasions one interrupts his Torah study [= למד], lamed, to attend a wedding [רקוד] or to attend a funeral [ספוד]. </i> 

### passuk 5
<b>A time to cast away stones.</b> The youths of Yisroel scattered during the destruction of the Beis [Hamikdosh], as it is stated, “sacred gems are scattered.”<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote">Eichah 4:1. </i> 
<b>And a time to gather them</b> from the exile, as it is stated, “And Hachem their God will save His people like sheep on that day, for the stones of the crown will be exalted over His land.”<sup>10</sup><i class="footnote">Zecharyah 9:16. </i> 
<b>A time to embrace.</b> [As it is stated,] “For, just as a belt is fastened, etc.”<sup>11</sup><i class="footnote">Yirmiyahu 13:11. </i> 
<b>And a time to refrain from embracing.</b> [As it is stated,] “And Hachem will drive the people far away.”<sup>12</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshayahu 6:12. </i> 

### passuk 6
<b>A time to seek.</b> As the matter is stated, “I will seek the lost,”<sup>13</sup><i class="footnote">Yechezkeil 34:16. </i> concerning the scattered among Yisroel. 
<b>And a time to abandon.</b> And a time when He causes them to perish in the exile, as it is stated, “And you will become lost among the nations.”<sup>14</sup><i class="footnote">Vayikra 26:38. </i> 
<b>A time to preserve.</b> [As it is stated,] “May Hachem bless you and safeguard you,”<sup>15</sup><i class="footnote">Bamidbar 6:24. </i> when you do His will.

<b>And a time to sew.</b> [As it is stated,] “And they will become united in your hand;”<sup>19</sup><i class="footnote">Yechezkeil 37:17. </i> [and] “neither shall they be divided any longer into two kingdoms.”<sup>20</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. Verse 22. </i> 
<b>A time to be silent.</b> These are the times when a person is silent and receives a reward,<sup>21</sup><i class="footnote">E.g., when a person is insulted and yet remains silent. (Metsudas Dovid) </i> as it is stated, “and Aharon was silent,”<sup>22</sup><i class="footnote">Vayikra 10:3. </i> and he [therefore] merited that the Divine speech addressed him personally, as it is stated, “And Hachem spoke to Aharon, [saying] ‘Do not drink intoxicating wine.’”<sup>23</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. Verse 8. </i> 
<b>And a time to speak.</b> [As it is stated,] “Then Moshe sang,”<sup>24</sup><i class="footnote">Shemos 15:1. </i> [and,] “And Devorah sang,”<sup>25</sup><i class="footnote">Shoftim 5:1. </i> [and,] “Take words with you.”<sup>26</sup><i class="footnote">Hoshei’a 14:3. </i>

<b>And a time to hate.</b> [As] it is stated, “All their evil is in Gilgal; for there I hated them.”<sup>28</sup><i class="footnote">Hoshei’a 9:15. </i> 

### passuk 9
<b>What benefit [then] has the worker.</b> What is the benefit of the one who does evil, in all that he labors? He too, his time will come, and all [his ill gotten gains] will be lost. 

### passuk 10
<b>The matter.</b> The behavior.
<b>To be afflicted.</b> To behave.

### passuk 11
<b>Beautiful in its time.</b> In its proper time, it is beautiful that reward be given for good deeds, but at the time of evil, it is appropriate for meting out punishment for evil deeds.<sup>29</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, “beautiful in its time,” refers to God’s provision of sustenance to all in a timely fashion (Sforno). Or, everything He made is “beautiful when used in its designated time.” (Metsudas Dovid) </i> Even [a sense of] the external world 
<b>He has set in their heart, etc.</b> Also the wisdom of the world that He instilled into the hearts of mankind, He did not instill it all into each one’s heart, rather a little to this one and a little to that one, in order that man should not fully grasp the workings of the Holy One, Blessed Is He, to know it; [and thereby] he will not know the day of his visitation [death] and on what he will stumble, in order that he put his heart to repent, so that he will be concerned and say [to himself], “Today or tomorrow I will die.” Therefore, ‘הָעֹלָם’ is written here defectively [i.e., without a ‘<i>vav</i>’], an expression of “hidden,” for if man knew that the day of his death was near, he would neither build a house nor plant a vineyard.<sup>30</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, “העלם” means eternity and the verse is translated as “even a sense of eternity [העלם] He has set in their heart, etc.” and therefore they act as if they will live forever. (Ibn Ezra) </i> Therefore, he says that, “He has made everything beautiful in its time.” The fact that there is a time for death is a beautiful thing, for a person optimistically says [to himself], “Perhaps my death is far off,” and he builds a house and plants a vineyard; and it is beautiful that it is concealed from people.<sup>31</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, העלם is referring to forgetfulness. </i> 

### passuk 12
<b>I know.</b> Now, since the time of visitation [death] is concealed, that there is nothing better for man than to rejoice with his portion and to do that which is good in his Creator’s eyes, while he is yet alive. 

### passuk 13
<b>And enjoys the good.</b> The Torah and the commandments.

### passuk 14
<b>I know that whatever [God] does.</b> The Holy One, Blessed Is He, in the Creation, is fit to be eternal, and it cannot be changed, either by adding or by subtracting, and when it is changed, [it is because] God commanded and caused it to be changed, in order that they should fear Him. The ocean broke through its boundary in the generation of Enosh and inundated a third of the world, and God did this so that they would fear Him. Seven days, the course of the sun was changed in the generation of the flood, to rise in the west and set in the east, in order that they fear Him. [Also,] the sun went back ten degrees in the days of Chizkiyahu; and in the days of Achaz his father, the day was shortened and the night was lengthened on the day of his death, so that he should not be eulogized. All this was so that they would fear Him.<sup>32</sup><i class="footnote">See the Gemara in Maseches Shabbos 31b which states that God created His world only that men should fear Him, i.e., that they should have awe and reverence for Him. </i> Therefore, there is nothing better for a man to occupy himself with than with [fulfilling] His commandments and to fear Him. 

### passuk 15
<b>That which already was.</b> That which was before us, was already done, and we either saw it or heard it from others who saw it, and we can attest to it, for we saw that the Holy One, Blessed Is He, seeks the pursued. Yaakov was pursued, Eisav was a pursuer, [and Scripture states,] “And I loved Yaakov. But I hated Eisav.”<sup>33</sup><i class="footnote">Malachi 1:1-2. </i> The Egyptians pursued Yisroel; the Egyptians drowned in the sea, and [Bnei] Yisroel were victorious. 
<b>And that which is.</b> Destined to be at the end is a model of what already was. As it was in the beginning, so will it be at the end. The Holy One, Blessed Is He, does not change His standards [by which He sustains] the world. 
<b>And God seeks the pursued.</b> To punish the pursuer. Therefore, what benefit is derived by one who does evil in what he labors? Ultimately he will have to pay [for it]. 

### passuk 16
<b>In the place of justice, etc.</b> I saw with the Holy Spirit, the place of the Chamber of Hewn Stone in Yerusholayim, which was, “full of justice,”<sup>34</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshayahu 1:21. </i> there they judge wickedly, as it is stated, “Her leaders judge for bribes,”<sup>35</sup><i class="footnote">Michah 3:11. </i> and I saw their punishment. 
<b>And in the place of righteousness.</b> The middle gate, which was the place where laws were established. 
<b>There was wickedness.</b> There sat Sarsachim, the chief captain, Nergal Saretzer, the chief officer, and Nevuchadnetzar and his armies,<sup>36</sup><i class="footnote">See Yirmiyahu 39:3. </i> and they judged Yisroel with harsh tortures and death sentences. 
<b>There was wickedness.</b> The accent mark is above [i.e., before the last syllable], indicating that it is a noun like [the preceding] ‘הָרֶשַׁע [wickedness].’<sup>37</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, הרשע is “the wicked person.” (Targum) </i> (It should have been vowelized with a <i>segol</i> under the <i>resh</i>, but since it is at the end of the verse, it is changed to be vowelized with a <i>kamatz gadol</i>, although we do not find another instance [of this word]<sup>38</sup><i class="footnote">But we do find instances of other words that change, as in Shemos 21:24, it states “פצע תחת פצע [=a wound for a wound],” the pei of the first “פצע” is vowelized with a <i>segol</i>, and the pei of the second פצע is vowelized with a kamatz because of the <i>esnachta</i>. (<i>Sifsei Chachomim</i>) </i> where it changes in the case of an <i>esnachta</i> or a <i>sof pasuk</i>). 

### passuk 17
<b>I said in my heart, etc.</b> Therefore, I say everything is judged by the Holy One, Blessed Is He, in due time, and even though the matter [appears] delayed, it will eventually reach its time, for there is a time for everything, even for retribution and for the visitation of judgement there is a time that comes. 
<b>And for every deed that man did, they will judge him there when the time of the visitation arrives; there at that time, a time is given for every deed, to be judged for it.</b> At the gate of the fold there are words, but in the stall are there is strict accounting.<sup>39</sup><i class="footnote">See Maseches Shabbos 32a. The shepherd waits until the goats are by the gate of the fold, and then he rebukes and punishes them. </i> 

### passuk 18
<b>I said to myself.</b> When I observed all this.
<b>Concerning the state of man.</b> Who adopted the trait of haughtiness, to exert rulership and superiority over those smaller than they. 
<b>[God] has set them apart.</b> (Other texts: <b>[God] should clarify for them.</b>) The Holy One, Blessed Is He, to notify them that their rulership is nought, and to show them and also the princes and the kings — 
<b>They themselves are as beast.</b> Like other beasts and animals they are to themselves.

### passuk 19
<b>For the fate of men, etc.</b> This is the reason for the matter, that the Holy One, Blessed Is He, gave a fate and a mishap to mankind, and there is a fate and a mishap to the beasts, and He gave one fate to them both, for just as this one dies, so does that one die. 
<b>And the superiority of man over beast is nil.</b> And the superiority and the success of man over beast is not apparent after he dies, for everything is converted to nothingness by returning to the dust.<sup>40</sup><i class="footnote">This is true when a person spends his life only in the accumulation of wealth. (Metsudas Dovid) </i> 

### passuk 20

### passuk 21
<b>Who knows.</b> As in, “Whoever knows, let him repent,”<sup>41</sup><i class="footnote">Yoel 2:14. </i> [i.e., he] who understands, knows that “the spirit of man” ascends on high and stands in judgment, “and the spirit of the beast” descends to the earth, and does not have to give a justification and reckoning.<sup>42</sup><i class="footnote">However, there are a very few who understand and know this distinction which differentiates the spirit of man from beast. (Metsudas Dovid) </i> [Therefore,] one must not behave like a beast which does not [have to] care about its deeds. 

### passuk 22
<b>I perceived.</b> In all of these.
<b>That there is nothing better.</b> For man.
<b>That man should rejoice in his work.</b> He should rejoice and eat in the toil of his hands, but not to widen his desire like the grave, to covet riches, to accumulate that which is not rightfully his. 
<b>For that is his lot.</b> The toil of his hands, that is the portion given him from Heaven, and with it he should rejoice. 
<b>For who will bring him to see.</b> After he dies, what his children will have; if they, too, will be successful with the wealth that he accumulated and left over for them, or whether they will not prosper.<sup>43</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, for who will bring him to see the reward and punishment after death. </i>
