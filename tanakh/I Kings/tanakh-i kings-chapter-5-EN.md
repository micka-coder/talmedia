### passuk 3

Barley also and straw for the horses and swift steeds brought they unto the place where it should be, every man according to his charge.

### passuk 9

### passuk 10
And Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east, and all the wisdom of Egypt.

### passuk 12
And he spoke three thousand proverbs; and his songs were a thousand and five.

### passuk 14
And there came of all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom.

### passuk 15
And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father; for Hiram was ever a lover of David.

### passuk 16
And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying:

### passuk 17
‘Thou knowest how that David my father could not build a house for the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of my feet.

### passuk 18
But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side; there is neither adversary, nor evil occurrence.

### passuk 19
And, behold, I purpose to build a house for the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spoke unto David my father, saying: Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build the house for My name.

### passuk 20
Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar-trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants; and I will give thee hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt say; for thou knowest that there is not among us any that hath skill to hew timber like unto the Zidonians.’

### passuk 21
And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said: ‘Blessed be the LORD this day, who hath given unto David a wise son over this great people.’

### passuk 22
And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying: ‘I have heard that which thou hast sent unto me; I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of cypress.

### passuk 23
My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea; and I will make them into rafts to go by sea unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be broken up there, and thou shalt receive them; and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.’

### passuk 24
So Hiram gave Solomon timber of cedar and timber of cypress according to all his desire.

### passuk 25
And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of beaten oil; thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.

### passuk 29
And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bore burdens, and fourscore thousand that were hewers in the mountains;

### passuk 30
besides Solomon’s chief officers that were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, who bore rule over the people that wrought in the work.

### passuk 31
And the king commanded, and they quarried great stones, costly stones, to lay the foundation of the house with hewn stone.
