### passuk 1
<b>As for me, in the first year of Darius the Mede</b> when the kingdom of Babylon fell, and the rule of Media and Persia commenced, and the princes of Media and Persia entreated the Omnipresent to make the yoke of their frightful rule heavy upon you, I, Gabriel, stood as a supporter and as a stronghold for Michael, your prince.

### passuk 2
<b>Behold three more kings</b> Our Sages of blessed memory in Seder Olam (ch. 28) said: “This refers to Cyrus, Ahasuerus, and Darius who rebuilt the Temple. Now what is the meaning of fourth’? The fourth, counting from Media.” In the book of Joseph Ben Gorion, however, it is written that Cyrus had a son who succeeded him before the reign of Ahasuerus, named Cambyses.
<b>and when he becomes strong</b> i.e., Darius.
<b>with his wealth, he will arouse</b> his entire kingdom to wage war against the kingdom of the heathens.

### passuk 3
<b>And a mighty king will arise</b> in Greece, viz. Alexander of Macedon.
<b>and do according to his will</b> with Darius the king of Persia, and he will slay him and receive his kingdom, and the Persians will be enslaved by the heathens [the Greeks.

### passuk 4
<b>And when he arises, his kingdom will be broken</b> When he becomes very strong and reaches the height of his strength, his kingdom will be broken, meaning that he will die.
<b>and it will be divided to the four directions of the heavens</b> It is written in the book of Ben Gorion (ch. 14) that he divided his kingdom between the four heads of his family; they are the four heads of the leopard that Daniel saw (above 7:6): “And behold another one, like a leopard, and it had four wings of a bird on its back, and the beast had four heads.” He gave this one dominion in the east, this one in the west, this one in the north and this one in the south, and so in the first vision (8:8): “an appearance of four sprouted in its stead,” concerning the horns of the he-goat.
<b>but not to his posterity</b> The dominion will not come to his sons but to his family members. [The word] אַחֲרִיתוֹ coincides only with the expression of sons, and so Scripture states (Amos 4:2): “and you shall be borne on shields and your posterity (אַחֲרִיתְכֶן) in fishing boats,” which Jonathan renders: and your sons (sic) and daughters in fishermen’s boats.
<b>and not like the dominion that he ruled</b> but the kingdom of these will not be as strong as that of Alexander.
<b>for his kingdom will be uprooted</b> to divide to these four heads and to others besides these.

<b>will be surrendered</b> into the hands of the king of the north, <b>she and those who brought her, and he who begot her</b>, i.e., her father.

### passuk 7
<b>A scion of her roots will arise</b> a son sitting on his position, on the throne of the kingdom.
<b>and he will come to the army</b> to the king of the north.
<b>into the stronghold of the king of the north</b> i.e., in the cities of his strength, in his fortresses.
<b>and he will succeed in them</b> Heb. וְעָשָׂה בָהֶם, lit. and he will succeed against them.
<b>and take hold</b> and he will conquer them.

### passuk 8
<b>their princes</b> [as translated,] their princes.

### passuk 9
<b>And he will come into the kingdom of the king of the south</b> Through the kingdom of the king of the south, who was her father’s father, he will return to his land, which is Egypt, as is stated above: “will bring in captivity to Egypt.”

### passuk 10
<b>And his sons</b> [i.e., the sons] of the king of the north will agitate.
<b>and he will come</b> Heb. וּבָא בוֹא, like וְהוֹלֵךְ הָלוֹךְ. The son of the king of the north will come and pass to the land of the south.

<b>and he will fell myriads</b> many of the army of the king of the south.
<b>but he will not prevail</b> Nevertheless, the victory of the war will not be his.

### passuk 13

### passuk 14
<b>and the sons of the renegades of your people will exalt themselves to bring about the vision</b> I saw in the name of Rav Saadia Gaon that they were the renegades of Israel and their company.

### passuk 15
<b>and the people of his chosen ones</b> will be in the war.
<b>will have no strength to stand</b> before the king of the north, and although there is a superfluous “vav” here, it is customary for Scripture to speak in this manner as in, for example: “As for its nobles, there are none (וְאֵין) who proclaim the kingdom,” Isaiah (34:12).

### passuk 16
<b>will do</b> The king of the north, who comes to the king of the south, [will do] as he wishes.

<b>And he will set his face</b> i.e., the king of the north, to come into the strength of the entire kingdom of the king of the south.

<b>and he will succeed</b> Heb. וְעָשָׂה, lit. and he will do.
<b>Now the daughter of the women he will give him to destroy her</b> This is the nation of Israel, [referred to in Song of Songs 1:8 as] “the fairest of women.” The king of the north will command the general of his army to destroy her. I say that he is Antiochus, the king of Greece, who issued decrees against Israel, and he commanded his general, Phillip, to kill whoever identified himself as a Jew, as is written in the book of Josiphon (ch. 18).
<b>but it will not stand</b> this counsel of his.
<b>and she will not be for him</b> the daughter of the women, for Mattathias the son of Johanan will rise and break off his [Antiochus’s] yoke from Israel.

### passuk 18
<b>and the Prince will terminate his blasphemy to Him</b> His reproach and his blasphemy, with which he blasphemed the Holy One, blessed be He, and Israel, as is written in the book of Josiphon (ch. 20), and He punished him, for He smote him with evil boils while he was in transit, for he went to besiege Jerusalem, and his flesh became putrid, his limbs fell off and he ordered his slaves to bring him back to Antioch, but he did not manage to get there before he died of evil illnesses.

### passuk 19
<b>to the strongholds of his land</b> to return to his fortified city.

### passuk 20
<b>And one who removes the oppressor will stand on his base</b> and Mattathias the son of Johanan, who removed the oppressor from Israel, and who is the glory of the kingdom of Israel, will strengthen himself on his base on Mt.

<b>in a few days it will be broken</b> In a few days, their kingdom will be broken.
<b>but not with anger</b> of another nation.
<b>and not with war</b> but from themselves and with themselves, that Hyrcanus and Aristobulus will be jealous over the throne.

### passuk 21
<b>And a contemptible person will stand on his base</b> Then the kingdom of Rome will strengthen itself on its stand, as it says (Obad. 1:2): “you are very despised,” and the Romans will rise and take the kingdom from the Greeks.

<b>and also the king with whom they made a covenant</b> Also the king of Israel, who will form a treaty with them, will ultimately be inundated from before him, for [the Romans] will violate the treaty and betray them, as our Sages of blessed memory said: “Twenty-six years they kept their trust with Israel, but later they subjugated them.”

### passuk 23
<b>And from the alliance with him he will work deceitfully</b> And from the alliance that Rome will make with Israel, he will work deceitfully, for he will not reveal his evil plan.
<b>and he will go up</b> from his place.
<b>and overpower</b> in all places around the land of Judea: in Edom, in Ammon, and in Moab.
<b>with few people</b> He will not require a massive army, for the king of Judea will aid him, and so it is written in the book of Josiphon (ch. 23).

### passuk 24
<b>plunder and spoils and belongings he will distribute to them</b> He will distribute to those who accept their yoke upon themselves until they conquer all with flattery and smooth speech.
<b>will distribute</b> Heb. יִבְזוֹר, like יִפְזוֹר. and so (Ps. 68:31): “he scatters (בִּזַר) peoples.”
<b>and about the fortresses</b> of the nations he will devise in his plans—to station [in them] the heads of his troops until the time that all will be conquered under them.

### passuk 25
<b>and he will not stand</b> the king of the south.
<b>because they will devise plans against him</b> They will plot against him to fell him through the bribery that they will bribe his officers to betray him, as he concludes: “and those who eat his food will break him.”

<b>and on one table</b> They will murmur lies about the kingdom of Aristobulus.
<b>but it will not succeed</b> for Israel will not be surrendered to destruction in those days.

<b>and he will return and contemplate those who abandoned the holy covenant</b> He will put his mind to it and contemplate that Israel has abandoned the holy covenant (and law), and unwarranted hatred and controversy will increase in the Second Temple [era], as is written in the book of Josiphon (ch. 45), and they will shed innocent blood, and he will rely on this and know that he will succeed, and he will abrogate his treaty with them and provoke them.

<b>and they will profane</b> the stronghold of the Temple.

### passuk 32
