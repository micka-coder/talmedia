<b>And the princes of Judah heard</b> that the false prophets and the priests had seized Jeremiah.
<b>at the entrance of the new gate of the Lord</b> Others annotated: When Jehoiachin went in exile and some of the vessels of the house of our God went with him, Nebuchadnezzar’s army breached the eastern gate, and Zedekiah subsequently repaired it and renewed it. It is therefore called ‘new.’

<b>but we are doing great harm to ourselves</b> if we kill him.

### passuk 20
<b>Also a man was prophesying</b> The one who said this did not say this. I.e., those who related the incident of Micah did not relate the incident concerning Uriah. Up to here are the words of the righteous. Now the wicked who were there arose and said, “Also a man was prophesying, etc.” Just as Uriah was killed, so shall Jeremiah be killed. In this way it is explained in Sifrei (Num. 11:7).
