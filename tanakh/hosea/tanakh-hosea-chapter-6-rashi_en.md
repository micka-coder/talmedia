<b>Because</b> Heb. עַל-כֵּן. Like עַל אֲשֶׁר, because of that which. Comp. (Gen. 33:10) “Because (כִּי עַל-כֵּן) I saw your face”; (ibid. 27:36) “because (כִּי עַל-כֵּן) I did not give her to Shelah my son.”

### passuk 8
<b>who lurk to shed blood</b> Heb. עֲקֻבָּה. Full of people who lurk to murder. Comp. (Jos. 8:13) “and their lyers in wait (עֲקֵבוֹ)”; (Gen. 27:36) “and he deceived me (וַיַּעְקְבֵנִי).”

### passuk 9
<b>And as a man gathers fish, so do bands</b> Heb. וּכְחַכֵּי. And as a fisherman gathers fish, who gathers them with a fishhook together, so do bands gather. Companies of their priests, who gather to go on the road, will all murder there in one group.
<b>for they devised a plot</b> For this is a plot which they plotted prior to their gathering, to which place they would go to murder and to loot. וּכְחַכֵּי means ajjmedours in O.F, fishermen. And also in mishnaic Hebrew, חַכֵּי is an expression of joining. The Gemara states (Baba Kamma 119b): “And he shall not put into it more than three חַכִּין.” Those are the stitches with which the comber joins together both ends of the garment when he beats it with sticks. This [following] interpretation is mine, and it seems appropriate, and this is the explanation: And when there is a group of five men gathering together, it is a company of priests to murder. The first one is that of Rabbi Meir Sheliach Zibbur o.b.m.
<b>in one group</b> Heb. שֶׁכְמָה, an expression of one group.

### passuk 10

<b>appointed</b> Heb. שָׁת. The appointer appointed a time for retribution for her.

<b>harvest</b> The time of her leaving and her exile. Comp. “A little more time and the time of harvest shall come to her,” in reference to the retribution of Babylon, in the Book of Jeremiah (51:33).
<b>the backsliding of My people</b> Heb. שְׁבוּת, an expression of the straying of youth and childhood, anwejjsdoure in O.F. Comp. (Jer. 3:14) “backsliding children (שוֹבָבִים)”; (ibid. 31:21) “backsliding daughter (הַבַּת הַשׁוֹבֵבָה).”
