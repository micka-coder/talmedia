### passuk 7
And the sons of Cush: Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabteca; and the sons of Raamah: Sheba, and Dedan.

### passuk 8
And Cush begot Nimrod; he began to be a mighty one in the earth.

He was a mighty hunter before the LORD; wherefore it is said: ‘Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before the LORD.’

### passuk 10
And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.

### passuk 11
Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and Rehoboth-ir, and Calah,

and Resen between Nineveh and Calah—the same is the great city.

### passuk 13
And Mizraim begot Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,

### passuk 17
and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite;

### passuk 18
and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite; and afterward were the families of the Canaanite spread abroad.

### passuk 19
And the border of the Canaanite was from Zidon, as thou goest toward Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest toward Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, unto Lasha.

And the sons of Aram: Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.

### passuk 24
And Arpachshad begot Shelah; and Shelah begot Eber.

### passuk 25
And unto Eber were born two sons; the name of the one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother’s name was Joktan.

### passuk 26
And Joktan begot Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah;

### passuk 27
and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah;

### passuk 28
and Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba;
