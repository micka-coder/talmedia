<b>To be powerful.</b> [He was mighty] in causing the entire world to rebel against God by means of his plan for the <i>Haflagah</i> generation.

### passuk 9
<b>A mighty hunter.</b> He ensnared the minds of people with his words and misled them to rebel against God. 
<b>Before Hachem.</b> [Meaning:] he intentionally provoked Him to His Face.
<b>It is therefore said.</b> About any person who sins brazenly, knowing [who] his Master [is] and, yet, purposely rebelling against Him. [About such a person] it is said, “This one is like Nimrod, a mighty hunter.”

<b>[From] that land, etc.</b> As soon as Asshur saw that his children were obeying Nimrod and rebelling against God by building the Tower [of Bavel], he left their midst. 

### passuk 12
<b>The great city.</b> This refers to Nineveh, as it is said, “Nineveh was a tremendously large city to God.”

<b>[Also] the Pasrusim, and the Kasluchim from whom came the Plishtim.</b> They descended from both of them. For the Pasrusim and the Kasluchim would exchange wives with each other and the Plishtim [Philistines] descended from them.

<b>The borders of the Canaanites.</b> [Means:] the end of his land. Wherever גְּבוּל appears in Scripture it means “end” or “extremity.”
<b>Toward.</b> It is a noun. To me it seems [that it is an expression:] as when one person says to another, “This boundary extends until <i>you come</i> to such and such a place.” 

### passuk 20
<b>According to their families, and their languages. </b> Though they had different languages and lands, [nevertheless,] they are all descendants of Cham. 

### passuk 21
<b>Father of the Children of the Other Side...</b> of the river, was Sheim. 
<b>Brother of Yefes, the elder.</b> I cannot tell who is the older, Yefes or Sheim. When it states, “Sheim was 100 years old, etc. two years after the Flood” you must conclude that Yefes was the older, because Noach was 500 years old when he had his first child and the Flood was in 600th year of Noach’s [life.] Consequently, his oldest child was 100 years old, and Sheim did not reach [the age of] 100 years until two years after the flood. 
<b>The brother of Yefes.</b> [It does] not [state] that he was Cham’s brother because the former two honored their father, whereas, the latter degraded him.

<b>Dispersed.</b> The languages became confused and they were scattered from the plain and they were dispersed over the whole world. We may learn [from this] that Eiver was a prophet because he named his son for [an event that would happen in] the future. [In support of this view] we have learned in Seder Olam that it was towards the end of his [Eiver’s] life that they became dispersed. For if you claim that it was early in his life, [how can you reconcile the following?] Yokton, his younger brother, had propagated many families before this, as it is written “Yokton produced, etc.” [Only] <i>afterward</i> [does it state:] “The whole earth had, etc.” And if you will claim that [the dispersion took place] in his mid-life, [then I would counter:] Scripture does not come to obfuscate, but to clarify. Hence, you may conclude that in the year of Peleg’s death they were dispersed. 
<b>Yaktan.</b> Because he was humble and thought little of himself he, therefore, merited to establish all these families.
