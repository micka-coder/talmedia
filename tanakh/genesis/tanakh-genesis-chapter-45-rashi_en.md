<b>Yossef could not contain his emotions in the presence of all who stood.</b> He could not bear that the Egyptians standing by him would hear his brothers’ humiliation when he would make himself known to them.

### passuk 2
<b>And the house of Pharaoh heard.</b> [בֵּית פַּרְעֹה is the same as] בֵּיתוֹ שֶׁל פַּרְעֹה i.e., his servants and his household. Here, the reference is not to a literal house but, rather, is similar to בֵּית יִשְׂרָאֵל —the household of Israel, or בֵּית יְהוּדָה —the household of Yehudah, <i>meisnede</i> in O.F. 

### passuk 3
<b>They were shocked at his presence.</b> Out of shame.

### passuk 4
<b>Please come close to me.</b> He saw them recoiling backwards so he thought: “Now, my brothers feel ashamed,” so he called to them tenderly and pleadingly and showed them that he was circumcised. 

### passuk 5

### passuk 10

### passuk 11
<b>Lest you become impoverished.</b> דִּלְמָא תִּתְמַסְכֵּן —lest you become impoverished [Onkelos]. From the same root as מוֹרִישׁ וּמַעֲשִׁיר .

### passuk 12
<b>Behold, your eyes see—</b> my glory, and that I am your brother for I am circumcised as you are and, furthermore, “That I speaks to you” in the Holy Language [Hebrew]. 
<b>Along with my brother Binyomin’s eyes.</b> He mentions them all alike to imply: “Just as I have no animosity toward my brother Binyomin, for he was not there when I was sold, so, too, I have no animosity in my heart toward you.” 

### passuk 13

### passuk 14
<b>He fell upon his brother Binyomin and wept.</b> [He wept] for the two Temples which were destined to be in Binyomin’s territory and, in the end, will be destroyed. 
<b>And Binyomin wept upon his neck.</b> For the Tabernacle of Shiloh which was destined to be in Yossef’s territory and in the end will be destroyed. 

### passuk 15
<b>After that.</b> After they saw him weeping and his intentions toward them were peaceful—<b>[After that] his brothers spoke with him.</b> Because at first they felt shame before him.

### passuk 16
<b>The news was heard in Pharaoh’s house.</b> [בֵּית פַּרְעֹה is] the same as בְּבֵית פַּרְעֹה —in Pharaoh’s house, and here it [בַּיִת —house] is meant literally. 

### passuk 17
<b>Load up your beasts.</b> With grain.

### passuk 18
<b>The best of the Land of Egypt.</b> [Referring to] the Land of Goshen. [Here] he prophesied without realizing it because it would ultimately become like the depths of the sea which contains no fish.
<b>The fat of the land.</b> חֵלֶב always means the best part of something.

### passuk 19
<b>Now you are commanded—</b> Through me to tell them—
<b>To do the following.</b> Tell them that it is with my permission.

### passuk 20

### passuk 21

### passuk 22

### passuk 23
<b>He sent the following.</b> [Meaning:] according to this amount. And what was the amount? “Ten male donkeys, etc.” 
<b>The best of Egypt.</b> We find in the Talmud that he sent him aged wine from which old people derive pleasure. [However, in the] Midrash Aggadah [we find that it was] pounded beans. 
<b>Grain, bread.</b> As Onkelos translates it. 
<b>And food.</b> Things that are eaten with bread.

### passuk 24
<b>Do not be troubled along the way.</b> Do not become involved in halachic discussion so that the road not become a menace to you. An alternate explanation: Do not take very large steps and arrive [at your evening stop] while there is still daylight. As for the plain meaning of the verse, it can be said that, because they were embarrassed, he was worried lest they quarrel on the way concerning his being sold, to dispute with one another by saying, “It was because of you that he was sold” [or,] “You are the one who told slanderous things about him, and caused us to hate him.” 

### passuk 25

### passuk 26
<b>He is ruler.</b> [וְכִי is used as וַאֲשֶׁר]—<i>that </i> he is ruler.
<b>His heart stood still.</b> [וַיָפָג לִבּוֹ means:] his heart changed and he ceased believing. His heart was not swayed by their words. In Mishnaic Hebrew we find it as מְפִיגִין טַעְמָן . This is similar to “Without ceasing” or [for example] וְרֵיחוֹ לֹא נָמָר is translated וְרֵיחֵיהּ לָא פָג —“His scent has not ceased.”

### passuk 27
<b>All the words of Yossef.</b> He [Yossef] gave them as a sign—the subject that he was studying at the time that he left him [Yaakov]— the topic of עֶגְלָה עֲרוּפָה —the heifer whose neck is broken. This is [alluded to by] what is said: “And he saw the wagons [עֲגָלוֹת] that Yossef had sent.” and it does not state, “Which Pharaoh had sent.” 
<b>The spirit of Yaakov was revived.</b> The Divine Presence, which had left him, rested on him. 

### passuk 28
<b>It is too much.</b> Much joy and pleasure is still in store for me since my son Yossef, is alive.
