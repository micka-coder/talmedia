<b>He called Rachel and Leah.</b> First Rachel and then Leah, for she [Rachel] was the principal wife because it was for her that Yaakov accepted to be related to Lavan. Even Leah’s descendants admit to this for Boaz and his court who were of Yehudah’s tribe say, “Like Rachel and like Leah, who both built, etc.,” placing Rachel ahead of Leah.

<b>The Almighty of Beis Eil.</b> The same as אֵל בֵּית אֵל the letter ה"א being superfluous. It is usual for Scripture to speak this way as in “For you are coming to [הָאָרֶץ] the Land of Canaan. 
<b>Where you anointed.</b> Meaning distinction and greatness similar to the anointing of a king. Similarly: “And he poured oil on top of it,” so that it be anointed as an altar. 
<b>You made a vow to Me.</b> And you must fulfill it, for you said that it shall be a House of God, [implying] that you will offer sacrifices there. 

### passuk 14

### passuk 15

### passuk 23
<b>His brothers.</b> [Meaning:] his kinsmen.
<b>A distance of seven days.</b> The entire three days that it took the messenger to [reach and] tell Lavan, Yaakov continued on his journey. Consequently, Yaakov was six-days’ distance from Lavan. And on the seventh [day] Lavan overtook him. We [can, therefore,] infer that the entire distance that Yaakov traveled in seven days Lavan traveled in one day (as it is said: “He pursued him a distance of seven days,” and it does not say, he pursued him for seven days.)

<b>And came into Rachel’s tent.</b> When he left Leah’s tent he returned to Rachel’s tent before searching the tent of the two handmaidens. Why [did he bother doing] all this [in Rachel’s tent]? Because he knew her to be one who touches everything.

<b>Rams of your flocks.</b> From here they [the Sages] derive that [even] a one-day-old ram is called אַיִל because, otherwise, why would this be praiseworthy; [did he mean to say that] he had not eaten rams but lambs he had eaten? If this were the case, then he would be a thief. 

### passuk 39
<b>A mutilated animal.</b> [Mutilated] by a lion or wolf.
<b>I will take the blame for it.</b> Having the same meaning as [יַחֲטִא in the verse]: “Sling stones at a hair’s breadth without missing” [יַחֲטִא] [or:] “I and my son, Shlomo, shall be losers,” [חֲטָאִים] [חֲטָאִים meaning] missing. [Yaakov, in effect was saying:] “I will suffer its loss. If it be missing then I will be the one missing it because you may demand it from me.” 
<b>I will take the blame for it.</b> Onkelos translates it: דַּהֲוַת שָׁגְיָא מִמִּנְיָנָא . [Meaning] that which is lacking and missing, as in, “Not one person is missing from us” which Onkelos translates וְלָא שְׁגָא [there was not missing].

### passuk 42
<b>And the fear of Yitzchak.</b> He did not wish to say אֱלֹהֵי יִצְחָק because God does not associate His Name with the righteous while they are alive. Although He said to him [Yaakov] when he left Beer Sheva: “I am Hachem, the God of Avraham, your father, And God of Yitzchak,” because his [Yitzchak’s] eyesight had dimmed and he was therefore considered as dead. [Nevertheless] Yaakov was afraid to say אֱלֹהֵי and [instead] said וּפַחַד . 
<b>And He reprimanded you.</b> A term meaning reproof and not a term meaning to determine.
