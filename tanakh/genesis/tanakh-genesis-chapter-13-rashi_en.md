### passuk 1
<b>Avram went up . . . into the south.</b> [Meaning:] to arrive at the south of Eretz Yisrael, as it was stated above, “traveling steadily southward,” [meaning:] to Mount Moriah. Nevertheless, when one travels from Egypt to the Land of Canaan, he travels from south to north, for Egypt is south of Eretz Yisrael as can be shown by the “journeys” and at the boundaries of Eretz Yisrael. 

### passuk 2
<b>Very wealthy.</b> [I.e.,] he was laden with baggage. 

### passuk 3
<b>He continued on his travels.</b> [This indicates] that when he returned from Egypt to the Land of Canaan he went and lodged in those inns in which he had lodged on his way to Egypt. This teaches that good manners [require] that a person not change his place of lodging. Another explanation: On his return trip he paid the debts he incurred.
<b>From the south.</b> [Meaning] from Egypt [and it is called מִנֶּגֶב because] [it is] south of the Land of Canaan.

### passuk 4
<b>Which he made there at first, and he called.</b> <i>And</i> where “Avram called in the Name of Hashem.” It can also be taken to mean, that “He <i>now</i> called there in the Name of Hashem.” 

### passuk 5
<b>Who accompanied Avram.</b> What brought this about? The fact that he traveled with Avram.

### passuk 6
<b>[It] was unable to support them.</b> [Meaning] It could not provide [enough] pasture for their cattle. The phrase is abbreviated and an additional [word] is needed: “The <i>pasture</i> of the land could not support them.” The text, therefore, reads וְלֹא נָשָׂא in the masculine form. 

### passuk 7
<b>There was a quarrel.</b> Because Lot’s shepherds were wicked and grazed their animals in others’ fields. [When] Avram’s shepherds admonished them for [committing] robbery, they responded: “The land was given to Avram who has no heir. Lot, his nephew, is his heir and, [therefore,] this does not constitute robbery.” But, the verse states: “The Canaanites and Perizzites were then living in the land,” so that Avram did not yet possess it. 

### passuk 8
<b>We are kinsmen.</b> [Here meaning:] relatives. The Midrashic explanation is: they had similar facial features.

### passuk 9
<b>If [you go] to the left, I [will go] to the right.</b> [Meaning:] wherever you may settle I will not go far from you and I will stand by you [to serve] as a shield and as a help. In the end he, indeed, needed him as it is said, “When Avram heard that his kinsman was taken captive.” 
<b>I [will go] to the right.</b> [Meaning:] “I will direct myself towards the right,” just as וְאַשְׂמְאִילָה [means] “I will direct myself towards the left.” If you may ask that it should have been vocalized וְאַיְמִינָה [you may be answered that] we find similarly in another place [in Scripture]: “Can one direct himself to the right?” and it is not vocalized לְהַיְמִין . 

### passuk 10
<b>That it was abundantly watered.</b> A land of water streams.
<b>Before Hachem destroyed Sedom and Amorah.</b> That plain was . . . 
<b>like Hachem’s garden</b> for [the growing of] trees . . .
<b>like the Land of Egypt</b> for [growing] grain and vegetables.
<b>Going toward Zoar.</b> [Meaning:] until Zoar. The Midrashic interpretation explains it disparagingly. It was because they were permeated with immorality that Lot chose their locality.

### passuk 11
<b>Plain.</b> [Means] “plain” as the Targum translates.
<b>From the east.</b> He departed from Avram and traveled to the west of Avram, consequently traveling from east to west. The Midrashic interpretation is; he removed himself from the One Who precedes the world, saying, “I want neither Avram nor his God.” 

### passuk 12
<b>Setting up his tents.</b> [Meaning:] he pitched tents for his shepherds and for his cattle as far as Sedom.

### passuk 13
<b>The people of Sedom were wicked.</b> And yet Lot did not refrain from residing with them. Our Sages learned from here: “The names of the wicked shall rot.”
<b>Wicked.</b> With their persons.
<b>Sinful.</b> With their wealth. 
<b>Towards Hashem, exceedingly.</b> They know their Master and intentionally rebel against Him. 

### passuk 14
<b>After Lot had separated.</b> As long as the wicked person was with him, the Word [of God] withdrew from him. (And above when Lot was [still] with him and [yet] it is written: “And God appeared to Avram,” [we must assume that] at that time he [Lot] was [still righteous]). 

### passuk 15

### passuk 16
<b>So that if a man can.</b> Just as it is impossible for dust to be counted so, too, your progeny will not be counted. 

### passuk 17

### passuk 18
<b>Mamrei.</b> The name of a person.
