### passuk 1
And the man knew Eve his wife; and she conceived and bore Cain, and said: ‘I have agotten a man with the help of the LORD.’

### passuk 2
And again she bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.

### passuk 3
And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.

### passuk 4
And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering;

### passuk 5
but unto Cain and to his offering He had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.

### passuk 6
And the LORD said unto Cain: ‘Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?

### passuk 7
If thou doest well, shall it not be lifted up? and if thou doest not well, sin coucheth at the door; and unto thee is its desire, but thou mayest rule over it.’

### passuk 8
And Cain spoke unto Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.

### passuk 9
And the LORD said unto Cain: ‘Where is Abel thy brother?’ And he said: ‘I know not; am I my brother’s keeper?’

### passuk 10
And He said: ‘What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto Me from the ground.

### passuk 11
And now cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand.

### passuk 12
When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth.’

### passuk 13
And Cain said unto the LORD: ‘My punishment is greater than I can bear.

### passuk 14
Behold, Thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the land; and from Thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth; and it will come to pass, that whosoever findeth me will slay me.’

### passuk 15
And the LORD said unto him: ‘Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold.’ And the LORD set a sign for Cain, lest any finding him should smite him.

### passuk 16
And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.

### passuk 17
And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bore Enoch; and he builded a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch.

### passuk 18
And unto Enoch was born Irad; and Irad begot Mehujael; and Mehujael begot Methushael; and Methushael begot Lamech.

### passuk 19
And Lamech took unto him two wives; the name of one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.

### passuk 20
And Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of such as dwell in tents and have cattle.

### passuk 21
And his brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe.

### passuk 22
And Zillah, she also bore Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron; and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.

### passuk 23
And Lamech said unto his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; Ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech; For I have slain a man for wounding me, And a young man for bruising me;

### passuk 24
If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, Truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.

### passuk 25
And Adam knew his wife again; and she bore a son, and called his name Seth: ‘for God hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel; for Cain slew him.’

### passuk 26
And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh; then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.
