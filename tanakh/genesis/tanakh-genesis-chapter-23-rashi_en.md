<b>The lifetime of Sarah consisted of one hundred years, twenty years and seven years.</b> The reason the word שָׁנָה [year] is written with every set is to tell you that every set is to be explained by itself. [When she was] 100 years old she was like a 20 year old, regarding sin. Just as when she was 20 she was not considered as having sinned since she was not yet subject to punishment, so, too, at 100 she had not sinned. And when she was 20 she was like a seven-year-old, regarding [her] beauty. 
<b>The years of Sarah’s life.</b> [This tells us] that they were all equally good.

<b>Avraham came.</b> From Beer Sheva.
<b>To eulogize Sarah and to weep for her.</b> The narrative of Sarah’s death immediately follows the <i>Akeidah</i> [binding] of Yitzchak because as a result of the news of the <i>Akeidah,</i> that her son had been prepared for slaughter and almost not been slaughtered, her soul departed from her and she died.
