### passuk 1
<b>I am Almighty Shaddai.</b> [Meaning:] “I am the One Whose Godliness suffices for every creature. Therefore, walk before Me and I will be your God and Protector.” Similarly, wherever it appears in Scripture its explanation is thus: “He is sufficient.” However, it also depends on the context. 
<b>Walk before me.</b> As he [Onkelos] translates: “Worship Me.” Cling to My worship. 
<b>And be perfect.</b> This, too, is an imperative following an imperative, [i.e.,] “Be perfect in all the tests.” According to its Midrash: “Walk before Me” refers to the precept of circumcision and as a result of this you will become perfect. For as long as you are uncircumcised, I consider you imperfect. Another explanation of וֶהְיֵה תָמִים : Now you are lacking [control over] five organs; two eyes, two ears, and the membrum; by adding one letter to your name the numerical value of the letters [of your name] will be two hundred and forty-eight corresponding to the number of your organs. 

### passuk 2
<b>I will give My covenant.</b> [This refers to] the covenant of love and the covenant for you to possess the land by [your fulfilling] this precept.

### passuk 3
<b>Avram fell on his face.</b> From fear of the Divine Presence. Because prior to being circumcised he did not have the strength to stand while the Divine Presence stood over him. It is [to this reference] that it is stated concerning Bilam, “Fallen down and eyes open.” I found this in the Beraisa of R. Eliezer. 

### passuk 4

### passuk 5
<b>For the father of a multitude of nations.</b> This is an acrostic of his name. The letter רי"ש which was originally in [his name] signifying that he was a father only to Aram which was his [original] country, whereas, now he was a father to the entire world and even the letter רי"ש , originally in his name, was, [nevertheless], not removed from its place. For even the letter יו"ד of Sarai’s name had complained to the Divine Presence until it was added to Yehoshua’s name as it is said: “Moshe called Hoshea bin Nun [by the name] Yehoshua. 

### passuk 6
<b>And I will make you into nations.</b> [Referring to:] Israel and Edom. For he had already had Yishmael and He would not be revealing tidings concerning him.

### passuk 7
<b>I will sustain My covenant.</b> And what is this covenant? To be a God to you.

### passuk 8
<b>As an eternal possession.</b> It is <i>there</i> that I will be a God to you. But, one who resides outside Eretz Yisrael is like someone who has no God. 

### passuk 9
<b>And as for you.</b> The letter וי"ו [וְאַתָּה] here [denotes] a continuation of the previous matter: [i.e.] “As for Me, here is My covenant with you,” <i>and</i> you take heed to keep it. And by what means shall it be kept? “This is My covenant which you must preserve, . . . you shall be circumcised.” 

### passuk 10
<b>Between Me and you.</b> [Referring to:] those who are now alive.
<b>And your descendants after you.</b> [Referring to:] those who are destined to be born.
<b>Be circumcised.</b> As if [it were written] לְהִמוֹל [to circumcise] as you might say עֲשׂוֹת in place of לַעֲשׂוֹת [to do].

### passuk 11
<b>You shall circumcise.</b> [וּנְמַלְתֶּם] has the same meaning as וּמַלְתֶּם and the letter נו"ן is an addition that periodically appears in it, as the letter נו"ן in נוֹשֵׁךְ and the letter נו"ן in נוֹשֵׂא . וּנְמַלְתֶּם has the same form as וּנְשָׂאתֶם But, the word יִמוֹל is the form יִפָּעֵל , as in יֵעָשֶׂה [shall be done], [or] יֵאָכֵל [shall be eaten]. 

### passuk 12
<b>House-born.</b> [Meaning:] to whom a maidservant gave birth in [your] house.
<b>Bought with money.</b> [Referring to:] one who was bought after birth.

### passuk 13
<b>Your house-born slaves must be circumcised.</b> Here [the circumcision of יְלִיד בַּיִת] is repeated and it does not say, “On the eighth day” [as in v. 12], in order to teach you that there is a יְלִיד בַּיִת that is circumcised after eight days as is explained in Meseches Shabbos. 

### passuk 14
<b>An uncircumcised male.</b> Here it teaches that circumcision [is performed] in that place where there is a distinction between male and female.
<b>Who will not circumcise.</b> [This applies to] one who has reached the age of [being liable to] punishment and then he shall be excised. However, his father [who fails to circumcise him] is not punished for it by being excised, but is guilty of transgressing a positive precept. 
<b>That soul shall be cut off.</b> He will go childless and die before his time.

### passuk 15
<b>Do not call her by the name Sarai.</b> שָׂרַי implies “<i>my</i> princess” but not to others. But, her name will be Sarah—in a general sense for she will be a princess [שָׂרָה] to everyone. 

### passuk 16
<b>I will bless her.</b> What is this blessing? It is that she reverted to her youthfulness, as it is said: “Now that I am worn out, shall I have the pleasure [of a son].” 
<b>I will bless her.</b> The ability to breastfeed, when she needed this [ability] on the day of Yitzchak’s feast when people were maliciously saying of them that they took in a foundling from the street. They, [however,] said, “He is our child.” So each woman brought her child— but neglected to bring its nursemaid— and she nursed them all. This is what is said: “Sarah has nursed the children.” Ber. Rab. partially alludes to this. 

### passuk 17
<b>Avraham fell on his face and laughed.</b> This one [the word וַיִּצְחָק] Onkelos translates, happiness and rejoicing, whereas [the word וַתִּצְחַק] concerning Sarah he interprets as laughter. You may learn [from this] that Avraham believed [the prophecy] and rejoiced but Sarah did not believe, and ridiculed. That is why God was angry with Sarah but was not angry with Avraham. 
<b>Can, etc.</b> There are expressions of astonishment that [mean to] affirm [what was said] as in “Did I reveal myself?” [or] “Do you see?” Here, too, it is an affirmation, and this is what he thought to himself: “Would this favor be done to another that which God is doing for me?” 
<b>Shall Sarah, who is ninety.</b> Is she worthy of giving birth? Though the earlier generations gave birth [even] at the age of 500, in the days of Avraham, life was already shorter and a waning of strength had set in the world. Go and learn this from the ten generations between Noach and Avraham who gave birth at the [relatively] early age of 60-70. 

### passuk 18
<b>May it be granted that Yishmael live.</b> If only Yishmael might live. [Meaning:] “I am unworthy to receive such a reward.” 
<b>Live before You.</b> [Meaning:] that he live in fear of You, as in “Walk before Me,” [which Onkelos translates:] “Worship Me.” 

### passuk 19
<b>Indeed.</b> An expression of affirmation. Similarly: “Truly, we are sinners.” [Or] “Truly, she has no son.” 
<b>And you will name him Yitzchak.</b> Based on the laughter. Some say, based on the [י'] 10 trials and [צ'] for 90 years of Sarah[’s age] and [ח'] for the 8th day when he was circumcised and [ק'] for the 100 years of Avraham’s age. 
<b>I will establish My covenant with him.</b> Why is this said? It has already been written “And as for you, you must preserve My covenant, you and your descendants.” But, since He said, “I will establish, etc,” I might think that the descendants of Yishmael and the descendants of Keturoh are included in the establishment [of the covenant]. It is, therefore, said: “I will establish My covenant <i>with him</i> and not with others. [If so, why is the verse] “My covenant I shall establish with Yitzchak” [again] stated? To teach that he was holy from the womb. Another explanation [for repeating v. 19]: R. Abba said, From here the son of the mistress drew a logical conclusion from the maidservant’s son: It is written, “I have blessed him and I will make him fruitful and will increase him.” This refers to Yishmael. How much more so. . . will I establish My covenant with Yitzchak. 
<b>My covenant.</b> That the Covenant of Circumcision will be transmitted [only] to the descendants of Yitzchak.

### passuk 20
<b>Twelve princes.</b> [A reference to the fact] they will dissipate like clouds, as in: “Clouds [נְשִׂיאִים] and wind.” 

### passuk 21

### passuk 22
<b>From [above] Avraham.</b> This is a more fitting expression when referring to the Divine Presence and we also learn that the righteous are the vehicles of God [’s Presence].

### passuk 23
<b>Very day.</b> On the <i>same day</i> that he was commanded, by <i>day</i> and not by night. He was not afraid of the idolaters or of the scoffers. And so that his enemies and contemporaries not claim: “Had we seen him we would not have let him do the circumcision and fulfill God’s precept.” 
<b>And he circumcised.</b> This is the וַיִּפְעַל form.

### passuk 24
<b>When he was circumcised.</b> In the בְּהִפָּעֲלוֹ form the same [form] as בְּהִבָּרְאָם —“when they were created.

### passuk 25
<b>When he circumcised the flesh of his foreskin.</b> Concerning Avraham it does not state אֵת , because he only lacked cutting the flesh, for [the membrane] had already dissolved. But, Yishmael who was a lad required [actual] cutting the foreskin and tearing open the corona membrane. Therefore, concerning him אֵת is said. 

### passuk 26
<b>On that very day.</b> [On the day] that Avraham turned ninety-nine and Yishmael thirteen years, Avraham and his son Yishmael were circumcised.
