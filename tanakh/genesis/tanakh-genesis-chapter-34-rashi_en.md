<b>The daughter of Leah.</b> [Why is she] not [called] “the daughter of Yaakov”? But, because of her “going out” she is called “the daughter of Leah” because she [Leah] too, was in the habit of “going out,” as it is said, “And Leah went out to meet him.” (She is the source of the adage: “Like mother like daughter.”)

<b>And we will take your daughters for ourselves.</b> You will note that in the proposal that Chamor made to Yaakov, as well as in the response of Yaakov’s sons to Chamor, they regarded Yaakov’s sons as the important ones in that they could select the daughters of Shechem according to their choice, and give their daughters as they saw fit, as it is written, “We will give our daughters”—as we see fit. “And we will take your daughters,” whichever we see fit. Whereas, when Chamor, and his son, Shechem, spoke to the inhabitants of their city they reversed the words, [saying:] “We will take their daughters as wives and give them our daughters. [They did this] in order to convince them to consent to be circumcised.
