Concerning Nevuchadnezzar it is said: וַתִּתְפָּעֶם רוּחוֹ [with a double ת']—“He was agitated” This is because in that case [of Nevuchadnezzar] there were <i>two</i> agitations; his forgetting the dream and not knowing its interpretation.
<b>The wizards of.</b> [חַרְטֻמֵי is a contraction of] הַנֵּחָרִים בְּטִימֵי מֵתִים —[i.e.,] they inquire of the bones [of the dead]. טִימֵי means bones in Aramaic. It appears in the Mishnah: “A house מָלֵא טִימַיָּא ,” [meaning:] full of bones.

### passuk 13
<b>He restored me to my position.</b> [He refers to] Pharaoh, who is mentioned earlier, as it is said: “Pharaoh was enraged at his servants.” The verse is in abbreviated form for it does not specify who it was that restored, because there is no need to specify who it is that restored—[for it is obvious that] it was whoever has in his power to restore, namely, Pharaoh. This is usual with all abbreviated verses—when it deals with who has the power to do the matter is left indefinite. 

### passuk 14
<b>Out of the Dungeon.</b> From the prison [literally, from the pit so called] because it was made as a sort of pit. Similarly, anytime בּוֹר appears in Scripture, it means pit. Even if it does not contain water it is called בּוֹר , <i>fose</i> in O.F.

<b>Seven years, and seven years.</b> Together they total only seven [years]. The reason for the dream being repeated twice is because the thing is imminent, as he explained to him afterwards: “As for the dream being repeated, etc.” Concerning the seven good years it states: “He [God] has told Pharaoh,” because it was about to happen; whereas, concerning the seven hunger years it states: “He [God] has revealed to Pharaoh” because the thing was distant and far-off, where the proper term is מַרְאֶה —showing.

<b>All the food.</b> [The word אֹכֶל] is a noun. Consequently, the accent is on the אל"ף and [the כ"ף] is vocalized with a <i>patach koton</i>. The word אוֹכֵל , when it is a verb, e.g., “For whoever will eat [אוֹכֵל] fat,” has its accent on the latter syllable, on the כ"ף and is vocalized with a <i>kametz koton</i>. 
<b>Under the hand [jurisdiction] of Pharaoh.</b> [Meaning:] in his control and in his storehouses.

### passuk 36

### passuk 41
<b>I have placed you in charge.</b> [Onkelos translates it:] מַנֵּיתִי יָתָךְ —I have appointed you. Nevertheless, it has the meaning of giving, as in: “And to make you high.” Whether in reference to raising to a high position or whether in reference to degrading the term נְתִינָה is appropriate, as in: “I have made you humiliated and degraded.” 

### passuk 42
<b>Pharaoh then took off his ring.</b> The giving of the king’s ring is a sign for the one to whom it is given that he is to be second in command to him.
<b>Linen garments.</b> Considered very prestigious in Egypt.
<b>A [gold] chain.</b> [רְבִיד means] a chain. Because it is made up of consecutive rings it is called רְבִיד —a chain. Similarly: “I have bedecked my bed,” [meaning] “I have covered my bed with rows of rugs.” In Mishnaic terms we find: “Surrounded with rows of stone.” [Also:] “On the rows of stones in the Temple Court, [רוֹבֵד] refers to the floor [רִצְפָּה].

<b>Avreich.</b> As Onkelos translates it: דֵּין אַבָּא לְמַלְכָּא —This is the associate of the king. In Aramaic רֵךְ means king. [In the Talmudic chapter] “Hashutfin” [we find:] “Not a king, nor the son of a king.” In the Aggadah R. Yehudah explained it: אַבְרֵךְ refers to Yossef [אַב —old, רַךְ —young] who was “old” in wisdom and “young” in years. Ben Durmaskis said to him, “How much longer will you continue to misinterpret Scripture?” אַבְרֵךְ can only be related to the word בִּרְכַּים [knees], because all would enter before him and leave, only with his permission, similar to what is said: “He thus placed him,” etc. 

### passuk 44
<b>I am Pharaoh.</b> Who has the power in his hands to issue decrees over my kingdom, and I hereby decree that no man shall lift his hand—<b>Without you.</b> [Meaning:] without your permission. Another explanation [of the words] “I am Pharaoh” [meaning:] “I will be king, but without you, etc. This [explanation] is similar to: “Only by [virtue of] the throne [will I be greater than you].” 
<b>His hand or his foot.</b> [Should be explained] as Onkelos translates it.

### passuk 45
<b>Tzafnas Paneiach.</b> [Meaning:] the explainer of hidden things. The word פַּעְנֵחַ has no parallel in Scripture.
<b>Poti Phera.</b> He is Potiphar and was [now] called Poti Phera as a result of becoming castrated, because he had lusted to sodomize Yossef. 

### passuk 46

### passuk 47
<b>The earth produced.</b> Should be explained as Onkelos translates it. Yet the word [וַתַּעַשׂ] does not lose its meaning of doing, making. 
<b>By handfuls.</b> They stored up fist over fist, hand over hand. 

### passuk 48
<b>The food of the fields surrounding each city was placed within [the city].</b> Because every area preserves its produce and they [therefore] put among the grain some of the earth from the place [where it grew] which preserves the grain from decaying.

### passuk 49

<b>When all the land of Egypt was famished.</b> For, all the grain that they stored rotted except for that of Yossef. 
<b>Whatever he says to you, do</b> Because Yossef had told them to be circumcised. When they came to Pharaoh and told him, “This is what he is telling us [to do],” he said to them, “Why did you not store up grain? Did he not announce to you that the famine years were coming?” They replied, “We gathered much but, it rotted.” He said to them, “In that case, whatever he says to you, do! for he put a decree on the grain and it rotted, what if he puts a decree on us and we die?” 

### passuk 56
<b>Over the entire face of the land.</b> Who are referred to as פְּנֵי הָאָרֶץ ? The wealthy people.
<b>Everything that held grain.</b> As Onkelos translates it: in which there was grain.
<b>And sold [grain] to the Egyptians.</b> שֶׁבֶר is a term used for [either] selling and buying. Here it is used in the sense of selling, [whereas שִׁבְרוּ] “Buy a little food for us,” is used in the sense of buying. Do not think [that it is a word used] only in regard to [buying and selling] grain, because we find it also in regard to wine and milk: “And go buy, without money or price, wine and milk.” 

### passuk 57
<b>All [countries] of the land came to Egypt.</b> To Yossef to buy. Because if you explain it in the order in which it is written, it should have said: to buy <i>from</i> Yossef.
