But the non-Jew complains and says, “a house [i.e., Beis Hamikdosh], whose fame reaches to the ends of the world, I have exhausted myself on many roads, and have come and prayed in it and found no substance in it, just as there is no substance in idol worship.” Therefore, “according to all that the stranger calls out to You,”<sup>28</sup><i class="footnote">Above v. 39.</i> but a Jew, if You see that he uses his wealth to destroy his friend, do not give him.

<b>The inside of the Courtyard.</b> These words are to be taken literally, according to Rabbi Yehudah; [i.e.,] he hallowed the floor of the court with the [same] sanctity of the Altar, [enabling one] to offer sacrifices on the floor.<sup>33</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, משפט means “needs,” and the translation of the verse is, “to provide the needs of His servant and the needs of His people.”—Metzudas Tzion</i>

Therefore Shlomo’s [altar] was 576 times as large as Moshe’s.<sup>36</sup><i class="footnote">I Melochim 3:4.</i> If so, what is the meaning of,  “the king sanctified the middle of the Courtyard?” [It means] that he set the stone altar into it, firmly connected to the floor.<sup>37</sup><i class="footnote">See Maseches Zevochim 59b.</i>
