<b>But he was not warmed.</b> Our Rabbis said, “He who disgraces clothing will ultimately be deprived of their pleasures.”<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Berachos 62b.</i> [Dovid’s clothing did not warm him] because he tore off the corner of Shaul’s robe.<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">See I Shmuel 24:5.</i> The Midrash [Aggadah states], Rabbi Shmuel son of Nachmeni said, that as Dovid saw the angel standing in Yerusholayim with his sword drawn in his hand, his blood became cold from fear.<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">That terror of that experience remained with Dovid, and from then on he could never again find warmth.</i>

### passuk 2
<b>Virgin girl.</b> Her virginity warms her flesh.
<b>A warmer.</b> “A warmer,”<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">Koheles 10:9.</i> and similarly, “and he who chops wood will be warmed [יסכן] by them.”<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, סכנת means that she should be “near” to him.—Targum</i>

### passuk 3

### passuk 4
<b>Was not intimate with her.</b> Because a virgin is more suitable for [the purpose] of warming than a non-virgin.<sup>6</sup><i class="footnote">He therefore preferred that she remain a virgin.</i> But our Rabbis said [he was not intimate with her] because “He shall not have too many wives,”<sup>7</sup><i class="footnote">Devarim 17:17. See Rashi there.</i> and he already had eighteen.<sup>8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., because Dovid already had eighteen wives, the maximum permitted for a king, he therefore did not marry her. See Maseches Sanhedrin 22a and Rashi there.</i>

### passuk 5
<b>Exalted himself.</b> He elevated himself.<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote">The literal meaning is, “lifted himself.”</i>
<b>And fifty men.</b> Whose spleens had been removed, and whose soles of their feet had been carved.<sup>10</sup><i class="footnote">See Maseches Sanhedrin 21b and Rashi there.</i>

### passuk 6
<b>Had never angered him.</b> He did not anger him.<sup>11</sup><i class="footnote">Throughout his life, Dovid had never gotten angry at Adoniyahu or punished him when he did something bad. Adoniyahu therefore incorrectly assumed that his father would not reprimand him for proclaiming himself king.</i> This [episode] teaches you that he who refrains from rebuking his child causes his death.<sup>12</sup><i class="footnote">See Mishlei 13:24.</i>
<b>And he was also very handsome.</b> [He was as handsome] as Avsholom,<sup>13</sup><i class="footnote">“He too,” infers that there was another individual who was also very handsome.</i> about whom it is written, “And as Avsholom there was no one as handsome.”<sup>14</sup><i class="footnote">II Shmuel 14:25.</i> This caused them to be proud.
<b>She gave birth to him.</b> [“She” refers to] his mother.
<b>After Avsholom.</b> I.e., his mother reared him in the same spoiled manner that Avsholom’s mother reared him.<sup>15</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi does not translate “<i>after</i> Avsholom” because it implies that she bore both Adoniyahu and Avsholom, which is not true, for Avsholom’s mother was Ma’acha, and Adoniyahu’s mother was Chagis.</i>

### passuk 7
<b>With Yoav ben Tseruyah.</b> Because he knew that Dovid bore a grudge against him for having killed Avner, Amasa, and Avsholom; and that he would eventually charge his son, who would reign in his place, to deal with him. He [Yoav] therefore wanted that this one [Adoniyahu] should reign through his assistance so that he would favor him.
<b>And with Evyosor the <i>kohein</i>.</b> He was dismissed from the priesthood at the time when Dovid escaped from Yerusholayim on account of Avsholom, when he [Evyosor] consulted the <i>Urim</i> and <i>Tumim</i> and was unsuccessful as it is stated, “And Evyosor went up.”<sup>16</sup><i class="footnote">II Shmuel 15:24.</i> He [Evyosor] was a descendant of Eili. And he knew that he would not serve in the days of Shlomo, for it was stated to Eili, “And I will appoint for Myself a faithful <i>kohein</i>... and he will serve before My anointed one...”<sup>17</sup><i class="footnote">I Shmuel 2:35.</i> He [Evyosor] wanted that this one [Adoniyah become king] through his assistance.<sup>18</sup><i class="footnote">So that Adoniyahu would listen to him when he became king and would restore him to his previous position of Kohein Gadol.</i>

### passuk 8
<b>And Noson the prophet.</b> Who prophesied to Dovid that Shlomo would reign, as it is stated in Divrei Hayomim, “ his name will be Shlomo.”<sup>19</sup><i class="footnote">I Divrei Hayomim 22:9. The verse reads, “Behold a son will be born to you, he will be a man of rest, and I will give him rest from all his enemies around, his name will be Shlomo.”</i>

### passuk 9
<b>And fattened [oxen].</b> Oxen which are [fattened by being] fed forcefully.
<b>The stone of Zocheles.</b> A huge stone used by the young men to test their strength by moving or dragging it. An expression similar to “moving [זוחלין]”<sup>20</sup><i class="footnote">See Misnayoy Mikvaos 5:4,5.</i> water, or, “those that creep [זוחלי] on the earth.”<sup>21</sup><i class="footnote">Devarim 32:24.</i> [Targum] Yonoson rendered [אבן זוחלת as] אבן סכותא [=a lookout stone], upon which people stand and look far into the distance.
<b>Ein-Rogel.</b> [Targum] Yonoson rendered [עין רוגל as] עין קצרא, which is [a well]<sup>22</sup><i class="footnote">It was customary to anoint kings near a well or another source of running water to symbolize continuity and prolonged rule. See Rashi 1:33 below.</i> used by a clothes washer who would press the woolen clothes with his feet [=רגליו], by trampling [on them].

<b>On my personal mule.</b> This will be a sign that he will reign and the beginning of [his] greatness, because a commoner is forbidden to ride on the king’s horse.
<b>To Gichon.</b> [Gichon] is the well of Shilo’ach. From this [episode is derived the custom] not to anoint the kings except at the well, to symbolize thereby that his kingship shall continue on and on.<sup>27</sup><i class="footnote">As the waters of a well do.</i>

### passuk 34

<b>And the archers and the sling shooters.</b> [Targum] Yonoson rendered, “the archers and the sling shooters.”<sup>31</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, כרתי ופלתי refers to the Sanhedrin.—Ralbag</i> But our Rabbis maintained [that it refers to] the <i>Urim</i> and <i>Tumim</i>.<sup>32</sup><i class="footnote">The Urim and Tumim are called “כרתי ופלתי”; כרתי because their words are “cut” [כרת], i.e., they render irrevocable decisions and פלתי because they are “wondrous” [פלא] in revealing the future. See Maseches Berachos 4a.</i>

### passuk 39
<b>The horn of oil.</b> [Tzadok took] of the anointment oil compounded by Moshe.<sup>33</sup><i class="footnote">See Shemos 30, 31.</i>

<b>Of the horns [of the corners] of the Altar.</b> Which was in Givon.<sup>36</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, he grabbed on to the corners of the altar that was in Yerushalayim.—Radak. In those days it was permissible to build an altar and bring certain sacrifices outside of the Mishkan. </i> He said, “Those who are executed by Beis Din are buried in the graves of Beis Din.
