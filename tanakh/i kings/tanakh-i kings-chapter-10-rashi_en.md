<b>And his elevated ramp by which he would go up to the Beis Hamikdosh of Hachem.</b> By means of a passageway that he had prepared from his house to the Beis Hamikdosh, by which he would go up to the House of God.<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, ועולתו אשר יעלה עליו refers to the sacrifices that Shlomo offered in the Beis Hamikdosh, described above in 9:25.—Targum</i>

<b>A pathway to the Beis Hamikdosh of Hachem.</b> But in Divrei Hayomim it is written, “paths [מסילות] to the House of Hachem.”<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">II Divrei Hayomim 9:11.</i> I therefore say, that this support [מסעד] is an expression of a pavement.
<b>For the singers.</b> For the <i>Leviyim</i>.

### passuk 13
<b>Gave to the queen of Sheva.</b> This giving refers only to the teaching of wisdom.
<b>All that she desired.</b> (He had relations with her and Nevuchadnetzar was born, and he later destroyed the Beis [Hamikdosh] that had stood 410 years in the territory of all the twelve tribes. Rabbi Yitzchak [Luria] of blessed memory) [He gave her more,] in addition to giving her gifts and delicacies that are found here but are not found in her place.<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, Shlomo gave her gifts of intellectual wisdom by answering all the problems and questions that she had asked, in addition to solving the riddles that she had posed to him.—Ralbag</i>

### passuk 14
<b>Six hundred sixty-six.</b> Chirom gave him 120 [talents], the Queen of Sheva 120, the ships of Tarshish brought from Ophir 420, totaling 660 [talents]. I do not know from where the other six came. It is written in Divrei Hayomim that [the ships brought] from Ophir 450 [talents],<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">See II Divrei Hayomim 8:18.</i> however it does not include the 120 talents of Chirom. We can resolve the contradictions that the extra 30 were from the 120 of Chirom, because Chirom’s servants were in Ophir with his servants.

### passuk 15
<b>This was in addition [to the gold that came from] traveling merchants.</b> Merchants would bring him who visited the land on business.<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, retailers who sell small quantities, spy [=תרים] out the land to determine where to do business.—Metzudas Tzion</i>
<b>Spice dealers.</b> Spice dealers who would carry spices from one city to another.
<b>And all the subordinate kings.</b> [Targum] Yonoson rendered, “and all dependent upon his support,”<sup>6</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, Arab kings.—Metzudas Tzion</i> an expression of guarantee, [i.e.,] kings who were allies and were dependent upon his support, <i>garantie</i>, in O.F.

<b>Full shields.</b> [A body shield that] encircles the person on three sides. This is the meaning of the verse in the Book of Tehillim, “as a body shield, with good, will You shall surround him.”<sup>7</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim 5:13.</i>
<b>Six hundred.</b> Six <i>manim</i>, for [a piece of] gold is a dinar.

### passuk 17
<b> Soft gold.</b> It is soft and easy to flatten out.<sup>8</sup><i class="footnote">This type of gold can be spun like thread [חוט]. See Maseches Yoma 44b-45a.</i>

<b>Six steps.</b> Steps by which to go up [to it], and the top of the throne, was circular, where the king sits.
<b>From behind.</b> The throne was wide, and the steps were to the front and to the width, to the back was the seat, higher than the throne, was a round place.<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote">A circular dome protruded from above the throne above the king’s head.—Metzudas Dovid</i>
<b>And there were arm-rests on each side.</b> On which to support his arms, like two gold rails from end to end, extending on the right and on the left.
<b>There were two lions.</b> Of gold. The entire plan of the throne is described in the Aggadah of Megillas Esther.<sup>10</sup><i class="footnote">Esther Rabboh 1:12.</i>

<b>Fourteen hundred chariots.</b> But in Divrei Hayomim it states, “seventeen hundred.”<sup>11</sup><i class="footnote">II Divrei Hayomim 1:14. Rashi apparently had a different version of the text than ours. Our text in Divrei Hayomim reads, “fourteen hundred chariots.” Thus there is no discrepancy between the texts.</i> Therefore I say that fourteen hundred were in the chariot cities, and three hundred were with the king in Yerusholayim. And this is the explanation in Divrei Hayomim, “and he stationed them in the chariot cities, and with the king there were other chariots in Yerusholayim.” And while here, this is the explanation, and he stationed them in the chariot cities and with the king; and in Yerusholayim [were additional ones].
<b>He placed them.</b> And he led them.<sup>12</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, he stationed them.—Metzudas Dovid.</i>

### passuk 27
<b>As stones.</b> But above it states, “of no value.”<sup>13</sup><i class="footnote">Above v. 21.</i> Our Rabbis explained that one refers to the time before Shlomo married Pharaoh’s daughter, and one refers to the time after Shlomo wedded Pharaoh’s daughter.<sup>14</sup><i class="footnote">See Maseches Sanhedrin 21b. After Shlomo married Pharaoh’s daughter and began to go astray, the nation became less prosperous and silver regained some value.</i>

### passuk 28
<b>The source of the horses that Shlomo possessed.</b> Was from Egypt.
<b>A privileged cartel.</b> The gathering of horse dealers was in Egypt. Shlomo’s merchants bought [the rights] from the king of Egypt, because no person could export horses from there except through them. This is what I heard. Therefore, there is a “zakef gadol”<sup>15</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a cantillation signifying a pause.</i> on “ומקוה,” to denote that the word מקוה stands by itself and is not connected with what follows it.<sup>16</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, מקוה is linen thread [thread=תקוה, See Yehoshua 2:18], i.e. Egypt exported two items for Shlomo, horses and linen thread—Radak. Or מקוה [=מן קוה], i.e., they brought horses from a region called קוה.—Metzudas Dovid</i>

### passuk 29
<b>And a single horse for one hundred fifty.</b> We deduce that a chariot consisted of four horses.<sup>17</sup><i class="footnote">If a single horse was exported for 150 silver pieces, and a chariot was exported for 600 silver pieces, obviously a chariot consisted of four horses. </i> And for these prices [they sold] to all the kings of the Chitim and Aram.
<b>Through them.</b> Through Shlomo’s merchants, they exported them from Egypt.
