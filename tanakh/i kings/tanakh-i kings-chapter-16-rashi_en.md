<b>Also, in the hand of Yeihu the son of Chanoni the prophet, there was a word of Hachem concerning Bashah.</b> I.e., behold Eilah son of Bashah reigned, nevertheless, the word of Hachem through Yeihu was that his kingdom would not last.<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">This verse is a continuation of Yeihu’s prophecy contained in v.1-4 above, therefore it begins with “Also.”—Metzudas Dovid</i>
<b>And because he had killed him [Nodov].</b> Since he too, committed the same sins, consequently he should not have killed him, therefore he was punished for his murder. And similarly we find, “And I will avenge the blood of Yizre’el upon the house of Yeihu,”<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">Hoshe’a 1:4.</i> because they did not turn away from Achov’s ways, they were punished for his murder.

<b>Nor any of his relatives or friends.</b> [Targum Yonoson rendered, “neither] his kinfolk nor his friends.”<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, “his friend,” singular, meaning his confidant.—Metzudas Dovid</i>

<b>And Tivni died.</b> When Asa took Omri’s daughter in marriage for Yehoshofot his son, they killed Tivni,<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, he died a natural death and thereby Omri ruled undisputedly.—Radak See v. 23 below and Rashi there.</i> when they saw Omri’s prominence; according to Seder Olam.

<b>In the thirty-first year of the reign of Asa, etc., Omri reigned.</b> An undisputed reign. His conflict with Tivni lasted five years, from the twenty-seventh year of Asa[’s reign] until the thirty-first [year].
<b>For twelve years.</b> Was the total [of his reign], five [years] were in conflict and seven [years] his reign was undisputed. It is impossible to say that his reign was undisputed for twelve years, because Achov his son reigned in the thirty-eighth year of Asa[’s reign].
<b>In Tirtzoh he reigned six years.</b> Before he had built Shomron.

<b>And worshiped the [idol] Baal.</b> In addition to Yerovom’s calves.<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote">The Gemara in Maseches Sanhedrin 102b states that Achov’s minor sins were like Yerovom’s major ones. If so, why are Yerovom’s sins emphasized here? Because he opened the way to sin for the Bnei Yisroel.</i>

<b>Chieil of Beis Eil.</b> [I.e.,] Chieil who was from Beis Eil, similar to, “Yishay of Beis Lechem [בית הלחמי],”<sup>7</sup><i class="footnote">I Shmuel 16:1.</i> and it does not state הבית לחמי, and similarly, “Yehoshua of Beis Shemesh [בית השמשי],”<sup>8</sup><i class="footnote">I Shmuel 6:14.</i> in the Book of Shmuel, and [it does] not [state] הבית שמשי, and similarly, “In Ofrah [that belonged to Yoash] of the Avi Ezri [אבי העזרי],”<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote">Shoftim 6:11.</i> and it does not state האבי עזרי. Some interpret בית האלי [is from the word אלה or curse], since he accepted upon himself Yehoshua’s curses, “Cursed [before Hachem] be the man who rises up and rebuilds, etc.”<sup>10</sup><i class="footnote">Yehoshua 6:26. Also, see Maseches Sanhedrin 113a.</i> Our Rabbis stated that Chieil was of [the tribe of] Binyomin, and Yericho belonged to Yehoshofot<sup>11</sup><i class="footnote">Who was of the tribe of Binyomin.</i> [King of Yehudah]. Why does [Scripture] relate him to Achov [King of Yisroel], because a curse is related to a corrupt person.<sup>12</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Yerushalmi Maseches Sanhedrin 10:2. Alternatively, even though Achov witnessed Divine retribution visited upon Chieil, Achov nonetheless did not repent.—Metzudas Dovid.</i> (Other texts: To a cursed person.)
<b>With Avirom his first born he laid the foundation.</b> When he laid its foundation, his firstborn son died, and he buried [him] and continued to bury all his sons until the last one died when he was installing its doors. And, these were Yehoshua’s curses, “With [the loss of] his firstborn shall he lay its foundation, and with [the loss of] his youngest child he will set up its gates.”<sup>13</sup><i class="footnote">Yehoshua 6:26. </i>
