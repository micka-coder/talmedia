<b>In the month of Ziv.</b> This is Iyar because the trees have blossoms. And [Targum] Yonoson translated this similarly, “the bloom of the buds.”
<b>Which is the second month.</b> When numbering the months, because Nissan is the beginning of the year for [counting] months.
<b>Of the reign of Shlomo.</b> Referring to “the fourth year.”<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it does not mean “the second month of Shlomo’s reign,” rather it means the second month of the fourth year of Shlomo’s reign.</i> It was the fourth year of Shlomo’s reign. And similarly it is stated in Divrei Hayomim, “And he began to build in the second month [on the second day] in the fourth year of his reign.”<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">II Divrei Hayomim 3:2.</i>

<b>Sixty <i>amohs</i>.</b> The Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies together.<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">The length of the Sanctuary was 40 <i>amos</i> and the Holy of Holies was 20 <i>amos</i>.</i>

### passuk 3
<b>The entrance hall along the front.</b> In front of the entrance to the Sanctuary. 
<b>[Twenty <i>amohs</i>] long along the front of the width of the Beis Hamikdosh.</b> The length of the entrance hall was along the width of the Sanctuary, from north to south. All larger measurements are referred to as the length, and the lesser are referred to as the width. Since in the Sanctuary, the measurement from east to west was greater,<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">It measured 40 <i>amos</i> versus 20 <i>amos</i> from north to south.</i> it was called the length, but since the entrance hall’s measurement from north to south was greater,<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote">It measured 20 <i>amos</i> versus 10 <i>amos</i> from east to west.</i> [that which is] called the length, [is the measurement] from north to south and [the measurement] from east to west was called the width.
<b>Along the front of the house.</b> Was in front of the house on the eastern side, on the outside.<sup>6</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it was in addition to the 60 <i>amos</i> mentioned in v. 2 above.</i>

### passuk 4
<b>That were open [wide] on the outside and closed [narrow] on the inside.</b> Our Rabbis explained [שקופים] as an expression of looking, an opening, an observation;<sup>7</sup><i class="footnote">It was made of a glass-like substance.—Metzudas Dovid.</i> open on the outside and closed on the inside, narrow on the inside, not in the usual manner of other windows<sup>8</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, חלוני means “sockets” into which שקפים [=“horizontal beams”] were inserted. The sockets were open only on the inside and did not go all the way through the wall, i.e., they were אטומים [=sealed] and not visible from the outside of the building.</i> which are made for illumination,<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote">They are therefore constructed narrow on the outside and widening towards the inside to allow the light to spread out as it enters.</i> to indicate that it was not in need of illumination.<sup>10</sup><i class="footnote">See Maseches Menachos 86b.</i>

### passuk 5
<b>A chamber.</b> <i>Apentec</i>, in O.F. It has three names, יציע' תא' צלע, thus is this explained in [Maseches] Bava Basra.<sup>11</sup><i class="footnote"> 61a.</i> 
<b>Around the walls of the Beis Hamikdosh circling all around.</b> I.e., against the Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies, which is the דביר, he made chambers on the outside at the south, west, and north. And the end of the verse explains its beginning. “He built against the wall of the Beis Hamikdosh, [meaning] near the wall of the Beis Hamikdosh, a chamber round about. How did he make it? “Against the walls of the Beis Hamikdosh, [i.e., against] the Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies, he made chambers.”
<b>And he made.</b> He made. And similarly, “He was [ויהי] my salvation,”<sup>12</sup><i class="footnote">Shemos 15:2.</i> means the same as “He was [היה] my salvation.”<sup>13</sup><i class="footnote">The word ‘יהי’ is in the future tense but the ‘vav’ converts it [="ו" המהפך] to the past tense.</i>

### passuk 6
<b>The bottom chamber.</b> One each side there were three [tiers of] chambers, one on the other. The measurement of its length is not stated here, but in Maseches Midos<sup>14</sup><i class="footnote"> 4:3.</i> we learned that there were thirty-eight chambers, fifteen in the north, five on top of five and five on top of them, and the same was in the south. And eight in the west, three on top of three and two on top of them. The bottom ones were five [<i>amohs</i> wide] and the middle ones six, and the top ones seven. Why? Because he made depressions in the wall of the house round about on the outside. The height of the chamber was five <i>amohs,</i> and as the height of the wall of the Sanctuary reached five <i>amohs,</i> he decreased its thickness and recessed it one <i>amoh</i> inward, and on that recess he placed the ends of the beams of the roof at the top of the chamber which served as the floor of the middle one. And as the wall reached [the height of] ten [<i>amohs</i>], he recessed it [another] <i>amoh</i> to place the ends of the beams of the roof of the middle [chamber] which served as the floor of the upper [chamber]. Thus we find the middle [chamber] is wider than the lower one by one <i>amoh</i>, and the upper [chamber] is wider than the middle one by one <i>amoh</i>.
<b>So that [the beams] would not be attached to the walls of the Beis Hamikdosh.</b> In order that the ends of the beams do not attach [to the walls] through perforations in the walls of the house, since this deteriorates the wall and it diminishes its beauty.

### passuk 7
<b>When [the Beis Hamikdosh] was being constructed it was built of whole stones carried [from the quarry].</b> As it was removed from the mountain, through the worm [=a שמיר],<sup>15</sup><i class="footnote">See Mishnayos Avos 5:6. Radak indicates that Shlomo sent an eagle to bring him the <i>shamir</i> which was in the Garden of Eden.</i> [i.e.,] as it came from there they set it into the wall of the structure,<sup>16</sup><i class="footnote">That is why it is called אבן שלמה [=whole stones], because they were used exactly as they arrived, without being cut or chiseled.</i> and they did not chisel it with any metal tools. And the “stone” mentioned above,<sup>17</sup><i class="footnote"> 5:31.</i> is a controversy in [Maseches] Sotah.<sup>18</sup><i class="footnote"> 48b.</i>
<b>Hammer.</b> <i>Delutta</i>, in Russian.

### passuk 8
<b>The entrance of the bottom chamber was in the right side of the house.</b> [Targum] Yonoson rendered תיכונה as the “bottom,”<sup>19</sup><i class="footnote">It cannot mean the middle story because you would not have an entrance to a building that is one story above ground level.</i> and not as “between” the upper and lower [ones], because the five chambers on the southern side had an opening to the outside in the bottom story. And this (is the meaning) “and by a winding stairway they went up to the middle [chamber].”<sup>20</sup><i class="footnote">Thus indicating that תיכונה was the “bottom” story.</i>
<b>The bottom.</b> [Targum] Yonoson rendered “the middle,” because these chambers were not open to the outside. There were three openings to each. Thus is this taught in Maseches Midos,<sup>21</sup><i class="footnote"> 4:3.</i> “One was to the chamber on the right and one was to the chamber on the left and one to the chamber above.” And it teaches us here that one of the lower [chambers] on the southern wall had an opening to the outside and through that opening<sup>22</sup><i class="footnote">The southern side is called the “right” side, because a person standing inside the Beis Hamikdosh at its entrance and looking out would be facing east and the southern side would be to the right.</i> they entered all the chambers. And the “middle chamber” of the verse, is not the middle one between the upper and the lower [ones], but the middle one of the five chambers on the southern side which had an opening to the outside in the bottom story. And this is the meaning of, “and by a winding stairway they went up to the middle [chamber],” which was above it, signifying that the תיכונה chamber was below.
<b>And by a winding stairway.</b> [Targum] Yonoson rendered, a winding staircase [=מסיבתא], and that is called in our language [O.F.] <i>vis</i>, and in German, <i>vindelstein</i>, and the commonly used name is <i>schvindel stieg</i>. It is a structure of stone pillars made [in the form] of many stairs, and one who goes on them is likened to one spiraling around a column, ascending many <i>amohs</i> on it without needing the inclination of an ordinary ladder, because its spiral serves as its incline.
<b>To the third.</b> [שלישים means the same] as to the third [=שלישיים]

### passuk 9
<b>And [he] covered.</b> An expression of a ceiling covering. 
<b>With decorated boards and connected planks of cedar.</b> [There were] two ceilings, the one made for beauty was below, and the one of cedar planks was above; that of paneling was the lower one. And [Targum] Yonoson rendered [גבים as] בהנתוכין, but I do not know what they are. I heard in the name of Rabbi Menachem, blessed be the memory of the righteous, that they are boards woven beautifully in the form of a design, and it is called in our language [O.F.] <i>celed</i>, and in German, <i>gehimmelt</i>, and that is an expression of “heavenly,” [meaning] the highest part of the beam. But I say, they are hollowed bricks, and they are like half a round reed, which are used as coverings for houses. (In German, <i>dek</i> <i>tzigel</i>.)
<b>Paneling.</b> In Aramaic it is גובתא דקניא which were (above) and the planks (below).
<b>And connected planks.</b> Planks of cedar arranged above the paneling upon which they walk when they go up to repair the building. And similarly, [Targum] Yonoson rendered ושדרות בארזים as, “above them (i.e., the paneling) was an arrangement of a succession [דרכפת] of cedar wooden planks,” and “&amp;רכפת“ is an expression of a succession, comparable to, “clouds of heaven,”<sup>23</sup><i class="footnote">II Shmuel 22:12.</i> which [Targum] Yonoson rendered, “a succession [=מריכפת] of light clouds.”

### passuk 10
<b>Five <i>amohs</i> high.</b> Of each one. Therefore, their total height was fifteen <i>amohs</i> besides the thickness of the ceiling.
<b>And he covered the Beis Hamikdosh.</b> That is the upper covering of the roof, and the covering [=והספון] mentioned above that was the ceiling of the upper story.

<b>To the ceiling.</b> He made the walls of cedar until the ceiling to cover the walls of stone in order to coat it with gold.
<b>He built it.</b> Those twenty <i>amohs</i>.
<b>On the inner side of the partition.</b> Inward of the “Amma Traksin” [partition], which separated between the forty [<i>amohs</i>] and the twenty [<i>amohs</i>], and that partition is called “Dvir.”<sup>25</sup><i class="footnote">Also, “Dvir” sometimes means the Holy of Holies. See Rashi in v. 5 above and also the Metzudas Tzion there.</i>
<b>For the Holy of Holies.</b> He designated those twenty <i>amohs</i>.

### passuk 17
<b>That is the Sanctuary before it.</b> In front of the partition towards the outside.

### passuk 18
<b>The cedar of the inside of the Beis Hamikdosh was carved with designs.</b> This means, that those cedar boards which he made for the inside of the building to cover the stone walls, were carved with figured carvings and forms of fragments resembling knobs; פקעים are <i>imosjjls,</i> in O.F.
<b>Of buds and blossoming flowers.</b> [Targum] Yonoson rendered, “and cords and flowers,” in the form of chains.
<b>Buds.</b> [פטורי is] an expression of cords in the language of the Talmud, as in, “as the rope through the loophole.”<sup>26</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Berachos 8a.</i>
<b>Blossoming flowers.</b> [צצים is] an expression of flowers, as in, “and it bloomed [ויצץ] buds [ציץ],”<sup>27</sup><i class="footnote">Bamidbar 17:23.</i> cords and blossoms. But Menachem related פטורי as an expression of, “to open [פטר] of the womb,”<sup>28</sup><i class="footnote">Shemos 13:12.</i> and as in, “they open [יפטירו] the lip.”<sup>29</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim 22:8.</i>
<b>All was cedar [wood] no stone was visible.</b> [Targum Yonoson rendered,] “the whole building was covered with cedar boards, no stone was visible.”
<b>Carved with designs.</b> [Targum] Yonoson rendered, “and engraved was a resemblance of eggs.”<sup>30</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, פקעים are designs of fruit.—Metzudas Tzion.</i> (Meaning engraved in the shape of round eggs.)

### passuk 19
<b>And the Holy of Holies within the Beis Hamikdosh.</b> The “Amoh Traksin” partition.
<b>To place.</b> [It has the same meaning] as לתת.<sup>31</sup><i class="footnote">Knowing that the Beis Hamikdosh will eventually be destroyed Shlomo “prepared ]=[הכין” for the moment by excavating under the Sanctuary a chamber that was hidden in deep and winding tunnels. The chamber was large enough to accommodate the Ark which would be hidden there right before the destruction. See II Divrei Hayomim 35:3 and Maseches Yoma 52b.</i>

### passuk 20
<b>The inside of the Holy of Holies.</b> Within that partition was an area of twenty [<i>amohs</i>] long and twenty [<i>amohs</i>] wide.
<b>And twenty <i>amohs</i> high.</b> I.e., the height of the Holy of Holies was lower than that of the Temple.<sup>32</sup><i class="footnote">The height of the Holy of Holies was twenty <i>amohs</i>, and the height of the Temple was stated as thirty <i>amohs</i> in v. 2 above.</i>
<b>He covered it.</b> The Sanctuary, [i.e.,] the partition.
<b>Refined gold.</b> Our Rabbis explained this [סגור], that at the time [this type of gold] was offered for sale, all other stores were closed [=נסגרות].<sup>33</sup><i class="footnote">See Maseches Yoma 45a. The other stores were closed because no one would want to buy regular gold.</i> But [Targum] Yonoson rendered this as “good gold,” i.e., he who possesses this gold “locks” it [סוגרו] for himself.<sup>34</sup><i class="footnote">It is so precious that he keeps it closed up all the time.</i>
<b>[He] covered the altar with cedar wood.</b> That is the [golden] altar of incense, but I am perplexed, why was Moshe’s [golden altar] hidden?

<b>Olive wood.</b> [Targum Yonoson rendered,] “olive wood.”<sup>35</sup><i class="footnote">עצי שמן literally means “oil wood.” Rashi indicates they are identical. However, in Nechemya 8:15 they are listed separately.</i>
<b>Ten <i>amohs</i> high.</b> And their legs were standing on the ground,<sup>36</sup><i class="footnote">Unlike the cherubim that were made by Betzalel which were on the cover of the Ark and faced each other . See Shemos 37:9.</i> one was on the north of the Ark and one on the south, covering the Ark and its poles. The length of the wings covered part (of the poles’ width) since the Ark’s length was set to the width of the Temple, and its poles were protruding at the entrance of the Holy of Holies into the curtain which was at the entrance. Its poles were set at the ends of the Ark’s length, in order that two <i>Leviyim</i> should be able to enter between them, when they were carrying it in the wilderness.

### passuk 24
<b>It was ten <i>amohs</i> from one end of its wings to the [other] end of its wings.</b> When they are spread, the wings of both [cherubs], which touched one another, filled the entire space of twenty <i>amohs</i>; and the bodies of the cherubim are not included in the measurement, and stood miraculously.<sup>37</sup><i class="footnote">See Maseches Bava Basra 99a. Alternatively, the wings were attached to the cherubs in such a way that the two wings of each cherub touched each other without any space between them. Thus a miracle was not necessary.—Radak.</i>

<b>Olive wood.</b> Olive wood.
<b>The lintel.</b> These are the lintels [=אילי] of the entrance, these are the doorposts from each side that were made round, similar to אילים,<sup>39</sup><i class="footnote">Yechezkeil 40:21.</i> איליו,<sup>40</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. 40:9.</i> ואילמיו<sup>41</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. 40:10.</i> (other texts: אלה' ואלון), and similarly in all of Yechezkeil’s structure[s],<sup>42</sup><i class="footnote">See Ibid. 40.</i> the doorposts at the entrance are called אילים.<sup>43</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi Ibid. 40:9.</i>
<b>The door-posts.</b> [The door frame consisted of five parts.] The threshold is one, and the side posts on each side are two, totaling three, and the lintel which is on it was made in two, like this. Thus have I heard.<sup>44</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, it was the fifth of a series of doorways of the Beis Hamikdosh encountered by one entering from the outside.—Ralbag.</i> But I say, מזוזות חמישית [refers to the] five sides that each of the door posts had, and it was not four-sided; and [the verse] is speaking neither about the threshold nor about the lintel, because we find neither the threshold nor the lintel called “אילים.”

### passuk 32
<b>He hammered upon the <i>cherubim.</i></b> He spread the gold in thin sheets [in order] to sink them into the engraved forms, so that it be recessed into the engraved places and protrude on the protrusions, so that the gold does not ruin the figures, and so that the figures in the wood are distinguishable under the gold.

### passuk 33
<b>Consisting of four parts.</b> The side posts [i.e., the entire door frames] of the Sanctuary were square, and so did [Targum] Yonoson translate, “from their four sides squared.”

### passuk 34
<b>And two doors.</b> Each [door] was half the width of the entrance.

<b>Rounded.</b> [Targum Yonoson rendered,] oval.
<b>Two [rounded] hinges.</b> Also this is rendered [by Targum Yonoson] “hinges.” The expression קלעים, I maintain, is of Aramaic derivation, an expression meaning “entrance,” because the hinge enters into the cavity of the threshold.<sup>46</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, קלעים are curtains, meaning that the doors folded in the same manner a curtain does.</i>

### passuk 35
<b>And he carved upon them <i>cherubim.</i></b> On the doors.
<b>Fitting precisely upon the carvings.</b> The gold was fitted onto the carved forms; recessed in the place of its engraving, and protruding in its place of protrusion so that the carved forms are [clearly] distinguishable [in the gold overlay].

### passuk 36
<b>The inner court.</b> This was the court of <i>Kohanim</i> and the court of Yisroel, and it was [located] before the entrance hall, yet he calls it “the inner one” because it was inward of the women’s court.
