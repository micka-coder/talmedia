<b>Shlomo became the son-in-law.</b> As long as Shim’i, his teacher, was alive, he did not enter into marriage [with Pharaoh’s daughter]. From here, [our Sages derived and] declared, that a person should always live in the vicinity of his teacher.<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">Based on the juxtaposition of Shimi’s death and Shlomo’s marriage to Pharaoh’s daughter. See Maseches Berachos 8a.</i><sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">In order to remain under his teacher’s guidance and influence.</i>
<b>Until he finished building, etc.</b> And afterwards he built a house for her.<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, after he finished building the Beis Hamikdosh, Shlomo moved Pharaoh’s daughter out of the City of Dovid which had become sanctified by the presence of the Ark.—Radak</i>

### passuk 2
<b>Sacrificed on improvised altars.</b> For the sake of Heaven, each [person] who so desired would build an altar on top of his roof or in his yard.<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">This was permitted during the period between the destruction of the Mishkan in Shilo and the construction of the Beis Hamikdosh. See Mishnayos Zevachim 14:7.</i>

### passuk 3
<b>And Shlomo loved Adonoy, he conformed to the decrees of his father Dovid.</b> [During the first] four years, before beginning to build the Beis [Hamikdosh]. But once he began to build and Shlomo married Pharaoh’s daughter, consequently it states, “for as a provocation of anger and of fury has this city has been to me from the day that they built it until this day.”<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote">Yirmiyahu 32:31.</i> Thus we learned in Seder Olam. We learn that the passages are not written in chronological order.
<b>Upon improvised altars he brought sacrifices.</b> The text discusses his dishonor, [this occurred] because he delayed the construction of the Beis [Hamikdosh] four years.<sup>6</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, Shlomo desired to attain prophetic revelation by offering sacrifices.—Ralbag</i>

### passuk 4
<b>For that was the great improvised altar.</b> That was the copper altar which Moshe made in the wilderness,<sup>7</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., it was “great” because of its holiness.</i> and it was instituted in Shilo. Shilo was destroyed in Eili’s days, and then it came to Nov. Nov was destroyed in Shaul’s days, and they came to Givon.
<b>Shlomo offered.</b> Did Shlomo offer.<sup>8</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, יעלה means, “will offer.”</i>
<b>Upon that altar.</b> In one day.

<b>You preserved for him.</b> An expression of authenticating His words as in, “And Adonoy, your God will keep for you, etc.”<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote">Devarim 7:12.</i> Here too You have preserved for him the kindness, You have authenticated Your words to fulfill to him the kindness which You had promised him through Noson the prophet.

### passuk 7
<b>A small lad.</b> He was twelve years old. And this is how [his age] is calculated: “And he called his name Yedidyah.”<sup>10</sup><i class="footnote">II Shmuel 12:25.</i> At the same time Amnon raped Tamar, as it is stated, “And it was after this, and Avsholom [the son of Dovid] had a sister.”<sup>11</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid., 13:1.</i> At the end of, “two years, and Avsholom had sheep shearers,”<sup>12</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. v. 23.</i> and he killed Amnon. Avsholom fled and went to Geshur, and he remained there three years,<sup>13</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. v. 38.</i> so we have five years. Avsholom then returned to Yerusholayim, “and [Avsholom] lived in Yerusholayim two years,”<sup>14</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. 14:28.</i> so we have seven [years in the life] of Shlomo. And he [Avsholom] rebelled against his father and was killed. After this, [it states], “And there was famine in the days of Dovid [for] three years,”<sup>15</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. 21:1.</i> so we have ten [years]. In the eleventh [year] he counted the [Bnei] Yisroel, “and they scattered in all the land,”<sup>16</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid 24:8.</i> nine months. In the year of his death he instituted divisions as it is stated, “In the fortieth year of Dovid’s reign they were sought,”<sup>17</sup><i class="footnote">I Divrei Hayomim 26:31.</i> so we have twelve [years in the life] of King Shlomo.<sup>18</sup><i class="footnote">Other, including Abarbanel, suggest that Shlomo may have been around twenty years old at the time. The fact that he is referred to as a “lad ]=נער]” is not necessarily a reflection of his age, for in Bereishis 44:22, Binyomin is described as a “lad [=נער]”at the age of thirty.</i>

### passuk 9
<b>This great people of Yours.</b> Since they are many, they have many dealings, and they come to litigate and I have no time to deliberate over their arguments. Another interpretation of, “for who is able to judge this great people of Yours,” their legal decisions are very difficult [for me to make]. If a lawsuit comes before me between two non-Jews, and I take from one and give to the other unjustly, I will not be punished. But [if a lawsuit comes before me] between Jews [and I take from one and give to the other unjustly], I will be punished for it with capital punishment,<sup>19</sup><i class="footnote">That is why Shlomo refers to the Bnei Yisroel as a “weighty [=כבד] nation.”</i> as it is stated, “And He takes the lives of those that steal from them.”<sup>20</sup><i class="footnote">Mishlei 22:23.</i>

<b>And if you will go in My ways, etc., I will lengthen your days.</b> The wealth and the honor for which I did not impose any conditions in my Torah to give to the king, I will give you whether deserving or not. However, [to attain] longevity and [continuation of] the monarchy for [future] generations, I have already imposed conditions in my Torah, “that he shall not turn aside from the commandment [etc.,] so that he may prolong days over his kingdom, etc.”<sup>21</sup><i class="footnote">Devarim 17:20.</i> and that condition I will not alter. So, “if you will go in My ways...I will lengthen, etc.” and likewise concerning [the continuation of] the monarchy to his descendants, He said to him, “As for you, if you walk before Me, etc., no man [descendant] of yours will be cut off, etc.”<sup>22</sup><i class="footnote">Below, 9:4, 5.</i> Thus is it learned in Sifrei, Rabbi Chanina the son of Gamliel says, “Behold he has said, ‘both wealth and honor, etc.’”<sup>23</sup><i class="footnote">Above v. 13.</i>

### passuk 15
<b>Shlomo woke up and behold it was a dream.</b> And behold he understood that his dream was true. He heard a bird chirping and understood its language, a dog barking and he understood its language.
<b>And [he] made a feast.</b> Out of his heart’s happiness [he celebrated] because he realized that his dream was true.<sup>24</sup><i class="footnote">Shlomo celebrated his newly acquired wisdom. Rabbi Elazar said that from here we derive the custom of making a festive meal [e.g., siyum] to honor the completion of reading the Torah or studying a Masechta. See Shir Hashirim Rabboh 1:9.</i>
