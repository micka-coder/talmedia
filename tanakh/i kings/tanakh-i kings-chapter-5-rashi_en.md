<b>In shifts.</b> As he concludes and says, “they will be a month in Levanon.” When the ten thousand men were in Levanon in Tishrei and the twenty thousand men were at home in Mar Cheshvan, the second ten thousand would alternate and go out to Levanon and these would return to their home[s]. And in Kislev the third ten thousand would go out to Levanon, and these [second ones] would return to their home[s]. And in Teiveis the first ones go out and return to Levanon, and thus they would continue the cycle, which resulted that each ten thousand among them spent one month in Levanon and two months at home.
<b>In charge of the tax.</b> To collect it.

### passuk 29
<b>Seventy thousand men who carried loads.</b> To bring the stones from the mountain to the city, and there were [an additional] eighty thousand who quarried them from the mountain, totaling one hundred fifty thousand [workers]. And they were all proselytes who were drawn, [i.e.,] they converted because of Shlomo’s greatness and his hospitality. And it is likewise written in Divrei Hayomim, “And Shlomo counted all the proselytes and they were found a hundred and fifty thousand. And he made seventy thousand, etc.”<sup>20</sup><i class="footnote">II Divrei Hayomim 2:17.</i>

### passuk 30
<b>Chief officers.</b> The oppressors and overseers over those who did the work.
<b>Three thousand three hundred [officers].</b> And in II Divrei Hayomim it says, “[three thousand] and six hundred.”<sup>21</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i> It is my opinion that three thousand three hundred men were in charge of one hundred fifty thousand, so that each one was in charge of slightly over forty-five, and the three hundred that were added in Divrei Hayomim were in charge of all of them, so that each was in charge of a little more than five hundred. And you should know that there are two additional passages regarding this matter, that contradict each other. For [further on] in this book it states, “These were the supervising officers that oversaw the work for Shlomo, [there were] five hundred and fifty [of them],”<sup>22</sup><i class="footnote">I Melochim 9:23.</i> and in Divrei Hayomim it says, “two hundred and fifty.”<sup>23</sup><i class="footnote">II Divrei Hayomim 8:10.</i> These are four verses contradicting each other. But we may explain that those that are in the latter verses<sup>24</sup><i class="footnote">I Melochim 9:23 and II Divrei Hayomim 8:10.</i> are referring to those who were in charge of all of them. And Shlomo had employed these proselytes to be bearers of burdens to hew stones in the mountain. He had the remaining workers for the store cities who were native born [Jews], because these passages are stated there.<sup>25</sup><i class="footnote">In II Divrei Hayomim the passages discuss the store cities.</i> However, in the book of Melochim he counted the proselyte officers in two separate totals. [First was the total of] the officers who were in charge of forty-five men each, separately, and he combined<sup>26</sup><i class="footnote">In I Melochim 9:23.</i> the three hundred superior officers with the two hundred and fifty men who were in charge of the builders of the store cities and total together five hundred and fifty officers. And in II Divrei Hayomim he counted all the proselyte officers separately, the more important together with the less important, three thousand six hundred [men], all were proselytes. And the officers [in charge of the workers] in the store cities who totaled two hundred and fifty Jews, he counted separately.
<b>Who controlled the people that did the work.</b> The taskmasters over the people who did the work.

### passuk 31
<b>And they brought.</b> From the mountains; an expression of uprooting.
<b>Heavy stones.</b> Heavy.
<b>Hewn stone.</b> Carved and chiseled. And if you ask, it has already been stated, “Neither hammer nor axe [nor any iron tool] was heard in the Beis Hamikdosh, during its construction.”<sup>27</sup><i class="footnote">Below 6:7.</i> The explanation is, that no iron was heard in the Beis [Hamikdosh], while it was being built, but they would chisel on the outside, and bring in and build [it] inside. Thus is this expounded in the Maseches Sotah.<sup>28</sup><i class="footnote">See 48b.</i>

### passuk 32
<b>[And they] carved.</b> In the mountains.
<b>And the Givlim.</b> A nation whose name was Geval, and they were skilled in chiseling stones and in building,<sup>29</sup><i class="footnote">Geval comes from the word גבול [=boundary]. The Givlim knew how to mark the boundaries of the stone before they cut it, and were thus able to cut stone to exact dimensions.</i> as it is stated in reference to Tzur, “The elders of Geval and its wise men, were within you, caulkers of your cracks.”<sup>30</sup><i class="footnote">Yechezkeil 27:9.</i>
<b>And they prepared.</b> An expression of designating.<sup>31</sup><i class="footnote">The stones and wood to their exact position. </i>
