<b>Is there no other prophet of Hachem?</b> I have a tradition that no two prophets prophesy with the same expression, and these are all saying the same expression.<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">See Maseches Sanhedrin 89a.</i><sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">Yehoshofot did not accuse them directly of not being God’s prophets out of respect for Achov.—Radak</i>

<b>Go up and be successful.</b> He did not say [it] to him in God’s Name.<sup>6</sup><i class="footnote">He was merely wishing him good luck, or giving him a blessing that he succeed.—Metzudas Dovid</i>
<b>And may Hachem give.</b> If only He deliver it into the king’s hand.

<b>These have no masters.</b> You alone will die in the war, as the matter is stated below, “Do not battle the small or the great, but only with the king of Yisroel himself.”<sup>7</sup><i class="footnote">Below v. 31.</i> Even though it was stated, “and your people instead of his people,”<sup>8</sup><i class="footnote">Above 20:42.</i> the drop of blood that came out of the righteous man, Michoyhu, whose friend struck him, striking and wounding him, was an atonement for all Yisroel. So it is explained in the [Midrash] Aggadah.<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Yerushalmi Maseches Sanhedrin 10:5.</i>

<b>To His right and to His left.</b> Is there “left” in Heaven? Is it not stated, “The right hand of Hachem’s is exalted, the right hand of Hachem performs deeds of valor,”<sup>10</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim 118:16.</i> [and,] “Your right hand, Hachem, is adorned with power; Your right hand, Hachem, crushes the enemy”<sup>11</sup><i class="footnote">Shemos 15:6.</i>? But rather, these are on the right and these are on the left. Those on the right present the case for the defense and those on the left present the case for the prosecution.

<b>When did the spirit of Hachem pass?</b> [I.e.,] which way did it pass? This is an abbreviated verse.<sup>13</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the word דרך [=way] is missing.</i> In Divrei Hayomim it is written, “In what way did [Hachem’s spirit] pass.”<sup>14</sup><i class="footnote">II Divrei Hayomim 18:23.</i>

<b>The king of Yisroel said to Yehoshofot, I will disguise myself and go into battle.</b> To disguise himself and go [into battle]. I will disguise myself, [i.e.,] I will change my royal garments, so that they will not recognize me, for if they recognize me, they will turn toward me to attack.
<b>But you wear your own [royal] garments.</b> That you are wearing, for you are not the king of Yisroel, but the king of Yehudah, and they have no conflict with you.

<b>A man drew.</b> This was Naaman.<sup>15</sup><i class="footnote">Who would later be cured from leprosy by Elisha. See II Melochim 5:1-15.</i>
<b>Innocently [without aiming].</b> He was not aware that he was the king of Yisroel.<sup>16</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, לתמו means “to complete it,” i.e., the prophecies of Michoyhu and Eliyahu were completed with the death of Achov. See Maseches Sanhedrin 39b.</i>
<b>Between the plates of armor.</b> Some coats of mail are made of layers of scales, in the manner it is stated, “and a coat of mail,”<sup>17</sup><i class="footnote">I Shmuel 17:5.</i> and the scales fall on the holes of the coat and close them, and they are called “דבקים” [=attached].

### passuk 35
<b>Stood up in the chariot.</b> He exerted himself and stood so that the [Bnei] Yisroel would not become aware of his wound and flee, for flight is the beginning of defeat.

<b>And the dogs licked his blood.</b> I say that Novos was killed there, for the prophet said, “In the place where the dogs licked the blood of Navos, etc.”<sup>18</sup><i class="footnote">Above 21:19.</i><sup>19</sup><i class="footnote">But how is this possible, Navos was killed in Yizreel while Achov was killed in Shomron? Radak suggests that Yizreel was near Shomron and the water of the pool in Shomron flowed to Yizreel where dogs licked Achov’s blood which was mixed in the water.</i>
<b>And they washed the weapons [there].</b> And they washed off blood from the weapons there, [Targum] Yonoson rendered it in this manner. But our Rabbis said, “Achov was a cold person, so Ezevel made for him the image of two prostitutes in his chariot.<sup>20</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Sanhedrin 39b and Rashi there.</i> <sup>21</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, “the prostitutes bathed there,” in the pool of Shomron, which was now mixed with Achov’s blood.—Metzudas Dovid</i>

<b>Yehoshofot made peace with the king of Yisroel.</b> Since there was war between Asa his father and Basha the king of Yisroel, it was necessary to say this.

<b>There was no king in Edom.</b> [Beginning with] the time of Dovid, the governor<sup>22</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the governor that was appointed by the king of Yehudah.—Radak</i> was the king. This was written here because in the days of Yehorom his son who sinned, in his days Edom rebelled and crowned a king for themselves, but in the time of Yehoshofot they were still subordinate to him.

### passuk 49
<b>For they [the ships] were broken.</b> Since he joined Achazyahu in this [undertaking], therefore, they were broken. And so did the prophet say to him in Divrei Hayomim, “Because you have allied yourself with a Achazyahu, Hachem has wrecked your undertakings.”<sup>23</sup><i class="footnote">II Divrei Hayomim 20:37.</i>

### passuk 52
<b>In the seventeenth year of Yehoshofot.</b>  Some wonder about this verse, because it is stated concerning Achov that he reigned twenty-two [years],<sup>24</sup><i class="footnote">Above 16:29.</i> and concerning Yehoshofot it is stated, that he became king “in the fourth year of Achov,”<sup>25</sup><i class="footnote">Above v. 41.</i> thus resulting that Achov’s [rule] ended in the nineteenth year of Yehoshofot[’s rule], but here it states that Achazyahu became king in the seventeenth year of Yehoshofot[’s rule]. However, I searched and found in Divrei Hayomim concerning the kings of Yisroel, that [Scripture] is not exact in the number of their years, and if one became king at the end of a year, he counts it at the beginning, but he does not count it elsewhere.  Therefore I say that, “in the fourth year of Achov,” that is mentioned in reference to when Yehoshofot became king, does not count with it Achov’s first year [of kingship]. And so you find in the majority [of cases]. Also, the year in which Yehoshofot became king is not included in these seventeen years.
