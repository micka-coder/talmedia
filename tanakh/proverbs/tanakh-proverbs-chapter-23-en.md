### passuk 1
When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider well him that is before thee;

### passuk 2
And put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to appetite.

### passuk 3
Be not desirous of his dainties; seeing they are deceitful food.

### passuk 4
Weary not thyself to be rich; Cease from thine own wisdom. .

### passuk 5
Wilt thou set thine eyes upon it? it is gone; For riches certainly make themselves wings, Like an eagle that flieth toward heaven.

### passuk 6
Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, Neither desire thou his dainties;

### passuk 7
For as one that hath reckoned within himself, so is he: ‘Eat and drink’, saith he to thee; But his heart is not with thee.

### passuk 8
The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, And lose thy sweet words.

### passuk 9
Speak not in the ears of a fool; for he will despise the wisdom of thy words.

### passuk 10
Remove not the ancient landmark; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless;

### passuk 11
For their Redeemer is strong; He will plead their cause with thee.

### passuk 12
Apply thy heart unto instruction, And thine ears to the words of knowledge.

### passuk 13
Withhold not correction from the child; For though thou beat him with the rod, he will not die.

### passuk 14
Thou beatest him with the rod, And wilt deliver his soul from the nether-world.

### passuk 15
My son, if thy heart be wise, My heart will be glad, even mine;

### passuk 16
Yea, my reins will rejoice, When thy lips speak right things.

### passuk 17
Let not thy heart envy sinners, But be in the fear of the LORD all the day;

### passuk 18
For surely there is a future; And thy hope shall not be cut off.

### passuk 19
Hear thou, my son, and be wise, And guide thy heart in the way.

### passuk 20
Be not among winebibbers; Among gluttonous eaters of flesh;

### passuk 21
For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty; And drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.

### passuk 22
Hearken unto thy father that begot thee, And despise not thy mother when she is old.

### passuk 23
Buy the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.

### passuk 24
The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice; and he that begetteth a wise child will have joy of him.

### passuk 25
Let thy father and thy mother be glad, and let her that bore thee rejoice.

### passuk 26
My son, give me thy heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways. .

### passuk 27
For a harlot is a deep ditch; and an alien woman is a narrow pit.

### passuk 28
She also lieth in wait as a robber, and increaseth the faithless among men.

### passuk 29
Who crieth: ‘Woe’? who: ‘Alas’? Who hath contentions? who hath raving? Who hath wounds without cause? Who hath redness of eyes?

### passuk 30
They that tarry long at the wine; They that go to try mixed wine.

### passuk 31
Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth its colour in the cup, When it glideth down smoothly;

### passuk 32
At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like a basilisk.

### passuk 33
Thine eyes shall behold strange things, and thy heart shall utter confused things.

### passuk 34
Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.

### passuk 35
’They have struck me, and I felt it not, they have beaten me, and I knew it not; when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.’
