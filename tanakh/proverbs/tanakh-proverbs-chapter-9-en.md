### passuk 1
Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars;

### passuk 2
She hath prepared her meat, she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table.

### passuk 3
She hath sent forth her maidens, she calleth, upon the highest places of the city:

### passuk 4
’Whoso is thoughtless, let him turn in hither’; as for him that lacketh understanding, she saith to him:

### passuk 5
'Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled.

### passuk 6
Forsake all thoughtlessness, and live; and walk in the way of understanding.

### passuk 7
He that correcteth a scorner getteth to himself shame, and he that reproveth a wicked man, it becometh unto him a blot.

### passuk 8
Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee; reprove a wise man, and he will love thee.

### passuk 9
Give to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser; teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning.

### passuk 10
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the All-holy is understanding.

### passuk 11
For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.

### passuk 12
If thou art wise, thou art wise for thyself; And if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.’

### passuk 13
The woman Folly is riotous; She is thoughtless, and knoweth nothing.

### passuk 14
And she sitteth at the door of her house, On a seat in the high places of the city,

### passuk 15
To call to them that pass by, Who go right on their ways:

### passuk 16
’Whoso is thoughtless, let him turn in hither’; And as for him that lacketh understanding, she saith to him:

### passuk 17
’Stolen waters are sweet, And bread eaten in secret is pleasant.’

### passuk 18
But he knoweth not that the shades are there; that her guests are in the depths of the nether-world.
