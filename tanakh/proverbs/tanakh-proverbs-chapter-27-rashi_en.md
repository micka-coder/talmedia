<b>Do not boast</b> Do not boast now concerning a thing that is destined to be tomorrow.
<b>for you do not know what the day will bear</b> Perhaps the day will bear some evil that will nullify it.

### passuk 2

### passuk 3
<b>and the burden</b> Heb. ונטל, a burden.
<b>the anger of a fool</b> that a fool angers the Holy One, blessed be He, causes [Him] to bring anger to the world.

### passuk 4

### passuk 5

### passuk 6
<b>are burdensome</b> Heb. נעתרות, an expression of largeness, as in (Ezek. 35: 13): “You have multiplied (נעתרות) against Me.”

### passuk 7
<b>tramples honeycomb</b> Heb. תבוס, tramples by foot, as in (Ps. 44:6): “we will trample (נבוס) those who rise up against us.”
<b>all bitter is sweet</b> Every sweet thing is bitter to it. This can be interpreted in regard to the study of the Torah. If one shows himself to be sated, that he has no desire for words of the Torah as a desire of his soul, he tramples honeycomb. [That is,] even the reasons that are acceptable to the heart are not important to him, but he who yearns for it, even the things that come to him with bitterness and toil are sweet to him.

### passuk 8
<b>wandering from its nest</b> that goes and wanders, so is a man who wanders from his place, i.e., a Torah scholar who wanders away from his studies, from reviewing what he learned.

### passuk 9
<b>Oil and incense</b> The scent of balsamum oil and the scent of incense cause the heart to rejoice.
<b>and the sweet words of his friend more than one’s own counsel</b> He whose friend draws him near with words is better than what his [own] soul advises him. Another explanation: <b>and the sweetness of his friend</b> who improves his deeds, that they should be sweet to the Holy One, blessed be He, is better for him than gratifying the desires of his heart.

### passuk 10
<b>your friend and your father’s friend</b> The Holy One, blessed be He, Who is called a friend to Israel, and your father’s friend, for He endeared your forefathers.
<b>Do not forsake</b> And, if you do forsake Him, retribution will befall you.
<b>and...your brother’s house</b> Do not rely on the children of Esau and Ishmael that they should befriend you. We find that when Israel was exiled to Babylon, they would say to those who led them in neck irons, “We beg of you, lead us on the way of our brethren, the sons of Esau and Ishmael,” and the sons of Esau went out toward them and welcomed them with various kinds of salty foods and blown up flasks.
<b>than a distant brother</b> It is better that the One Who is near to those who call Him dwell among you than that you should come to your brother who distanced himself by saying (Gen. 27:41): “When the days of mourning for my father are at hand, etc.”

### passuk 11
<b>Be wise, my son</b> Heb. חכם, become wise, my son.
<b>and cause my heart to rejoice</b> and let my heart be happy with you.

<b>A cunning man saw harm</b> He sees the retribution coming upon the earth and hides from it by withdrawing from sin, but the fools did not hide and passed on the way of harm.

### passuk 13
<b>because he stood surety for a stranger</b> A man who stood surety brings about that the judge should say to the creditor, “Take his garment.”

### passuk 14
<b>He who blesses his friend</b> Someone blesses his friend daily, and the blessing is converted into a curse, for people say about him that he is generous with his money and wealthy, and everyone comes and borrows from him, and the government provokes him to collect his money. In this manner, it is interpreted in tractate Arachin (16a). Besides this, it appears in the midrash of Rabbi Tanhuma (Balak 15) as regards Balaam, who blessed Israel with a loud voice, as it is stated (Num. 23:7): “And he took up his discourse, etc.,” an expression of raising the voice, and he later counseled to cause them to sin.

### passuk 15
<b>A constant dripping</b> Rain that drips from the roof into the house and drives out the inhabitants of the house.
<b>on a rainstormy day</b> Heb. סגריר, a rainy day, when all are shut in their houses.
<b>and a quarrelsome woman, are alike</b> They are both the same...

### passuk 16
<b>He who guards her guards the wind</b> He who thinks to watch her from her lewdness guards the wind; just as it is impossible to guard the wind, so will she not be guarded.
<b>and he calls “the oil of his right hand”</b> He calls “tzaraath” to come upon him until he drives her out like a “metzora,” who is purified with oil on the thumb of his right hand [as in Lev. 14:17].

### passuk 17
<b>sharpens the countenance of his friend</b> Heb. יחד, sharpens. Torah scholars sharpen each other in halachah.

### passuk 18
<b>shall eat its fruit</b> and so will one who guards his master be honored and eat the fruit of his deeds.

### passuk 19
<b>As in water</b> the face that you show it, it shows you.
<b>is the heart of a man to a man</b> his friend. According to how much a man knows that his friend loves him, so he will show him his face.

### passuk 20
<b>The grave and Gehinnom will not be sated</b> from receiving the wicked therein, just as the eyes of a wicked man will not be sated from wandering after temptation and gratifying his lust.

### passuk 21

### passuk 22
<b>grain</b> Heb. הריפות, wheat crushed in a mortar.
<b>in a mortar</b> Heb. במכתש, a mortar, in French mortier; Morser in German.
<b>with a pestle</b> Heb. בעלי, a pestle, pilon in French, Stossel in German. Since they lift it up (מעלין) and beat with it, it is called עלי.

### passuk 23
<b>the condition of your flocks</b> lit. the face of your flocks. Do not think lightly of always paying attention to them to determine what they require.

### passuk 24
<b>For riches are not forever</b> For, if you are rich with silver and gold, perhaps it will not last forever. Therefore, do not despise your small things.

### passuk 25
<b>When the hay is carried away</b> When the hay is carried away in the days of Nissan, the grass becomes visible, and the grasses are gathered to grow (?), then it will be beneficial to you, for you will have the fleece of the lambs for your clothing.

### passuk 26
<b>and... the worth of the field</b> The he-goats will be worth as much as a field because you will eat the flesh and sell the hides.

### passuk 27
<b>and enough</b> for your sustenance.
<b>For your food and the food of your household;</b> you will have sufficient goat milk. This is the figure. The allegory is: <b>the condition of your flocks</b> The teacher who is appointed over the congregation is required to carry them in his bosom and to lead them slowly. <b>For riches are not forever</b> and thereby, he eats the fruit, and the principal remains.
<b>When the hay is carried away</b> When his laws are disseminated and the Torah is magnified through him, then these lambs will be his clothing, and the disciples shall be to him for a name and for raiment of glory and beauty.
