<b>for it is as though it poured gall</b> שער. This שער is vowelized half with a “patach” and half with a “kamatz,” and the accent is at the end of the word; therefore, it is a verb and not a noun; for were it a noun, it would be [vowelized completely with] a “pattah” and the accent would be at the beginning of the word, like every שער in Scriptures. Its meaning is that it as though this food poured gall into the soul of this stingy man, so it is. <b>gall</b> Heb. שער, from the expression of (Jer. 29:17): “the loathsome (השערים) figs,” the bitter ones.
