### passuk 1
My son, forget not my teaching; But let thy heart keep my commandments;

### passuk 2
For length of days, and years of life, And peace, will they add to thee.

### passuk 3
Let not kindness and truth forsake thee; Bind them about thy neck, write them upon the table of thy heart;

### passuk 4
So shalt thou find grace and good favour In the sight of God and man.

### passuk 5
Trust in the LORD with all thy heart, And lean not upon thine own understanding.

### passuk 6
In all thy ways acknowledge Him, And He will direct thy paths.

### passuk 7
Be not wise in thine own eyes; Fear the LORD, and depart from evil;

### passuk 8
It shall be health to thy navel, And marrow to thy bones.

### passuk 9
Honour the LORD with thy substance, And with the first-fruits of all thine increase;

### passuk 10
So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, And thy vats shall overflow with new wine.

### passuk 11
My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD, Neither spurn thou His correction;

### passuk 12
For whom the LORD loveth He correcteth, Even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.

### passuk 13
Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, And the man that obtaineth understanding.

### passuk 14
For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, And the gain thereof than fine gold.

### passuk 15
She is more precious than rubies; And all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.

### passuk 16
Length of days is in her right hand; In her left hand are riches and honour.

### passuk 17
Her ways are ways of pleasantness, And all her paths are peace.

### passuk 18
She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her, And happy is every one that holdest her fast.

### passuk 19
The LORD by wisdom founded the earth; By understanding He established the heavens.

### passuk 20
By His knowledge the depths were broken up, And the skies drop down the dew.

### passuk 21
My son, let not them depart from thine eyes; Keep sound wisdom and discretion;

### passuk 22
So shall they be life unto thy soul, And grace to thy neck.

### passuk 23
Then shalt thou walk in thy way securely, And thou shalt not dash thy foot.

### passuk 24
When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid; Yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.

### passuk 25
Be not afraid of sudden terror, Neither of the destruction of the wicked, when it cometh;

### passuk 26
For the LORD will be thy confidence, And will keep thy foot from being caught.

### passuk 27
Withhold not good from him to whom it is due, When it is in the power of thy hand to do it.

### passuk 28
Say not unto thy neighbour: ‘Go, and come again, And to-morrow I will give’; when thou hast it by thee.

### passuk 29
Devise not evil against thy neighbour, Seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.

### passuk 30
Strive not with a man without cause, If he have done thee no harm.

### passuk 31
Envy thou not the man of violence, And choose none of his ways.

### passuk 32
For the perverse is an abomination to the LORD; But His counsel is with the upright.

### passuk 33
The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked; But He blesseth the habitation of the righteous.

### passuk 34
If it concerneth the scorners, He scorneth them, But unto the humble He giveth grace.

### passuk 35
The wise shall inherit honour; But as for the fools, they carry away shame.
