### passuk 1
The words of king Lemuel; the burden wherewith his mother corrected him.

### passuk 2
What, my son? and what, O son of my womb? And what, O son of my vows?

### passuk 3
Give not thy strength unto women, Nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.

### passuk 4
It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine: Nor for princes to say: ‘Where is strong drink?’

### passuk 5
Lest they drink, and forget that which is decreed, And pervert the justice due to any that is afflicted.

### passuk 6
Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, And wine unto the bitter in soul;

### passuk 7
Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.

### passuk 8
Open thy mouth for the dumb, in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction.

### passuk 9
Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.

### passuk 10
A woman of valour who can find? For her price is far above rubies.

### passuk 11
The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, and he hath no lack of gain.

### passuk 12
She doeth him good and not evil all the days of her life.

### passuk 13
She seeketh wool and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.

### passuk 14
She is like the merchant-ships; she bringeth her food from afar.

### passuk 15
She riseth also while it is yet night,  and giveth food to her household, and a portion to her maidens.

### passuk 16
She considereth a field, and buyeth it; with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.

### passuk 17
She girdeth her loins with strength, And maketh strong her arms.

### passuk 18
She perceiveth that her merchandise is good; Her lamp goeth not out by night.

### passuk 19
She layeth her hands to the distaff, And her hands hold the spindle.

### passuk 20
She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; Yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.

### passuk 21
She is not afraid of the snow for her household; For all her household are clothed with scarlet.

### passuk 22
She maketh for herself coverlets; Her clothing is fine linen and purple.

### passuk 23
Her husband is known in the gates, When he sitteth among the elders of the land.

### passuk 24
She maketh linen garments and selleth them; And delivereth girdles unto the merchant.

### passuk 25
Strength and dignity are her clothing; And she laugheth at the time to come.

### passuk 26
She openeth her mouth with wisdom; And the law of kindness is on her tongue.

### passuk 27
She looketh well to the ways of her household, And eateth not the bread of idleness.

### passuk 28
Her children rise up, and call her blessed; Her husband also, and he praiseth her:

### passuk 29
’Many daughters have done valiantly, But thou excellest them all.’

### passuk 30
Grace is deceitful, and beauty is vain; But a woman that feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.

### passuk 31
Give her of the fruit of her hands; And let her works praise her in the gates.
