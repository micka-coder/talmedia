### passuk 4

This is being gracious to the poor. In this manner, Rabbi Tanhuma expounded on it.

### passuk 9

### passuk 10

### passuk 11

### passuk 12

### passuk 13

### passuk 16

### passuk 17

<b>but no one will support him</b> from Heaven to give him the possibility to repent, so that he will not be in Paradise while his pupil is in Gehinnom. In this manner, it is expounded upon in Tractate Yoma (87a).

### passuk 22
<b>He who hastens to [acquire] wealth</b> He who hastens to increase wealth and steals his heave- offerings and tithes.
<b>that want will come upon him</b> Want will come to him, for a curse will be sent upon the work of his hands.

### passuk 23
<b>He who admonishes man</b> for the sins he has committed and separates him from them.
<b>afterwards will find more favor</b> After a time, he will find more favor in his eyes than one who speaks with flattery. We find in Gen. Rabbah (44:5): “Wherever it says אחרי, it means only long after; אחר, it is soon after. In Tanhuma, in the portion entitled “These are the words”: “He who admonishes man after Me”—this refers to Moses, who admonished Israel after the Holy One, blessed be He, who were called “man,” as it is stated (Ezek. 34:31): “You are men,” and it stated concerning him (Ex. 33: 17): “For you have found favor in My sight.” <b>more favor than he who speaks with flattery</b> This refers to Balaam, who said fine things to Israel (Num. 24:5): “How goodly are your tents, O Jacob!” Moses announces (Deut. 11:16): “Beware lest your heart be deceived,” and Balaam announces and flatters, “Do what your heart desires; He does not care: (Num. 23:19) ‘God is not a man that He should lie,’ concerning the nations, but concerning you, ‘He says but He does not do.’” And Solomon cries about both of them, (above 27:6): “Wounds of a lover are faithful, whereas kisses of an enemy are burdensome.”

### passuk 24
<b>He who robs his father</b> The Holy One, blessed be He.
<b>or his mother</b> The people of Israel. He who causes the people to sin by robbing the Holy One, blessed be He, estranges His children from Him and robs them of goodness.
<b>destroyer</b> Jeroboam.

### passuk 25

<b>stirs up quarrels</b> He incites the Divine standard of justice upon himself

### passuk 26

### passuk 27
<b>He who gives to a poor man</b> charity.
<b>will suffer no want</b> (to give him much charity.) And so it is with the teacher who does not withhold Torah from his pupil.
