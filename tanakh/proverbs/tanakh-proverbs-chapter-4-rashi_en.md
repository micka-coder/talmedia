### passuk 4
<b>And he instructed me</b> concerning that and he chastised me <b>and said to me, “May your heart draw near to my words</b> And since he chastened me with these words, therefore I admonish you concerning this (Rabbi Joseph Kara).

<b>a tender one and an only one before my mother</b> Heb. לפני אמי, before my nation (אמתי) I am chosen and beloved like a tender and only son. Therefore, my father instructed me.
