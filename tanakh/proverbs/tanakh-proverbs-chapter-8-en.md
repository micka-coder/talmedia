### passuk 1
Doth not wisdom call, And understanding put forth her voice?

### passuk 2
In the top of high places by the way, Where the paths meet, she standeth;

### passuk 3
Beside the gates, at the entry of the city, At the coming in at the doors, she crieth aloud:

### passuk 4
’Unto you, O men, I call, And my voice is to the sons of men.

### passuk 5
O ye thoughtless, understand prudence, And, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.

### passuk 6
Hear, for I will speak excellent things, And the opening of my lips shall be right things.

### passuk 7
For my mouth shall utter truth, And wickedness is an abomination to my lips.

### passuk 8
All the words of my mouth are in righteousness, There is nothing perverse or crooked in them.

### passuk 9
They are all plain to him that understandeth, And right to them that find knowledge.

### passuk 10
Receive my instruction, and not silver, And knowledge rather than choice gold.

### passuk 11
For wisdom is better than rubies, And all things desirable are not to be compared unto her.

### passuk 12
I wisdom dwell with prudence, And find out knowledge of devices.

### passuk 13
The fear of the LORD is to hate evil; Pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, And the froward mouth, do I hate.

### passuk 14
Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom; I am understanding, power is mine.

### passuk 15
By me kings reign, And princes decree justice.

### passuk 16
By me princes rule, And nobles, even all the judges of the earth.

### passuk 17
I love them that love me, And those that seek me earnestly shall find me.

### passuk 18
Riches and honour are with me; Yea, enduring riches and righteousness.

### passuk 19
My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; And my produce than choice silver.

### passuk 20
I walk in the way of righteousness, In the midst of the paths of justice;

### passuk 21
That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance, And that I may fill their treasuries.

### passuk 22
The LORD made me as the beginning of His way, The first of His works of old.

### passuk 23
I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, Or ever the earth was.

### passuk 24
When there were no depths, I was brought forth; When there were no fountains abounding with water.

### passuk 25
Before the mountains were settled, Before the hills was I brought forth;

### passuk 26
While as yet He had not made the earth, nor the fields, Nor the beginning of the dust of the world.

### passuk 27
When He established the heavens, I was there; When He set a circle upon the face of the deep,

### passuk 28
When He made firm the skies above, When the fountains of the deep showed their might,

### passuk 29
When He gave to the sea His decree, That the waters should not transgress His commandment, When He appointed the foundations of the earth;

### passuk 30
Then I was by Him, as a nursling; And I was daily all delight, Playing always before Him,

### passuk 31
Playing in His habitable earth, And my delights are with the sons of men.

### passuk 32
Now therefore, ye children, hearken unto me; For happy are they that keep my ways.

### passuk 33
Hear instruction, and be wise, And refuse it not.

### passuk 34
Happy is the man that hearkeneth to me, Watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.

### passuk 35
For whoso findeth me findeth life, And obtaineth favour of the LORD.

### passuk 36
But he that misseth me wrongeth his own soul; All they that hate me love death.’
