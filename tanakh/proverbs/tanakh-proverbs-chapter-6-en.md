### passuk 1
My son, if thou art become surety for thy neighbour, If thou hast struck thy hands for a stranger—

### passuk 2
Thou art snared by the words of thy mouth, Thou art caught by the words of thy mouth—

### passuk 3
Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, Seeing thou art come into the hand of thy neighbour; Go, humble thyself, and urge thy neighbour.

### passuk 4
Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.

### passuk 5
Deliver thyself as a gazelle from the hand [of the hunter], And as a bird from the hand of the fowler.

### passuk 6
Go to the ant, thou sluggard; Consider her ways, and be wise;

### passuk 7
Which having no chief, Overseer, or ruler,

### passuk 8
Provideth her bread in the summer, And gatherest her food in the harvest.

### passuk 9
How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? When wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?

### passuk 10
’Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, A little folding of the hands to sleep’—

### passuk 11
So shall thy poverty come as a runner, And thy want as an armed man.

### passuk 12
A base person, a man of iniquity, Is he that walketh with a froward mouth; .

### passuk 13
That winketh with his eyes, that scrapeth with his feet, That pointeth with his fingers;

### passuk 14
Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth evil continually; He soweth discord.

### passuk 15
Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; On a sudden shall he be broken, and that without remedy.

### passuk 16
There are six things which the LORD hateth, Yea, seven which are an abomination unto Him:

### passuk 17
Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, And hands that shed innocent blood;

### passuk 18
A heart that deviseth wicked thoughts, Feet that are swift in running to evil;

### passuk 19
A false witness that breatheth out lies, And he that soweth discord among brethren.

### passuk 20
My son, keep the commandment of thy father, And forsake not the teaching of thy mother;

### passuk 21
Bind them continually upon thy heart, Tie them about thy neck.

### passuk 22
When thou walkest, it shall lead thee, When thou liest down, it shall watch over thee; And when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.

### passuk 23
For the commandment is a lamp, and the teaching is light, And reproofs of instruction are the way of life;

### passuk 24
To keep thee from the evil woman, From the smoothness of the alien tongue.

### passuk 25
Lust not after her beauty in thy heart; Neither let her captivate thee with her eyelids.

### passuk 26
For on account of a harlot a man is brought to a loaf of bread, But the adulteress hunteth for the precious life.

### passuk 27
Can a man take fire in his bosom, And his clothes not be burned?

### passuk 28
Or can one walk upon hot coals, And his feet not be scorched?

### passuk 29
So he that goeth in to his neighbour’s wife; Whosoever toucheth her shall not go unpunished.

### passuk 30
Men do not despise a thief, if he steal To satisfy his soul when he is hungry;

### passuk 31
But if he be found, he must restore sevenfold, He must give all the substance of his house.

### passuk 32
He that committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding; He doeth it that would destroy his own soul.

### passuk 33
Wounds and dishonour shall he get, And his reproach shall not be wiped away. .

### passuk 34
For jealousy is the rage of a man, And he will not spare in the day of vengeance.

### passuk 35
He will not regard any ransom; Neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.
