### passuk 1
Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, And attend to know understanding.

### passuk 2
For I give you a good taking; Forsake ye not my teaching.

### passuk 3
For I was a son unto my father, Tender and an only one in front of my mother.

### passuk 4
And he taught me, and said unto me: ‘Let thy heart hold fast my words, Keep my commandments, and live;

### passuk 5
Get wisdom, get understanding; Forget not, neither decline from the words of my mouth;

### passuk 6
Forsake her not, and she will preserve thee; Love her, and she will keep thee.

### passuk 7
The beginning of wisdom is: Get wisdom; Yea, with all thy getting get understanding.

### passuk 8
Extol her, and she will exalt thee; She will bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.

### passuk 9
She will give to thy head a chaplet of grace; A crown of glory will she bestow on thee.’

### passuk 10
Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; And the years of thy life shall be many.

### passuk 11
I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in paths of uprightness.

### passuk 12
When thou goest, thy step shall not be straitened; And if thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.

### passuk 13
Take fast hold of instruction, let her not go; Keep her, for she is thy life.

### passuk 14
Enter not into the path of the wicked, And walk not in the way of evil men.

### passuk 15
Avoid it, pass not by it; Turn from it, and pass on.

### passuk 16
For they sleep not, except they have done evil; And their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.

### passuk 17
For they eat the bread of wickedness, And drink the wine of violence.

### passuk 18
But the path of the righteous is as the light of dawn, That shineth more and more unto the perfect day.

### passuk 19
The way of the wicked is as darkness; They know not at what they stumble.

### passuk 20
My son, attend to my words; Incline thine ear unto my sayings.

### passuk 21
Let them not depart from thine eyes; Keep them in the midst of thy heart.

### passuk 22
For they are life unto those that find them, And health to all their flesh.

### passuk 23
Above all that thou guardest keep thy heart; For out of it are the issues of life.

### passuk 24
Put away from thee a froward mouth, And perverse lips put far from thee.

### passuk 25
Let thine eyes look right on, And let thine eyelids look straight before thee.

### passuk 26
Make plain the path of thy feet, And let all thy ways be established.

### passuk 27
Turn not to the right hand nor to the left; Remove thy foot from evil.
