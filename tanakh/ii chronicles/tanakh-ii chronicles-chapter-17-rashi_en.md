<b>in the first ways of David, his father</b> But not the last ways, when he sinned in the incident of Bathsheba, and when the Adversary enticed him to count Israel. This is the most accurate interpretation, but others explain “first” as meaning superior to Solomon and Rehoboam. Regarding Solomon, it is written (I Kings 11:4): “his wives turned away his heart” at the end of his days, and he built a high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.” Regarding Rehoboam, it is written (above 12:1): “And when he became strong, he abandoned the Law of the Lord.” [Jehoshaphat was also not] like Abijam, about whom it is written (I Kings 15:2): “and his heart was not complete with the Lord, his God,” or like Asa, who did not rely on the Lord; [Jehoshaphat] resembled his father, David, who had only one heart for his Father in heaven.
<b>and did not inquire of the baalim</b> like the practice of Israel in his time, for Ahab, who was in his time, worshipped the baalim, as did Israel in his time.

<b>And his heart was uplifted in the ways of the Lord</b> His heart was lifted up in this matter, that he went only in the ways of the Lord. An example of this is (Exod. 35:26): “whose hearts had uplifted them in wisdom.”

### passuk 7
<b>Ben Hail</b> That was his name. Others explain: he sent to his officers, every officer a valiant man. But I have difficulty with this interpretation because, if so, it should have only said, “Obadiah.” The fact that it says, “to Obadiah” proves that Ben Hail was a person’s name.
<b>to teach in the cities of Judah</b> [i.e., to teach] the Torah and to instruct the Children of Israel.

### passuk 8
<b>And with them</b> of the Levites were Shemaiah, Nethaniah, etc.
<b>and with them were Elishama and Jehoram, the priests</b> because it is incumbent upon the priests and the Levites to teach and to instruct, as it is written (Deut. 24:8): “in accordance with everything the priests, the Levites teach you.” The officers went with them because they [the people] would not disobey their orders, and [the officers went] to coerce them [the people] to heed them [the priests] and to observe [and] to do in accordance with the order of the judges. An example (ibid. 15:18): “Judges and law-enforcing officials shall you appoint for yourself”: Judges to judge the people, and law-enforcing officials to coerce them to comply with the orders of the judges.

<b>And the fear of the Lord was upon all the kingdoms of the lands</b> in the merit of having studied Torah.

<b>and loads of silver</b> - Heb. וְכֶסֶף מַשָּׂא, loads of silver. An example (Isa. 46:1): “נְשֻׂאתֵיכֶם עֲמוּסוֹת מַשָּׂא: the things that you carried are made a load.”

### passuk 12
<b>was becoming greater</b> - Heb. וְגָדֵל. Scripture uses] a similar expression in reference to three people: Isaac, Samuel, and Jehoshaphat, but concerning Moses, David, and Mordecai, it says וְגָדוֹל. Concerning Isaac, Samuel, and Jehoshaphat, it says, וְגָדֵל because it is not proper to say וְגָדוֹל, great [in the context in which the word appears in the verse]. In regards to Samuel, it says, (I Sam. 2: 21): “And the lad Samuel grew up with the Lord.” God forbid that it should say, גָדוֹל עִם ה', he was great with the Lord. Here too, he [Jehoshaphat] became great to an unusual degree, גָדֵל עַד לְמָעְלָה. It is therefore improper to say וְגָדוֹל, great. The same applies to Isaac.
<b>towers</b> בִּירָנִיוֹת, derived from בִּירָה, huge towers for strength.
<b>and store cities</b> storage cities, to put in them wheat, wine and grain.

<b>And beside him</b> Heb. וְעַל יָדוֹ beside him; an example is (II Sam. 14:30): “Joab’s field is adjoining mine (אֶל יָדִי).”
<b>who gave generously to the Lord</b> - Heb. הַמִּתְנַדֵּב. An example is (Jud. 5:2) “when the people offer themselves willingly (בְּהִתְנַדֵּב עַם), bless the Lord”
