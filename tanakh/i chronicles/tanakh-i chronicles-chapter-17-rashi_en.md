<b>Now it came to pass when David sat</b> In Samuel (II 7:1) it is written: “...and the Lord had given him rest from around him, etc.” [The next verse says] “but the Ark of God dwells within the curtains,” as is written above (ibid. 6:17): “...inside the tent that David had pitched for it.” David said, “The Holy One, blessed be He, has fulfilled through me, (Deut. 12:10): ‘and He gives you rest from all your enemies round about,’ and I too am obligated to do what is written in close proximity (ibid. verse 11): ‘...then the place that the Lord your God will choose to let his name rest there,’ i.e., I shall build him a tabernacle,”

### passuk 3
<b>And it came to pass on that same night, etc.</b> It is explained in the Midrash (<i>Midrash Sam.</i> 26: 1): “The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Nathan: This man to whom I am sending you is a vower. Go forth and tell him before he swears to build it: You shall not build Me the house for My dwelling.” Another explanation: The man to whom I am sending you is zealous. Go, tell him before he hires workers.

<b>but I have [gone] from tent to tent and from tabernacle</b> i.e., and I have walked from tent to tent and from tabernacle to tabernacle: from Gilgal to Shiloh, and from Shiloh to Nob, and from Nob to Gibeon, and although I was wandering from tent to tent and from tabernacle to tabernacle...

### passuk 6
<b>Wherever I walked among all Israel, I spoke a word, etc.</b> I did not do this, and neither did they spontaneously think of building a house for Me, as it has entered your mind.

### passuk 7
<b>So said the Lord of Hosts</b> For that which entered your mind I shall repay you.
<b>from the sheepcote</b> the dwelling of the shepherds and the sheepfolds.

### passuk 8
<b>and I have made you a name like the name of the great ones</b> like the name of the great kings, for above it is written (14:17): “... and David’s fame went forth throughout all the lands.”

### passuk 9
<b>And I shall appoint a place for My people Israel, and they will dwell in their own place, etc.</b> not as it was in the days of Saul, when Saul was slain and Israel fled, and the Philistines settled in their place.
<b>and the wicked people will no longer afflict them</b> - Heb. לְבַלְּתוֹ like לְעַנּוֹתוֹ (II Sam. 7:10).

### passuk 10
<b>And even from the days that I commanded judges over My people Israel</b> they did not have rest like you, for I vanquished all your enemies before you.
<b>Moreover I tell you</b> what your reward will be, because you wished to build Me a house.
<b>that the Lord will build you a house</b> You thought to build Me a house in My name; your reward will be with the same measure; the Holy One, blessed be He, brings you the tidings that the Lord will give you a son who will reign after you and who will sit on the throne of Israel in your stead, and everything that endures for a person after him is called a house, as it says (v. 11): “... and I shall raise up your seed after you.”

### passuk 11
<b>And it will come to pass when your days are finished to go with your forefathers</b> That is to say, do not fear that I will hasten the matter, but when your days are finished, then it will come about, and I shall raise up your seed after you. <b>and I shall establish his kingdom</b> And so he says of Solomon, (I Kings 2:12): “... and his kingdom was firmly established.”

### passuk 12

### passuk 13
<b>I shall be to him as a father, and he will be to Me as a son</b> And in Samuel (II 7:14), it is written: “... so that when he goes astray, I will chasten him with the rod of men.” The meaning is that if he sins against Me, I will chasten him immediately, as a man who chastens his son with a rod of men, insofar that He raised up against him as adversaries Rezon and Hadad, and on that verse, it is appropriate to say, “... and I shall not remove My loving kindness from him as I removed it from [Saul] who was before you,” and when he sinned before Me, I removed the kingdom from him and from his seed. In Samuel (ibid. 15) it is written: “from Saul.” The reason it is not written here: “so that when he goes astray, etc.” is because of David’s honor, for he does not wish to speak of this in this Book, because it is denigrating to the house of David.

### passuk 16
<b>that You have brought me thus far</b> From the sheepcote you brought me to the kingdom.

### passuk 17
<b>As though this was yet too small a thing in Your eyes</b> that You gave me the kingdom.
<b>from afar</b> that You have established my kingdom until future times, for You said, “And I shall station him in My house and in My kingdom forever.”
<b>and You have regarded me in the manner of a man of high degree</b> that You have equated me and placed me in the rows of the great; i.e., I was small, but You placed me in the row of the princes of Your people, for You said to me, “... and I have made for you a [great] name like the name of the great ones.”
<b>in the manner</b> - Heb. כְּתוֹר. The meaning is a row, and an example is in Kilaim (2:7): “the point of a row (ראשּׁ תּוֹר) of vegetables.”

### passuk 18
<b>What more need David [seek] You</b> The meaning is: What need is there more for David to seek you?
<b>to have glory as Your servant</b> in order to do me honor, that I am Your servant, and You know by Yourself. In Samuel (II 7:20) it is written: “And what more can David say to You? For You know Your servant, O Lord.”

### passuk 19
<b>O Lord, for the sake of Your servant</b> This is connected to the preceding verse, as follows: And You did so much to let me know of all this greatness that You let me know, and all was from the desire of Your heart. Therefore...

### passuk 20
<b>O Lord, there is none like You</b> Perhaps you will say that there is none as great as He, but there is one slightly smaller than He. Therefore. it says: “... and there is no god besides You.”
<b>there is none like You, and there is no god besides You</b> even among the nations.
<b>according to all that we have heard with our ears</b> all our days.

### passuk 21
<b>And who is like Your people Israel, one nation</b> And how are they singled out from all the nations? In this manner... <b>whom God went</b> by Himself. <b>to redeem for Himself a people</b> as a people, as it is written (Exod. 11:4): “I shall step forth in the midst of Egypt.” In this, we were singled out, that He did not do this to any nation in the world.
<b>to drive nations from before Your people, whom You redeemed from Egypt</b> And since You are One in Your world, and Your people are singled out from all nations; therefore, it is fitting for You to give them a proper and great king.

### passuk 22

### passuk 23

### passuk 24
<b>And may Your name be confirmed and magnified forever, saying</b> that they should say, “The Lord of Hosts, etc.,” and also His word endures.
<b>and the house of David Your servant shall be established before You</b> that You spoke, (v. 14): “... and his throne shall be established forever.”

### passuk 25
<b>For You, my God, have revealed</b> It is surely fitting for You to cause Your words to be realized, for You Yourself revealed to [my] ear to build me a house, as it is written: (v. 10): “and I told you and the Lord will build you a house.”
<b>therefore, Your servant has found [occasion] to pray before You</b> i.e., If You Yourself had not promised me to bring upon my seed these favors, it would not enter my mind to make supplication, for who am I that You have brought even this far, but since You said for Your sake to bring me all these favors, I therefore pray that You cause Your words to be realized.

### passuk 26

### passuk 27
<b>for You, O Lord, have blessed</b> You have blessed me.
<b>and [he shall be] blessed forever</b> That is to say, Your servant shall be blessed forever.
