<b>Merib-Baal</b> That is Mephibosheth (II Sam 4:4). Said Rabbi Isaac the son of Samuel of Narbonne: From the time that Israel worshipped the Baal, the Baal was called by the name of Bosheth (shame), as it is written (Jer. 11:13): “altars for the shameful thing, etc.,” for the Baal is a shameful thing. Gideon was called Jerubaal, based on the expression (Jud. 6:32): “Let Baal contend with him.” He was also called Jerubesheth, for it is written concerning Abimelech: “who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubesheth, etc.” in the Book of Samuel (II 11: 21). He is called Jerubesheth and Jerubaal, because Baal and Bosheth are synonymous.
