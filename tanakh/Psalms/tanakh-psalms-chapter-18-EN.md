For the Leader. [A Psalm] of David the servant of the LORD, who spoke unto the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul;

### passuk 2
And he said: I love thee, O LORD, my strength.

### passuk 3
The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; My God, my rock, in Him I take refuge; my shield, and my horn of salvation, my high tower.

### passuk 4
Praised, I cry, is the LORD, and I am saved from mine enemies. .

### passuk 5
The cords of Death compassed me, and the floods of Belial assailed me.

### passuk 6
The cords of Sheol surrounded me; the snares of Death confronted me.

### passuk 7
In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God; out of His temple He heard my voice, and my cry came before Him unto His ears.

### passuk 8
Then the earth did shake and quake, the foundations also of the mountains did tremble; they were shaken, because He was wroth.

### passuk 9
Smoke arose up in His nostrils, and fire out of His mouth did devour; coals flamed forth from Him.

### passuk 10
He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and thick darkness was under His feet.

### passuk 11
And He rode upon a cherub, and did fly; yea, He did swoop down upon the wings of the wind.

### passuk 12
He made darkness His hiding-place, His pavilion round about Him; darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.

### passuk 13
At the brightness before Him, there passed through His thick clouds Hailstones and coals of fire.

### passuk 14
The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Most High gave forth His voice; hailstones and coals of fire.

### passuk 15
And He sent out His arrows, and scattered them; and He shot forth lightnings, and discomfited them.

### passuk 16
And the channels of waters appeared, and the foundations of the world were laid bare, at Thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of Thy nostrils.

### passuk 17
He sent from on high, He took me; He drew me out of many waters.

### passuk 18
He delivered me from mine enemy most strong, and from them that hated me, for they were too mighty for me.

### passuk 19
They confronted me in the day of my calamity; but the LORD was a stay unto me.

### passuk 20
He brought me forth also into a large place; He delivered me, because He delighted in me.

### passuk 21
The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath He recompensed me. .

### passuk 22
For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.

### passuk 23
For all His ordinances were before me, and I put not away His statutes from me.

### passuk 24
And I was single-hearted with Him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.

### passuk 25
Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in His eyes.

### passuk 26
With the merciful Thou dost show Thyself merciful, with the upright man Thou dost show Thyself upright;

### passuk 27
With the pure Thou dost show Thyself pure; and with the crooked Thou dost show Thyself subtle.

### passuk 28
For Thou dost save the afflicted people; but the haughty eyes Thou dost humble.

### passuk 29
For Thou dost light my lamp; the LORD my God doth lighten my darkness.

### passuk 30
For by Thee I run upon a troop; and by my God do I scale a wall.

### passuk 31
As for God, His way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried; He is a shield unto all them that take refuge in Him.

### passuk 32
For who is God, save the LORD? And who is a Rock, except our God?

### passuk 33
The God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way straight;

### passuk 34
Who maketh my feet like hinds', and setteth me upon my high places;

### passuk 35
Who traineth my hands for war, so that mine arms do bend a bow of brass.

### passuk 36
Thou hast also given me Thy shield of salvation, and Thy right hand hath holden me up; and Thy condescension hath made me great.

### passuk 37
Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, and my feet have not slipped.

### passuk 38
I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them; neither did I turn back till they were consumed.

### passuk 39
I have smitten them through, so that they are not able to rise; they are fallen under my feet.

### passuk 40
For Thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle; Thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.

### passuk 41
Thou hast also made mine enemies turn their backs unto me, and I did cut off them that hate me.

### passuk 42
They cried, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD, but He answered them not.

### passuk 43
Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind; I did cast them out as the mire of the streets.

### passuk 44
Thou hast delivered me from the contentions of the people; Thou hast made me the head of the nations; a people whom I have not known serve me.

### passuk 45
As soon as they hear of me, they obey me; The sons of the stranger dwindle away before me.

### passuk 46
The sons of the stranger fade away, and come trembling out of their close places.

### passuk 47
The LORD liveth, and blessed be my Rock; and exalted be the God of my salvation;

### passuk 48
Even the God that executeth vengeance for me, and subdueth peoples under me.

### passuk 49
He delivereth me from mine enemies; yea, Thou liftest me up above them that rise up against me; Thou deliverest me from the violent man.

### passuk 50
Therefore I will give thanks unto Thee, O LORD, among the nations, and will sing praises unto Thy name.

### passuk 51
Great salvation giveth He to His king; and showeth mercy to His anointed, To David and to his seed, for evermore.
