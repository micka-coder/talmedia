### passuk 1
[A Psalm] of David. Unto thee, O LORD, do I call; My Rock, be not Thou deaf unto me; Lest, if Thou be silent unto me, I become like them that go down into the pit.

### passuk 2
Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto Thee, When I lift up my hands toward Thy holy Sanctuary.

### passuk 3
Draw me not away with the wicked, And with the workers of iniquity; Who speak peace with their neighbours, But evil is in their hearts.

### passuk 4
Give them according to their deeds, and according to the evil of their endeavours; Give them after the work of their hands; Render to them their desert.

### passuk 5
Because they give no heed to the works of the LORD, Nor to the operation of His hands; He will break them down and not build them up.

### passuk 6
Blessed be the LORD, Because He hath heard the voice of my supplications.

### passuk 7
The LORD is my strength and my shield, In Him hath my heart trusted, And I am helped; Therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth, And with my song will I praise Him.

### passuk 8
The LORD is a strength unto them; And He is a stronghold of salvation to His anointed.

### passuk 9
Save Thy people, and bless Thine inheritance; And tend them, and carry them for ever.
