### passuk 1
For the Leader. Maschil of David;

### passuk 2
when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, and said unto him: 'David is come to the house of Ahimelech.'

### passuk 3
Why boastest thou thyself of evil, O mighty man? The mercy of God endureth continually.

### passuk 4
Thy tongue deviseth destruction; Like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.

### passuk 5
Thou lovest evil more than good; Falsehood rather than speaking righteousness. Selah

### passuk 6
Thou lovest all devouring words, The deceitful tongue.

### passuk 7
God will likewise break thee for ever, He will take thee up, and pluck thee out of thy tent, And root thee out of the land of the living. Selah

### passuk 8
The righteous also shall see, and fear, And shall laugh at him:

### passuk 9
'Lo, this is the man that made not God his stronghold; But trusted in the abundance of his riches, And strengthened himself in his wickedness.'

### passuk 10
But as for me, I am like a leafy olive-tree in the house of God; I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.

### passuk 11
I will give Thee thanks for ever, because Thou hast done it; And I will wait for Thy name, for it is good, in the presence of Thy saints.
