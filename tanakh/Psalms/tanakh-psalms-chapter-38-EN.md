### passuk 1
A Psalm of David, to make memorial.

### passuk 2
O LORD, rebuke me not in Thine anger; neither chasten me in Thy wrath.

### passuk 3
For Thine arrows are gone deep into me, and Thy hand is come down upon me.

### passuk 4
There is no soundness in my flesh because of Thine indignation; neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin.

### passuk 5
For mine iniquities are gone over my head; as a heavy burden they are too heavy for me.

### passuk 6
My wounds are noisome, they fester, because of my foolishness.

### passuk 7
I am bent and bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day.

### passuk 8
For my loins are filled with burning; and there is no soundness in my flesh.

### passuk 9
I am benumbed and sore crushed; I groan by reason of the moaning of my heart.

### passuk 10
Lord, all my desire is before Thee; and my sighing is not hid from Thee.

### passuk 11
My heart fluttereth, my strength faileth me; as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.

### passuk 12
My friends and my companions stand aloof from my plague; and my kinsmen stand afar off.

### passuk 13
They also that seek after my life lay snares for me; and they that seek my hurt speak crafty devices, and utter deceits all the day.

### passuk 14
But I am as a deaf man, I hear not; and I am as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.

### passuk 15
Yea, I am become as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no arguments.

### passuk 16
For in Thee, O LORD, do I hope; Thou wilt answer, O Lord my God.

### passuk 17
For I said: 'Lest they rejoice over me; when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.'

### passuk 18
For I am ready to halt, and my pain is continually before me.

### passuk 19
For I do declare mine iniquity; I am full of care because of my sin.

### passuk 20
But mine enemies are strong in health; and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied. 

### passuk 21
They also that repay evil for good are adversaries unto me, because I follow the thing that is good.

### passuk 22
Forsake me not, O LORD; O my God, be not far from me.

### passuk 23
Make haste to help me, O Lord, my salvation.
