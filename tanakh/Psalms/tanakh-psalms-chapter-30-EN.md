### passuk 1
A Psalm; a Song at the Dedication of the House; of David.

### passuk 2
I will extol thee, O LORD, for Thou hast raised me up, and hast not suffered mine enemies to rejoice over me.

### passuk 3
O LORD my God, I cried unto Thee, and Thou didst heal me;

### passuk 4
O LORD, Thou broughtest up my soul from the nether-world; Thou didst kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.

### passuk 5
Sing praise unto the LORD, O ye His godly ones, and give thanks to His holy name.

### passuk 6
For His anger is but for a moment, His favour is for a life-time; weeping may tarry for the night, but joy cometh in the morning.

### passuk 7
Now I had said in my security: 'I shall never be moved.'

### passuk 8
Thou hadst established, O LORD, in Thy favour my mountain as a strongholdâ€” Thou didst hide Thy face; I was affrighted.

### passuk 9
Unto Thee, O LORD, did I call, And unto the LORD I made supplication:

### passuk 10
'What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise Thee? shall it declare Thy truth?

### passuk 11
Hear, O LORD, and be gracious unto me; LORD, be Thou my helper.'

### passuk 12
Thou didst turn for me my mourning into dancing; Thou didst loose my sackcloth, and gird me with gladness;

### passuk 13
So that my glory may sing praise to Thee, and not be silent; O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto Thee for ever.
