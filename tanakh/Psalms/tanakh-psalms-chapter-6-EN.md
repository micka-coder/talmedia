For the Leader; with string-music; on the Sheminith. A Psalm of David.

### passuk 2
O LORD, rebuke me not in Thine anger, Neither chasten me in Thy wrath.

### passuk 3
Be gracious unto me, O LORD, for I languish away; Heal me, O LORD, for my bones are affrighted.

### passuk 4
My soul also is sore affrighted; And Thou, O LORD, how long?

### passuk 5
Return, O LORD, deliver my soul; Save me for Thy mercy's sake.

### passuk 6
For in death there is no remembrance of Thee; In the nether-world who will give Thee thanks?

### passuk 7
I am weary with my groaning; Every night make I my bed to swim; I melt away my couch with my tears.

### passuk 8
Mine eye is dimmed because of vexation; It waxeth old because of all mine adversaries.

### passuk 9
Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; For the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping.

### passuk 10
The LORD hath heard my supplication; The LORD receiveth my prayer.

### passuk 11
All mine enemies shall be ashamed and sore affrighted; They shall turn back, they shall be ashamed suddenly.
