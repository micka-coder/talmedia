### passuk 1
A Psalm of David. O LORD, hear my prayer, give ear to my supplications; In Thy faithfulness answer me, and in Thy righteousness.

### passuk 2
And enter not into judgment with Thy servant; For in Thy sight shall no man living be justified.

### passuk 3
For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; He hath crushed my life down to the ground; He hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead.

### passuk 4
And my spirit fainteth within me; My heart within me is appalled.

### passuk 5
I remember the days of old; I meditate on all Thy doing; I muse on the work of Thy hands.

### passuk 6
I spread forth my hands unto Thee; My soul [thirsteth] after Thee, as a weary land. Selah

### passuk 7
Answer me speedily, O LORD, My spirit faileth; Hide not Thy face from me; Lest I become like them that go down into the pit.

### passuk 8
Cause me to hear Thy lovingkindness in the morning, For in Thee do I trust; Cause me to know the way wherein I should walk, For unto Thee have I lifted up my soul.

### passuk 9
Deliver me from mine enemies, O LORD; With Thee have I hidden myself.

### passuk 10
Teach me to do Thy will, For Thou art my God; Let Thy good spirit Lead me in an even land.

### passuk 11
For Thy name's sake, O LORD, quicken me; In Thy righteousness bring my soul out of trouble.

### passuk 12
And in Thy mercy cut off mine enemies, And destroy all them that harass my soul; For I am Thy servant.
