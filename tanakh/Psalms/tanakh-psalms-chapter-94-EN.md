### passuk 1
O LORD, Thou God to whom vengeance belongeth, Thou God to whom vengeance belongeth, shine forth.

### passuk 2
Lift up Thyself, Thou Judge of the earth; Render to the proud their recompense.

### passuk 3
LORD, how long shall the wicked, How long shall the wicked exult?

### passuk 4
They gush out, they speak arrogancy; All the workers of iniquity bear themselves loftily.

### passuk 5
They crush Thy people, O LORD, And afflict Thy heritage.

### passuk 6
They slay the widow and the stranger, And murder the fatherless.

### passuk 7
And they say: 'The LORD will not see, Neither will the God of Jacob give heed.'

### passuk 8
Consider, ye brutish among the people; And ye fools, when will ye understand?

### passuk 9
He that planted the ear, shall He not hear? He that formed the eye, shall He not see?

### passuk 10
He that instructeth nations, shall not He correct? Even He that teacheth man knowledge?

### passuk 11
The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, That they are vanity.

### passuk 12
Happy is the man whom Thou instructest, O LORD, And teachest out of Thy law;

### passuk 13
That Thou mayest give him rest from the days of evil, Until the pit be digged for the wicked.

### passuk 14
For the LORD will not cast off His people, Neither will He forsake His inheritance.

### passuk 15
For right shall return unto justice, And all the upright in heart shall follow it.

### passuk 16
Who will rise up for me against the evil-doers? Who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?

### passuk 17
Unless the LORD had been my help, My soul had soon dwelt in silence.

### passuk 18
If I say: 'My foot slippeth', Thy mercy, O LORD, holdeth me up.

### passuk 19
When my cares are many within me, Thy comforts delight my soul.

### passuk 20
Shall the seat of wickedness have fellowship with Thee, Which frameth mischief by statute?

### passuk 21
They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, And condemn innocent blood.

### passuk 22
But the LORD hath been my high tower, And my God the rock of my refuge.

### passuk 23
And He hath brought upon them their own iniquity, And will cut them off in their own evil; The LORD our God will cut them off.
