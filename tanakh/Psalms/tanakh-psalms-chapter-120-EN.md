### passuk 1
A Song of Ascents. In my distress I called unto the LORD, And He answered me.

### passuk 2
O LORD, deliver my soul from lying lips, From a deceitful tongue.

### passuk 3
What shall be given unto thee, and what shall be done more unto thee, Thou deceitful tongue?

### passuk 4
Sharp arrows of the mighty, With coals of broom.

### passuk 5
Woe is me, that I sojourn with Meshech, That I dwell beside the tents of Kedar!

### passuk 6
My soul hath full long had her dwelling With him that hateth peace.

### passuk 7
I am all peace; But when I speak, they are for war.
