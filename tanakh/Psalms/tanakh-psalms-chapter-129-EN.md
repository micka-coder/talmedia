### passuk 1
A Song of Ascents. 'Much have they afflicted me from my youth up', Let Israel now say;

### passuk 2
'Much have they afflicted me from my youth up; But they have not prevailed against me.

### passuk 3
The plowers plowed upon my back; They made long their furrows.

### passuk 4
The LORD is righteous; He hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.'

### passuk 5
Let them be ashamed and turned backward, All they that hate Zion.

### passuk 6
Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, Which withereth afore it springeth up;

### passuk 7
Wherewith the reaper filleth not his hand, Nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom.

### passuk 8
Neither do they that go by say: â€˜The blessing of the LORD be upon you; We bless you in the name of the LORD.'
