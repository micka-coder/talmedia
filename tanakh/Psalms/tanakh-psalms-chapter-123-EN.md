### passuk 1
A Song of Ascents. Unto Thee I lift up mine eyes, O Thou that art enthroned in the heavens.

### passuk 2
Behold, as the eyes of servants unto the hand of their master, As the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; So our eyes look unto the LORD our God, Until He be gracious unto us.

### passuk 3
Be gracious unto us, O LORD, be gracious unto us; For we are full sated with contempt.

### passuk 4
Our soul is full sated With the scorning of those that are at ease, And with the contempt of the proud oppressors.
