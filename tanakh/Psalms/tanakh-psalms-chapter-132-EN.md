### passuk 1
A Song of Ascents. LORD, remember unto David All his affliction;

### passuk 2
How he swore unto the LORD, And vowed unto the Mighty One of Jacob:

### passuk 3
â€˜Surely I will not come into the tent of my house, Nor go up into the bed that is spread for me;

### passuk 4
I will not give sleep to mine eyes, Nor slumber to mine eyelids;

### passuk 5
Until I find out a place for the LORD, A dwelling-place for the Mighty One of Jacob.'

### passuk 6
Lo, we heard of it as being in Ephrath; We found it in the field of athe wood.

### passuk 7
Let us go into His dwelling-place; Let us worship at His footstool. .

### passuk 8
Arise, O LORD, unto Thy resting-place; Thou, and the ark of Thy strength.

### passuk 9
Let Thy priests be clothed with righteousness; And let Thy saints shout for joy.

### passuk 10
For Thy servant David's sake Turn not away the face of Thine anointed.

### passuk 11
The LORD swore unto David in truth; He will not turn back from it: 'Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.

### passuk 12
If thy children keep My covenant And My testimony that I shall teach them, Their children also for ever shall sit upon thy throne.'

### passuk 13
For the LORD hath chosen Zion; He hath desired it for His habitation:

### passuk 14
'This is My resting-place for ever; Here will I dwell; for I have desired it.

### passuk 15
I will abundantly bless her provision; I will give her needy bread in plenty.

### passuk 16
Her priests also will I clothe with salvation; And her saints shall shout aloud for joy.

### passuk 17
There will I make a horn to shoot up unto David, There have I ordered a lamp for Mine anointed.

### passuk 18
His enemies will I clothe with shame; But upon himself shall his crown shine.'
