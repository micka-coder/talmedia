### passuk 1
A Psalm, a Song. For the sabbath day.

### passuk 2
It is a good thing to give thanks unto the LORD, And to sing praises unto Thy name, O Most High;

### passuk 3
To declare Thy lovingkindness in the morning, And Thy faithfulness in the night seasons,

### passuk 4
With an instrument of ten strings, and with the psaltery; With a solemn sound upon the harp.

### passuk 5
For Thou, LORD, hast made me glad through Thy work; I will exult in the works of Thy hands.

### passuk 6
How great are Thy works, O LORD! Thy thoughts are very deep.

### passuk 7
A brutish man knoweth not, Neither doth a fool understand this.

### passuk 8
When the wicked spring up as the grass, And when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; It is that they may be destroyed for ever.

### passuk 9
But Thou, O LORD, art on high for evermore.

### passuk 10
For, lo, Thine enemies, O LORD, For, lo, Thine enemies shall perish: All the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.

### passuk 11
But my horn hast Thou exalted like the horn of the wild-ox; I am anointed with rich oil.

### passuk 12
Mine eye also hath gazed on them that lie in wait for me, Mine ears have heard my desire of the evil-doers that rise up against me.

### passuk 13
The righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree; He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.

### passuk 14
Planted in the house of the LORD, They shall flourish in the courts of our God.

### passuk 15
They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; They shall be full of sap and richness;

### passuk 16
To declare that the LORD is upright, My Rock, in whom there is no unrighteousness.
