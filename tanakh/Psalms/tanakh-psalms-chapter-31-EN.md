For the Leader. A Psalm of David.

### passuk 2
In thee, O LORD, have I taken refuge; let me never be ashamed; Deliver me in Thy righteousness.

### passuk 3
Incline Thine ear unto me, deliver me speedily; Be Thou to me a rock of refuge, even a fortress of defence, to save me.

### passuk 4
For Thou art my rock and my fortress; Therefore for Thy name's sake lead me and guide me.

### passuk 5
Bring me forth out of the net that they have hidden for me; For Thou art my stronghold.

### passuk 6
Into Thy hand I commit my spirit; Thou hast redeemed me, O LORD, Thou God of truth.

### passuk 7
I hate them that regard lying vanities; But I trust in the LORD.

### passuk 8
I will be glad and rejoice in Thy lovingkindness; For Thou hast seen mine affliction, Thou hast taken cognizance of the troubles of my soul,

### passuk 9
And Thou hast not given me over into the hand of the enemy; Thou hast set my feet in a broad place.

### passuk 10
Be gracious unto me, O LORD, for I am in distress; Mine eye wasteth away with vexation, yea, my soul and my body.

### passuk 11
For my life is spent in sorrow, and my years in sighing; My strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are wasted away.

### passuk 12
Because of all mine adversaries I am become a reproach, Yea, unto my neighbours exceedingly, and a dread to mine acquaintance; They that see me without flee from me.

### passuk 13
I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind; I am like a useless vessel.

### passuk 14
For I have heard the whispering of many, Terror on every side; While they took counsel together against me, They devised to take away my life.

### passuk 15
But as for me, I have trusted in Thee, O LORD; I have said: 'Thou art my God.'

### passuk 16
My times are in Thy hand; Deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.

### passuk 17
Make Thy face to shine upon Thy servant; Save me in Thy lovingkindness.

### passuk 18
O LORD, let me not be ashamed, for I have called upon Thee; Let the wicked be ashamed, let them be put to silence in the nether-world.

### passuk 19
Let the lying lips be dumb, Which speak arrogantly against the righteous, With pride and contempt.

### passuk 20
Oh how abundant is Thy goodness, which Thou hast laid up for them that fear Thee; Which Thou hast wrought for them that take their refuge in Thee, in the sight of the sons of men!

### passuk 21
Thou hidest them in the covert of Thy presence from the plottings of man; Thou concealest them in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.

### passuk 22
Blessed be the LORD; For He hath shown me His wondrous lovingkindness in an entrenched city.

### passuk 23
As for me, I said in my haste: 'I am cut off from before Thine eyes'; Nevertheless Thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto Thee.

### passuk 24
O love the LORD, all ye His godly ones; The LORD preserveth the faithful, And plentifully repayeth him that acteth haughtily.

### passuk 25
Be strong, and let your heart take courage, All ye that wait for the LORD.
