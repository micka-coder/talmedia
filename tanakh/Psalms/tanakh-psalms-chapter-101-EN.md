A Psalm of David. I will sing of mercy and justice; unto Thee, O LORD, will I sing praises.

### passuk 2
I will give heed unto the way of integrity; oh when wilt Thou come unto me? I will walk within my house in the integrity of my heart.

### passuk 3
I will set no base thing before mine eyes; I hate the doing of things crooked; it shall not cleave unto me.

### passuk 4
A perverse heart shall depart from me; I will know no evil thing.

### passuk 5
Whoso slandereth his neighbour in secret, him will I destroy; Whoso is haughty of eye and proud of heart, him will I not suffer.

### passuk 6
Mine eyes are upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me; he that walketh in a way of integrity, he shall minister unto me.

### passuk 7
He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house; he that speaketh falsehood shall not be established before mine eyes.

### passuk 8
Morning by morning will I destroy all the wicked of the land; to cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of the LORD.
