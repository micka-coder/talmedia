### passuk 1
Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, Thou art very great; Thou art clothed with glory and majesty.

### passuk 2
Who coverest Thyself with light as with a garment, who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain;

### passuk 3
Who layest the beams of Thine upper chambers in the waters, who makest the clouds Thy chariot, who walkest upon the wings of the wind;

### passuk 4
Who makest winds Thy messengers, the flaming fire Thy ministers.

### passuk 5
Who didst establish the earth upon its foundations, that it should not be moved for ever and ever;

### passuk 6
Thou didst cover it with the deep as with a vesture; the waters stood above the mountains.

### passuk 7
At Thy rebuke they fled, at the voice of Thy thunder they hasted away—

### passuk 8
The mountains rose, the valleys sank down— Unto the place which Thou hadst founded for them;

### passuk 9
Thou didst set a bound which they should not pass over, That they might not return to cover the earth.

### passuk 10
Who sendest forth springs into the valleys; They run between the mountains;

### passuk 11
They give drink to every beast of the field, The wild asses quench their thirst. .

### passuk 12
Beside them dwell the fowl of the heaven, From among the branches they sing.

### passuk 13
Who waterest the mountains from Thine upper chambers; The earth is full of the fruit of Thy works.

### passuk 14
Who causeth the grass to spring up for the cattle, And herb for the service of man; To bring forth bread out of the earth,

### passuk 15
And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, Making the face brighter than oil, And bread that stayeth man's heart.

### passuk 16
The trees of the LORD have their fill, The cedars of Lebanon, which He hath planted;

### passuk 17
Wherein the birds make their nests; As for the stork, the fir-trees are her house.

### passuk 18
The high mountains are for the wild goats; The rocks are a refuge for the conies.

### passuk 19
Who appointedst the moon for seasons; The sun knoweth his going down.

### passuk 20
Thou makest darkness, and it is night, Wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth.

### passuk 21
The young lions roar after their prey, And seek their food from God.

### passuk 22
The sun ariseth, they slink away, And couch in their dens.

### passuk 23
Man goeth forth unto his work And to his labour until the evening.

### passuk 24
How manifold are Thy works, O LORD! In wisdom hast Thou made them all; The earth is full of Thy creatures.

### passuk 25
Yonder sea, great and wide, Therein are creeping things innumerable, Living creatures, both small and great.

### passuk 26
There go the ships; There is leviathan, whom Thou hast formed to sport therein.

### passuk 27
All of them wait for Thee, That Thou mayest give them their food in due season.

### passuk 28
Thou givest it unto them, they gather it; Thou openest Thy hand, they are satisfied with good.

### passuk 29
Thou hidest Thy face, they vanish; Thou withdrawest their breath, they perish, And return to their dust.

### passuk 30
Thou sendest forth Thy spirit, they are created; and Thou renewest the face of the earth.

### passuk 31
May the glory of the LORD endure for ever; let the LORD rejoice in His works!

### passuk 32
Who looketh on the earth, and it trembleth; He toucheth the mountains, and they smoke.

### passuk 33
I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live; I will sing praise to my God while I have any being.

### passuk 34
Let my musing be sweet unto Him; as for me, I will rejoice in the LORD.

### passuk 35
Let sinners cease out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless the LORD, O my soul. Hallelujah.
