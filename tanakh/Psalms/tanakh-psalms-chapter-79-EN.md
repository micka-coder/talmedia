### passuk 1
A Psalm of Asaph. O God, the heathen are come into Thine inheritance; They have defiled Thy holy temple; They have made Jerusalem into heaps.

### passuk 2
They have given the dead bodies of Thy servants to be food unto the fowls of the heaven, The flesh of Thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.

### passuk 3
They have shed their blood like water Round about Jerusalem, with none to bury them.

### passuk 4
We are become a taunt to our neighbours, A scorn and derision to them that are round about us.

### passuk 5
How long, O LORD, wilt Thou be angry for ever? How long will Thy jealousy burn like fire?

### passuk 6
Pour out Thy wrath upon the nations that know Thee not, And upon the kingdoms that call not upon Thy name.

### passuk 7
For they have devoured Jacob, And laid waste his habitation.

### passuk 8
Remember not against us the iniquities of our forefathers; Let Thy compassions speedily come to meet us; For we are brought very low.

### passuk 9
Help us, O God of our salvation, for the sake of the glory of Thy name; And deliver us, and forgive our sins, for Thy name's sake.

### passuk 10
Wherefore should the nations say: 'Where is their God?' Let the avenging of Thy servants' blood that is shed Be made known among the nations in our sight. .

### passuk 11
Let the groaning of the prisoner come before Thee; According to the greatness of Thy power set free those that are appointed to death;

### passuk 12
And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom Their reproach, wherewith they have reproached Thee, O Lord.

### passuk 13
So we that are Thy people and the flock of Thy pasture Will give Thee thanks for ever; We will tell of Thy praise to all generations.
