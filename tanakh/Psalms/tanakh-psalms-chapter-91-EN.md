### passuk 1
O thou that dwellest in the covert of the Most High, And abidest in the shadow of the Almighty;

### passuk 2
I will say of the LORD, who is my refuge and my fortress, My God, in whom I trust,

### passuk 3
That He will deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, And from the noisome pestilence.

### passuk 4
He will cover thee with His pinions, And under His wings shalt thou take refuge; His truth is a shield and a buckler.

### passuk 5
Thou shalt not be afraid of the terror by night, Nor of the arrow that flieth by day;

### passuk 6
Of the pestilence that walketh in darkness, Nor of the destruction that wasteth at noonday.

### passuk 7
A thousand may fall at Thy side, And ten thousand at Thy right hand; It shall not come nigh thee.

### passuk 8
Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold, And see the recompense of the wicked.

### passuk 9
For thou hast made the LORD who is my refuge, Even the Most High, thy habitation.

### passuk 10
There shall no evil befall thee, Neither shall any plague come nigh thy tent.

### passuk 11
For He will give His angels charge over thee, To keep thee in all thy ways.

### passuk 12
They shall bear thee upon their hands, Lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.

### passuk 13
Thou shalt tread upon the lion and asp; The young lion and the serpent shalt thou trample under feet.

### passuk 14
'Because he hath set his love upon Me, therefore will I deliver him; I will set him on high, because he hath known My name.

### passuk 15
He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will rescue him, and bring him to honour.

### passuk 16
With long life will I satisfy him, And make Him to behold My salvation.'
