### passuk 1
For the Leader. A Psalm of David.

### passuk 2
Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint; preserve my life from the terror of the enemy.

### passuk 3
Hide me from the council of evil-doers; from the tumult of the workers of iniquity;

### passuk 4
Who have whet their tongue like a sword, and have aimed their arrow, a poisoned word;

### passuk 5
That they may shoot in secret places at the blameless; suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.

### passuk 6
They encourage one another in an evil matter; they converse of laying snares secretly; they ask, who would see them.

### passuk 7
They search out iniquities, they have accomplished a diligent search; even in the inward thought of every one, and the deep heart.

### passuk 8
But God doth shoot at them with an arrow suddenly; thence are their wounds.

### passuk 9
So they make their own tongue a stumbling unto themselves; all that see them shake the head.

### passuk 10
And all men fear; and they declare the work of God, and understand His doing.

### passuk 11
The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall take refuge in Him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.
