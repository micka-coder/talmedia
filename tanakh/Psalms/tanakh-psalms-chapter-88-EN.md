A Song, a Psalm of the sons of Korah; for the Leader; upon Mahalath Leannoth. Maschil of Heman the Ezrahite.

### passuk 2
O LORD, God of my salvation, What time I cry in the night before Thee,

### passuk 3
Let my prayer come before Thee, Incline Thine ear unto my cry.

### passuk 4
For my soul is sated with troubles, And my life draweth nigh unto the grave.

### passuk 5
I am counted with them that go down into the pit; I am become as a man that hath no help;

### passuk 6
Set apart among the dead, Like the slain that lie in the grave, Whom Thou rememberest no more; And they are cut off from Thy hand. .

### passuk 7
Thou hast laid me in the nether-most pit, In dark places, in the deeps.

### passuk 8
Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, And all Thy waves Thou pressest down. Selah

### passuk 9
Thou hast put mine acquaintance far from me; Thou hast made me an abomination unto them; I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.

### passuk 10
Mine eye languisheth by reason of affliction; I have called upon Thee, O LORD, every day, I have spread forth my hands unto Thee.

### passuk 11
Wilt Thou work wonders for the dead? Or shall the shades arise and give Thee thanks? Selah

### passuk 12
Shall Thy mercy be declared in the grave? Or Thy faithfulness in destruction?

### passuk 13
Shall Thy wonders be known in the dark? And Thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?

### passuk 14
But as for me, unto Thee, O LORD, do I cry, And in the morning doth my prayer come to meet Thee.

### passuk 15
LORD, why castest Thou off my soul? Why hidest Thou Thy face from me?

### passuk 16
I am afflicted and at the point of death from my youth up; I have borne Thy terrors, I am distracted.

### passuk 17
Thy fierce wrath is gone over me; Thy terrors have cut me off.

### passuk 18
They came round about me like water all the day; They compassed me about together.

### passuk 19
Friend and companion hast Thou put far from me, And mine acquaintance into darkness.
