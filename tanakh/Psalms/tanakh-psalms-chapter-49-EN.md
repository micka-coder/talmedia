### passuk 1
For the Leader; a Psalm for the sons of Korah.

### passuk 2
Hear this, all ye peoples; Give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world,

### passuk 3
Both low and high, Rich and poor together.

### passuk 4
My mouth shall speak wisdom, and the meditation of my heart shall be understanding.

### passuk 5
I will incline mine ear to a parable; I will open my dark saying upon the harp.

### passuk 6
Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my supplanters compasseth me about,

### passuk 7
Of them that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches?

### passuk 8
No man can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him—

### passuk 9
For too costly is the redemption of their soul, and must be let alone for ever—

### passuk 10
That he should still live always, that he should not see the pit.

### passuk 11
For he seeth that wise men die, The fool and the brutish together perish, And leave their wealth to others.

### passuk 12
Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, And their dwelling-places to all generations; They call their lands after their own names.

### passuk 13
But man abideth not in honour; He is like the beasts that perish.

### passuk 14
This is the way of them that are foolish, and of those who after them approve their sayings. Selah

### passuk 15
Like sheep they are appointed for the nether-world; death shall be their shepherd; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; And their form shall be for the nether-world to wear away, That there be no habitation for it.

### passuk 16
But God will redeem my soul from the power of the nether-world; For He shall receive me. Selah

### passuk 17
Be not thou afraid when one waxeth rich, When the wealth of his house is increased;

### passuk 18
For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away; His wealth shall not descend after him.

### passuk 19
Though while he lived he blessed his soul: 'Men will praise thee, when thou shalt do well to thyself';

### passuk 20
It shall go to the generation of his fathers; They shall never see the light. .

### passuk 21
Man that is in honour understandeth not; He is like the beasts that perish.
