### passuk 1
I love that the LORD should hear my voice and my supplications.

### passuk 2
Because He hath inclined His ear unto me, Therefore will I call upon Him all my days.

### passuk 3
The cords of death compassed me, And the straits of the nether-world got hold upon me; I found trouble and sorrow.

### passuk 4
But I called upon the name of the LORD: 'I beseech thee, O LORD, deliver my soul.'

### passuk 5
Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; Yea, our God is compassionate.

### passuk 6
The LORD preserveth the simple; I was brought low, and He saved me.

### passuk 7
Return, O my soul, unto Thy rest; For the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee.

### passuk 8
For thou hast delivered my soul from death, Mine eyes from tears, And my feet from stumbling.

### passuk 9
I shall walk before the LORD In the lands of the living.

### passuk 10
I trusted even when I spoke: 'I am greatly afflicted.'

### passuk 11
I said in my haste: 'All men are liars.'

### passuk 12
How can I repay unto the LORD All His bountiful dealings toward me?

### passuk 13
I will lift up the cup of salvation, And call upon the name of the LORD.

### passuk 14
My vows will I pay unto the LORD, Yea, in the presence of all His people.

### passuk 15
Precious in the sight of the LORD Is the death of His saints.

### passuk 16
I beseech Thee, O LORD, for I am Thy servant; I am Thy servant, the son of Thy handmaid; Thou hast loosed my bands.

### passuk 17
I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, And will call upon the name of the LORD.

### passuk 18
I will pay my vows unto the LORD, Yea, in the presence of all His people;

### passuk 19
In the courts of the LORDâ€™S house, In the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Hallelujah.
