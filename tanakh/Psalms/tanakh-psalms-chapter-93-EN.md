The LORD reigneth; He is clothed in majesty; The LORD is clothed, He hath girded Himself with strength; Yea, the world is established, that it cannot be moved.

### passuk 2
Thy throne is established of old; Thou art from everlasting.

### passuk 3
The floods have lifted up, O LORD, The floods have lifted up their voice; The floods lift up their roaring.

### passuk 4
Above the voices of many waters, The mighty breakers of the sea, The LORD on high is mighty.

### passuk 5
Thy testimonies are very sure, Holiness becometh Thy house, O LORD, for evermore.
