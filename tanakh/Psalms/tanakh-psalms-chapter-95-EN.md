### passuk 1
O come, let us sing unto the LORD; Let us shout for joy to the Rock of our salvation.

### passuk 2
Let us come before His presence with thanksgiving, Let us shout for joy unto Him with psalms.

### passuk 3
For the LORD is a great God, And a great King above all gods;

### passuk 4
In whose hand are the depths of the earth; The heights of the mountains are His also.

### passuk 5
The sea is His, and He made it; And His hands formed the dry land.

### passuk 6
O come, let us bow down and bend the knee; Let us kneel before the LORD our Maker;

### passuk 7
For He is our God, And we are the people of His pasture, and the flock of His hand. To-day, if ye would but hearken to His voice!

### passuk 8
'Harden not your heart, as at Meribah, As in the day of Massah in the wilderness;

### passuk 9
When your fathers tried Me, Proved Me, even though they saw My work.

### passuk 10
For forty years was I wearied with that generation, And said: It is a people that do err in their heart, And they have not known My ways;

### passuk 11
Wherefore I swore in My wrath, That they should not enter into My arest.'
