For the Leader. A Psalm of David. O God of my praise, keep not silence;

### passuk 2
For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit have they opened against me; They have spoken unto me with a lying tongue.

### passuk 3
They compassed me about also with words of hatred, And fought against me without a cause.

### passuk 4
In return for my love they are my adversaries; But I am all prayer.

### passuk 5
And they have laid upon me evil for good, And hatred for my love:

### passuk 6
â€™Set Thou a wicked man over him; And let an adversary stand at his right hand.

### passuk 7
When he is judged, let him go forth condemned; And let his prayer be turned into sin.

### passuk 8
Let his days be few; Let another take his charge.

### passuk 9
Let his children be fatherless, And his wife a widow.

### passuk 10
Let his children be vagabonds, and beg; And let them seek their bread out of their desolate places.

### passuk 11
Let the creditor distrain all that he hath; And let strangers make spoil of his labour.

### passuk 12
Let there be none to extend kindness unto him; Neither let there be any to be gracious unto his fatherless children.

### passuk 13
Let his posterity be cut off; In the generation following let their name be blotted out.

### passuk 14
Let the iniquity of his fathers be brought to remembrance unto the LORD; And let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.

### passuk 15
Let them be before the LORD continually, That He may cut off the memory of them from the earth.

### passuk 16
Because that he remembered not to do kindness, But persecuted the poor and needy man, And the broken in heart he was ready to slay.

### passuk 17
Yea, he loved cursing, and it came unto him; And he delighted not in blessing, and it is far from him.

### passuk 18
He clothed himself also with cursing as with his raiment, And it is come into his inward parts like water, And like oil into his bones.

### passuk 19
Let it be unto him as the garment which he putteth on, And for the girdle wherewith he is girded continually.'

### passuk 20
This would mine adversaries effect from the LORD, And they that speak evil against my soul.

### passuk 21
But Thou, O GOD the Lord, deal with me for Thy name's sake; Because Thy mercy is good, deliver Thou me.

### passuk 22
For I am poor and needy, And my heart is wounded within me.

### passuk 23
I am gone like the shadow when it lengtheneth; I am shaken off as the locust.

### passuk 24
My knees totter through fasting; And my flesh is lean, and hath no fatness.

### passuk 25
I am become also a taunt unto them; When they see me, they shake their head.

### passuk 26
Help me, O LORD my God; O save me according to Thy mercy;

### passuk 27
That they may know that this is Thy hand; That Thou, LORD, hast done it.

### passuk 28
Let them curse, but bless Thou; When they arise, they shall be put to shame, but Thy servant shall rejoice.

### passuk 29
Mine adversaries shall be clothed with confusion, And shall put on their own shame as a robe.

### passuk 30
I will give great thanks unto the LORD with my mouth; Yea, I will praise Him among the multitude;

### passuk 31
Because He standeth at the right hand of the needy, To save him from them that judge his soul.
