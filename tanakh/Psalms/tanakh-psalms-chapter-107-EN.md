### passuk 1
'O give thanks unto the LORD, for He is good, For His mercy endureth for ever.'

### passuk 2
So let the redeemed of the LORD say, Whom He hath redeemed from the hand of the adversary;

### passuk 3
And gathered them out of the lands, From the east and from the west, From the north and from the sea.

### passuk 4
They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way; They found no city of habitation.

### passuk 5
Hungry and thirsty, Their soul fainted in them.

### passuk 6
Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, And He delivered them out of their distresses.

### passuk 7
And He led them by a straight way, That they might go to a city of habitation.

### passuk 8
Let them give thanks unto the LORD for His mercy, And for His wonderful works to the children of men!

### passuk 9
For He hath satisfied the longing soul, And the hungry soul He hath filled with good.

### passuk 10
Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, Being bound in affliction and iron—

### passuk 11
Because they rebelled against the words of God, And contemned the counsel of the Most High.

### passuk 12
Therefore He humbled their heart with travail, They stumbled, and there was none to help—

### passuk 13
They cried unto the LORD in their trouble, And He saved them out of their distresses.

### passuk 14
He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, And broke their bands in sunder. .

### passuk 15
Let them give thanks unto the LORD for His mercy, And for His wonderful works to the children of men!

### passuk 16
For He hath broken the gates of brass, And cut the bars of iron in sunder.

### passuk 17
Crazed because of the way of their transgression, And afflicted because of their iniquities—

### passuk 18
Their soul abhorred all manner of food, And they drew near unto the gates of death—

### passuk 19
They cried unto the LORD in their trouble, And He saved them out of their distresses;

### passuk 20
He sent His word, and healed them, And delivered them from their graves.

### passuk 21
Let them give thanks unto the LORD for His mercy, And for His wonderful works to the children of men!

### passuk 22
And let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving, And declare His works with singing.

### passuk 23
They that go down to the sea in ships, That do business in great waters—

### passuk 24
These saw the works of the LORD, And His wonders in the deep;

### passuk 25
For He commanded, and raised the stormy wind, Which lifted up the waves thereof;

### passuk 26
They mounted up to the heaven, they went down to the deeps; Their soul melted away because of trouble;

### passuk 27
They reeled to and fro, and staggered like a drunken man, And all their wisdom was swallowed up—

### passuk 28
They cried unto the LORD in their trouble, And He brought them out of their distresses.

### passuk 29
He made the storm a calm, So that the waves thereof were still.

### passuk 30
Then were they glad because they were quiet, And He led them unto their desired haven.

### passuk 31
Let them give thanks unto the LORD for His mercy, And for His wonderful works to the children of men!

### passuk 32
Let them exalt Him also in the assembly of the people, And praise Him in the seat of the elders.

### passuk 33
He turneth rivers into a wilderness, And watersprings into a thirsty ground;

### passuk 34
A fruitful land into a salt waste, For the wickedness of them that dwell therein.

### passuk 35
He turneth a wilderness into a pool of water, And a dry land into watersprings.

### passuk 36
And there He maketh the hungry to dwell, And they establish a city of habitation;

### passuk 37
And sow fields, and plant vineyards, Which yield fruits of increase.

### passuk 38
He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly, And suffereth not their cattle to decrease.

### passuk 39
Again, they are minished and dwindle away Through oppression of evil and sorrow.

### passuk 40
He poureth contempt upon princes, And causeth them to wander in the waste, where there is no way.

### passuk 41
Yet setteth He the needy on high from affliction, And maketh his families like a flock.

### passuk 42
The upright see it, and are glad; And all iniquity stoppeth her mouth.

### passuk 43
Whoso is wise, let him observe these things, And let them consider the mercies of the LORD.
