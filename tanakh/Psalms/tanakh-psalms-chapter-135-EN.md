### passuk 1
Hallelujah. Praise ye the name of the LORD; Give praise, O ye servants of the LORD,

### passuk 2
Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, In the courts of the house of our God.

### passuk 3
Praise ye the LORD, for the LORD is good; Sing praises unto His name, for it is pleasant.

### passuk 4
For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto Himself, And Israel for His own treasure.

### passuk 5
For I know that the LORD is great, And that our Lord is above all gods.

### passuk 6
Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that hath He done, In heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps;

### passuk 7
Who causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; He maketh lightnings for the rain; He bringeth forth the wind out of His treasuries.

### passuk 8
Who smote the first-born of Egypt, Both of man and beast.

### passuk 9
He sent signs and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, Upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.

### passuk 10
Who smote many nations, And slew mighty kings:

### passuk 11
Sihon king of the Amorites, And Og king of Bashan, And all the kingdoms of Canaan;

### passuk 12
And gave their land for a heritage, A heritage unto Israel His people.

### passuk 13
O LORD, Thy name endureth for ever; Thy memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations.

### passuk 14
For the LORD will judge His people, And repent Himself for His servants.

### passuk 15
The idols of the nations are silver and gold, The work of men's hands.

### passuk 16
They have mouths, but they speak not; Eyes have they, but they see not;

### passuk 17
They have ears, but they hear not; Neither is there any breath in their mouths.

### passuk 18
They that make them shall be like unto them; Yea, every one that trusteth in them.

### passuk 19
O house of Israel, bless ye the LORD; O house of Aaron, bless ye the LORD;

### passuk 20
O house of Levi, bless ye the LORD; Ye that fear the LORD, bless ye the LORD.

### passuk 21
Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, Who dwelleth at Jerusalem. Hallelujah.
