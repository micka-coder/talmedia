For the Leader. [A Psalm] of David; to make memorial.

### passuk 2
O God, to deliver me, O LORD, to help me, make haste.

### passuk 3
Let them be ashamed and abashed That seek after my soul; Let them be turned backward and brought to confusion That delight in my hurt.

### passuk 4
Let them be turned back by reason of their shame That say: 'Aha, aha.'

### passuk 5
Let all those that seek Thee rejoice and be glad in Thee; And let such as love Thy salvation say continually: 'Let God be magnified.'

### passuk 6
But I am poor and needy; O God, make haste unto me; Thou art my help and my deliverer; O LORD, tarry not.
