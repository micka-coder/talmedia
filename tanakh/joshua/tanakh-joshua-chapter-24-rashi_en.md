<b>I multiplied his descendants.</b> The word אַרְבֶּ in the text lacks the letter ה,<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">The word should have been written אַרְבֶּה.</i> [from which we infer:]<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote"> The root of ארב would be רִיב which means to quarrel.</i> “How many troubles and tests<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">Avrohom was tested a total of 10 times, the tenth being the binding of Yitchok on the altar.</i> did I bring upon him before I gave him a descendant.”

<b>And He brought the sea upon “him.”</b><sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">Why is the singular עָלָיו, upon him used in the text? Rashi goes on to explain its significance.</i> He brought the sea upon each individual among them. If it happened that one of them ran away, in order not to enter the sea, a sea-wave would pursue him and catch him.

<b>The people of Yericho went to war against you.

Therefore, all these seven nations were gathered there, represented by their elite soldiers.

<b>A holy God.</b><sup>6</sup><i class="footnote">Why is this Name of God always in the plural form אל־הים instead of א־ל.</i> In most places, every expression of rulership is found in the plural form, such as: “the ruler of the Land,”<sup>7</sup><i class="footnote"> Bereishis 42:30. “The <i>man</i> the <i>master</i> of the land,  אַדנֵי הָאָרֶץ spoke to us.” Here too, it should have been written  אַדוֹן הָאֶָרֶץ in the singular.</i> “the ruler of Yoseif,”<sup>8</sup><i class="footnote">Bereishes 39:20.</i> “if his master is with him,”<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote"> Shemos 22:14. Here too it should have said אִם בַּעַל עִמוֹ in the singular referring to the owner.</i> that God went to redeem<sup>10</sup><i class="footnote">II Shmuel 7:23.</i>. The reason for this is because this name is the name of power.

<b>You are witnesses against yourselves.</b> Yehoshua foresaw that in the future, they would undermine [the covenant] in the days of Yechezkeil and say, “We want to be like the [other] nations,” and therefore he was so hard on them now. Therefore it was said to them in the days of Yechezkeil, “The thought you entertain will never come to pass etc., As I live says Adonoy, God, I will rule over you with a strong hand etc.”<sup>11</sup><i class="footnote"> See Yechezkeil 20:32,33.</i> You have already accepted upon yourselves [the covenant] in the days of Yehoshua. And you can not say “We only accepted it upon ourselves in the days of Moshe because we wanted [God’s help] to enter the land,” since in the days of Yehoshua you had already entered the land, and [yet] you accepted the covenant.

<b>And he established it as a statute and an ordinance at Shechem.</b> He set in order for them there the statutes of the Torah and they accepted them upon themselves.

<b>And Yehoshua wrote, etc.</b><sup>12</sup><i class="footnote">What were the words that Yehoshua wrote and where did he write them? It might be inferred that he wrote the words of his admonishment to the people and inserted them in the Sefer Torah of Moshe, but we know this is not true.</i> According to Targum Yonasan— And Yehoshua wrote these words, and concealed them in the Sefer Torah of God.<sup>13</sup><i class="footnote">According to Targum Yonasan, He merely placed them where the Sefer Torah was kept, which was in the Ark.</i> In Maseches Makos,<sup>14</sup><i class="footnote"> 11a.</i> two <i>Amoraim</i> argue [about what Yehoshua wrote]. One says that it refers to the eight verses from ‘And Moshe died’ until ‘in view of all of Yisroel,’ for the Sefer Torah was incomplete and he [Yehoshua] completed it.<sup>15</sup><i class="footnote">See Devorim 34:5-12. These verses describe the passing of Moshe. Could Moshe have written them himself? How could he have written them while he was alive when they were not yet true? Moshe could not have written that he had died when it had not yet happened. This <i>Amora</i> says therefore that the final eight verses were written by Yehoshua.</i> The other one says that this refers to the chapter of the cities of refuge<sup>16</sup><i class="footnote">See above, Chapter 20.</i> which he wrote in his book [Sefer Yehoshua] as they were written in the Sefer Torah.
<b>Under the doorpost.</b> This is translated according to Targum Yonasan, תְּחוֹת אַלְתָא. הָאַלָה refers to the door post of the entrance, as it is said,<sup>17</sup><i class="footnote">I. Melachim 6:31.</i> “the doorposts were a fifth, and<sup>18</sup><i class="footnote">Yechezkeil 40:10.</i> the doorposts had one measure.” Other say that [הָאַלָה means ‘the oak tree’] and it refers to the oak near Shechem which is written regarding Yaakov,<sup>19</sup><i class="footnote">See Bereishis 35:4. As Yaakov was preparing to return to his father, Yitzchok, in the Holy Land, he instructed that all idols and earrings were to be given to him and he buried them under the oak tree near Shechem.</i> “And Yaakov hid them beneath the oak.”
<b>Which is in the Sanctuary of Adonoy.</b><sup>20</sup><i class="footnote">But the Sanctuary had not yet been built.</i> Since the Ark was brought there [it is referred to as the Sanctuary] as it stated above,<sup>21</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 1.</i> ‘And they stood before God.

<b>Behold this stone will be witness against us, etc.</b><sup>22</sup><i class="footnote">The question is, how could the stone hear? Another problem: the verse states that it heard “all the words of Adonoy that He spoke to us,” and yet there is no mention of Adonoy having spoken to them.</i> [Here Rashi quotes from Targum Yonasan]: This stone will be for us as the two stone tablets of the covenant,<sup>23</sup><i class="footnote">Yehoshua compared it to the two tablets of the Ten Commandments which were witness to the covenant at Mount Sinai, and are therefore always referred to as the לוּחוֹת הָעֵדוּת, the Tablets of Testimony.</i> for we have made it for a witness,<sup>24</sup><i class="footnote">It would stand as a silent witness to the covenant they had made on that day.</i> since the words written on it [the stone] are almost similar to all the words of God that He spoke to us. This verse can also be explained according to its plain meaning: for it [the stone] has heard the words that I have spoken to you, on behalf of the Omnipresent.

<b>In Simnas-serach.</b> This was its actual name. Elsewhere it is called Simnas-cheres<sup>25</sup><i class="footnote">See Shoftim 2:9.</i> because they erected a figure of the sun upon his grave,<sup>26</sup><i class="footnote">See Shoftim 8:13 where חָרֶס refers to the sun. Also See Shoftim 14:18.</i> to indicate that he is the one that caused the sun to stand still, and all who pass by it say, “Woe for the loss of this one, who did such a great thing and died.” Others say its <i>actual</i> name was Simnas-cheres, and why was it called Simnas- serach? because its fruit would rot because of their abundant richness.
<b>The Storming Mountain</b> It was so named to teach us that the hill stormed [shook] and threatened to kill them, because the people did not eulogize him properly.<sup>27</sup><i class="footnote">The verse merely states that “they buried him” and no mention is made of them having eulogized him, or mourned for him.</i>

<b>In the hill of his son, Pinchos.</b><sup>29</sup><i class="footnote">These words seem to imply that the hill belonged to Pinchos even during his father’s lifetime. But if he did not inherit it from Elozor, from where could he have gotten it? There are others who say that Pinchos did inherit the land from Elozor, and since inheritance takes effect immediately, it already belonged to Pinchos before Elozor was buried.</i> From where did Pinchos have a portion in the land? He inherited it from his wife.
