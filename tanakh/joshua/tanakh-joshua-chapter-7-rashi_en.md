<b>We should have been content.</b> We should have decided to dwell on the eastern side of the Jordan, in the land of Sichon and Og which has already been captured.

### passuk 9
<b>And what will you do for Your Name, which is associated with our name?<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">God’s Name, אֵל is part of our name יִשְׂרָאֵל.</i></b> This is the Aggadic interpretation. The simple meaning is, What will you do for your mighty Name, that has already achieved such fame; and now they will be able to say, His strength has become lessened.

### passuk 10
<b>Get yourself up.</b> [Even though we read the word as קֻם], it is written קם [which could be read קָם]. [The explanation therefore would be as follows]: Your prayers to Me have stood up for you, and [everything] you mentioned.<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">Your prayers and everything you said have accomplished their purpose. I will not permit the people to be defeated.</i> Another explanation: you stood yourself in the camp and did not go out with them,<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">When you sent the men to capture the city of Ai, you remained at the camp and did not lead them.</i> and I had said, ‘Who will take them out [to war] and who will bring them [back].’<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote">Bamidbar 27:17.</i> ‘For you will bring the Bnei Yisroel— and I will be with you.’<sup>6</sup><i class="footnote">Devorim 31:23.</i> ‘For he will cross over before this people, and he will spur them on to inherit.’<sup>7</sup><i class="footnote">Devorim 3:28.</i> If you go before them, they will succeed, and if not, they will not succeed. Another explanation: Get <i>yourself</i> up, it is your fault [because of you] that this has happened to them. I did not tell you to sanctify the booty of the city.

<b>Households.</b> In one family grouping there can be many individual households. 
<b>Men</b> Individualy, man by man. Each man of the household was to come to the choosing of lots.

### passuk 15
<b>Burned with fire.</b> His tent and movable property [shall be burned].
<b>He and all that he possesses.</b> [This should be understood] according to the law explained below— he and his livestock [are put to death] by stoning.<sup>8</sup><i class="footnote">See below v. 25.</i> The <i>zakeif</i> accent, appearing over the word, בָּאֵשׁ indicates that the word בָּאֵשׁ (with fire) is separated from the word אוֹתוֹ, (he). We find other verses in which the accent divides the verse, such as, ‘אַחַרֵי דֶרֶך מְבוֹא הַשֶׁמֶשׁ’<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote">Devorim 11:30. See Rashi and Sifsei Chachomim there.</i> (Far past the Jordan, the direction in which the sun sets). The word אַחַרֵי is separated from the word דֶרֶך by virtue of the [<i>pashta</i>] accent. Thus the interpretation of our verse is: He who is convicted [by the Ark] because of his taking of the condemned, shall be burned with fire, [which means] that which is fit to be burned [shall be burned], as is explained below.<sup>10</sup><i class="footnote">V. 25.</i>
<b>He and all that he possesses.</b> [This should be understood.] According to the law explained below.<sup>11</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i> This is an abbreviated verse, and there is a similar verse to it: ‘Whoever strikes the Jebusites and reaches the tower.’<sup>12</sup><i class="footnote">II Shmuel 5:8.</i> The verse does not explain what will be done to him,<sup>13</sup><i class="footnote">We are not told what reward will be given to the one who reaches the tower.</i> but in Sefer Divrei Ha Yomim,<sup>14</sup><i class="footnote">I Divrei Hayumim 11:5.</i> it is explained ‘that he will become a leader.’ Here too, it is not explained what will be done to him ‘and to all that he possesses,’ but everything is explained below.<sup>15</sup><i class="footnote">V. 25.</i>

### passuk 16
<b>And brought the Bnei Yisroel near.</b> He brought them in front of the <i>Choshen</i><sup>16</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Choshen</i> was one of the sacred garments worn by the <i>Kohen Gadol.</i> The Divine decisions were given through the letters inscribed on the <i>Choshen.</i></i> on which the names of the tribes were inscribed. The Holy One, blessed is He, gave him a sign— the stone of the sinning tribe will fade, and the stone inscribed with Yehudah’s name, faded.

### passuk 17
<b>And when he brought near the family of Yehudah.</b> To the initial casting of lots he brought the heads of families near, one man from each family, and they cast lots [to see] on whom it would fall. Afterwards lots were cast on each household— one man from each household came to the casting of lots, and then came all the men of that particular household.

### passuk 18

### passuk 19
<b>I beseech you, give honor.</b> Ochan began to defame the casting of lots.<sup>17</sup><i class="footnote">As a means of establishing guilt.</i> He said to Yehoshua, “On the basis of casting lots, Are you accusing me? You and Elozer, the <i>Kohen,</i> are the greatest of the generation. If a lot was cast between you, it would certainly fall on one of you.”<sup>18</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore lots are not a definitive method of reaching a decision.</i> Yehoshua then said to him, ‘I beseech you, give honor, (etc).’ “I ask you, please do not defame the method of casting lots, for this is the way the land will ultimately be divided.”<sup>19</sup><i class="footnote">You are therefore casting doubt on the division of the land.</i>

### passuk 20
<b>And Ochan answered.</b> He saw the men of [the tribe of] Yehudah assembling for war,<sup>20</sup><i class="footnote">They were prepared to go to war to protect Ochan, who was one of their tribe.</i> and he said, “It is better that I alone should die rather than have many thousands of Bnei Yisroel killed.”<sup>21</sup><i class="footnote">There would have been a civil war between the tribe of Yehudah and the other tribes. This would have caused thousands of casualties.</i>
<b>And I have done the following.</b> (Lit. and this and this have I done)<sup>22</sup><i class="footnote">The implication was that this was not the only time he had sinned regarding sacred things.</i> I also sinned regarding other sacred things, during the days of Moshe, as it is said, ‘I will sanctify their cities.’<sup>23</sup><i class="footnote">Bamidbar 21:2. This occurred when the Bnei Yisroel took revenge against Midian and declared that some of the booty be considered sacred.</i>

### passuk 21
<b>I saw amidst the spoils</b>—I gave thought to what is written in the Torah,<sup>24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rashi</i> understands וָאֵרֶה as referring to intellectual comprehension.</i> ‘and you shall consume, [the booty] etc.’<sup>25</sup><i class="footnote">Devorim 20:14. Ochan took this verse as a command to consume the booty captured from the enemy.</i>
<b>A Babylonian garment.</b> This is translated according to the Targum. Any king who did not possess a palace in Eretz Yisroel, was not content with his kingship, as it is said, ‘And I will give you a desired land, and inheritance desired by many nations.’<sup>26</sup><i class="footnote">Yirmiahu 3:19. The verse obviously refers to Eretz Yisroel, which is the land desired many kings.</i> The king of Babylonia had a palace in Yericho, and when he visited here he would wear them.<sup>27</sup><i class="footnote">This explains how a Babylonian garment was found in Yericho.</i>

### passuk 22
<b>And they ran to [his] tent.</b> They wanted to get there before the tribe of Yehudah had a chance to remove the articles and deny the accuracy of the lots.

### passuk 23
<b>And they spread them out.</b> The Targum renders וַיַצִקָם as וְאַתִּיכוּנוּן [which implies, and they melted them] Our Sages said, ‘He [Yehoshua] came and cast them before the Omnipresent. He said before him, “Master of the universe, for these, shall the bulk of Sanhedrin fall?’”<sup>28</sup><i class="footnote">Because of these insignificant items, will You punish them.</i>

### passuk 24
<b>His sons etc., and all of Yisroel.</b><sup>29</sup><i class="footnote">Why was it necessary to bring all of Yisroel? Rashi therefore explains—to witness his downfall.</i> To witness his downfall, and to be forewarned against doing as he did.
<b>His ox(en) and his mule(s)</b> to destroy them, as it was said, ‘And he who is convicted by [his guilt in taking of] the sacred things, shall be burned with fire, he and all that he possesses.’<sup>30</sup><i class="footnote">See Verse 15 above, and Rashi’s commentary there.</i>

### passuk 25
<b>And [they] stoned him.</b><sup>31</sup><i class="footnote">Why this particular death? Rashi answers. he desecrated the Shabbos.</i> He had desecrated the Shabbos.
<b>And they burned them.</b> This refers to the tent, and all other movable objects.
<b>And they stoned them.</b> This refers to the ox(en) and other animals.
