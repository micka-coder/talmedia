### passuk 1
<b>Who were on the western side of the Jordan.</b> On the side to which Bnei Yisroel crossed, which is the western side, since they had been on the eastern side.

### passuk 2
<b>Sharp knives.</b> As translated by Targum, sharp knives. Similarly, ‘You also turned back the sharp edge of his sword.’<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim 89:44.</i> When the sharp edge is turned sideways it does not cut well. ‘Similarly, ‘Every weapon that is sharpened against you?’<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshayahu 54.</i>
<b>The second time.</b> For there had already been a circumcision— on the night of their departure from Egypt a large assembly were collectively circumcised, and this was the second time; because during the entire forty years that they were in the wilderness the north wind did not blow for them, and they did not have a suitable day to circumcise themselves, as we learned in <i>Maseches Yevamos.</i><sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">Yevomos 71b. Certain atmospheric conditions were beneficial for the healing of the wound caused by circumcision. The north wind created this condition. These winds were withheld during the forty years in the wilderners in order that the “Clouds of Glory” that led and protected the people would not disperse.</i> Our Sages said, “The second time refers to exposing the corona at circumcision. [This particular aspect of circumcision] was not commanded to our Patriarch, Avrohom.

### passuk 3
<b>Gival Ha-orlos.</b> [Lit. Hill of the foreskins] It was so called, because of the event, [i.e., the mass of foreskins that were circumcised] which were made into a hill.

### passuk 4
<b>And this is the reason.</b> [Lit. and this is the thing] After this speech he circumcised them. He said to them. “Do you think you will inherit this land while you are yet uncircumcised? Was it not said to Avrohom, ‘And you will preserve My covenant etc.’ ‘and I will give you and your descendants after you, the land of your sojournings.’”<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">Bereishis 17:8,9. Thus the inheritance of the land was dependent on their preserving the covenant, which was the rite of circumcision.</i>
<b>All the people that went out.</b> Not one of them was here for they had all died, and they had all been circumcised, as it is said, ‘for they were circumcised.’<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote">Next verse.</i>

### passuk 5
<b>Were not circumcised.</b> As I have previously explained, the north wind had not blown.<sup>6</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi to verse 2.</i> It was these who were now to be circumcised.

### passuk 6

### passuk 7
<b>And their children whom He brought up in place of them.</b> And their children whom He brought up in place of them, they were born in the wilderness it was them whom Yehoshua circumcised.

### passuk 8
<b>They remained in their places.</b> They remained in their places and they did not besiege the city.
<b>Until they were healed</b> from their wounds.

### passuk 9
<b>I have removed.</b> (Lit. I have rolled) I have removed the ridicule of the Egyptians who had said [when they were leaving], “See that ‘<i>Raah</i>’ is before you.<sup>7</sup><i class="footnote">Shemos, 10:10.</i> There is a star named <i>Raah,</i> which is a symbol of blood. We see it overpowering you in the wilderness.”<sup>8</sup><i class="footnote">The Egyptians intimated that Bnei Yisroel would meet with disaster if they left Egypt because they would be under the power of the star of blood.</i> This is what Moshe referred to in the wilderness [when he said,] “Why should the Egptians speak, saying, ‘With <i>Raah,</i> He took them out.’” But they did not know that [the blood they saw] was the blood of circumcision. And now when they were circumcised in the days of Yehoshua, and the blood of circumcision appeared, that ridicule was removed; for the mixed multitude that went up with them [from Egypt] were still taunting them. This is the way R’ Moshe, Ha Darshan explained [this passage.]
<b>I have removed.</b> [Lit. I have rolled] This is similar to: ‘Remove from me humiliation and contempt;’<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim 119:22.</i> ‘and he rolled off the stone.’<sup>10</sup><i class="footnote">Bereishis 29:10.</i>

### passuk 10

### passuk 11
<b>From the day after the Pesach.</b> This was the day of waving the <i>Omer,</i> for they sacrificed the <i>Omer</i> first.<sup>11</sup><i class="footnote">They could not have eaten from the new grain of Eretz Yisroel until after they brought the Omer sacrifice. See Vayikroh 23:14.</i> From the seventh day of Adar, the day when Moshe died, when the <i>manna</i> stopped falling, they were sufficiently supplied with the <i>manna</i> which was in their vessels which they gathered on the seventh of Adar, as it is said, ‘They ate the <i>manna</i> for forty years.’<sup>12</sup><i class="footnote">Shemos 16:35.</i> But these forty years lacked thirty days— for the <i>manna</i> began to fall on the fifteenth day of Iyar.<sup>13</sup><i class="footnote">Shemos 161, 13. See Rashi’s comments there.</i> We must say therefore that in the [matzo] cakes the Bnei Yisroel took with them from Egypt, they tasted the taste of <i>manna.</i>

### passuk 12
<b>No longer did the Bnei Yisroel have <i>manna</i>.</b> Therefore they ate of the grain of the land. If they would have had <i>manna</i> they would not have eaten of the grain, for the <i>manna</i> was agreeable to them. There is a parable for this: One says to a child, “Why are you eating barley bread?” “Because I have no wheat bread.” That is why it is said, ‘no longer did etc.’

### passuk 13
<b>When Yehoshua was in Yericho.</b> From here we can learn that the outskirts of a city are considered part of the city itself, for it impossible to say that Yoshua was actually inside Yericho.<sup>14</sup><i class="footnote">Since the Bnei Yisroel had not yet captured Yericho, he could not have been in the city itself.</i>
<b>Are you with us?</b> Have you come to support us?

### passuk 14
<b>I have now come.</b>—“to help you, for it is impossible for man to battle against it [Yericho] and capture it, to knock down the wall. However in the days of your master, Moshe, I came, but he did not want my presence, as it is said, ‘If your Presence [Adonoy] does not go, etc.’”<sup>15</sup><i class="footnote">Shemos 33:15.</i>

### passuk 15
<b>The officer of Adonoy’s host.</b> This refers to Bnei Yisroel, who are Adonoy’s host. The officer mentioned here is the Angel, Michoeil, as it is said, ‘Michoeil, your officer.’<sup>16</sup><i class="footnote">Daniel 10:21.</i>
