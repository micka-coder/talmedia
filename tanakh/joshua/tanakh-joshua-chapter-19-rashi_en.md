<b>The second lot came out.</b> It was second to that of Binyomin, for Binyomin’s lot was the first of the seven tribes whose representatives Yehoshua spoke to [saying]: “And they will divide it into seven parts,” for Yehudah and Yossef had previously received [their inheritance] as it is said there: “Yehudah will remain at his boundary in the south,” [and the house of Yossef will remain at their boundary in the north].”<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">See above 18:5.</i> From here he goes on to list the seven lots.

<b>Was too large for them.</b> It was more than was their due.<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">Various reasons are presented why Shimon was given part of their inheritance in the midst of Yehudah’s territory. Some say that Shimon helped Yehudah conquer their land and therefore merited to receive some of it as their own. Others maintain that this was because Yaakov had said: “Shimon and Levi are brothers, instruments of violence are their wares. I will disperse them throughout Yaakov and scatter them throughout Israel.” (Bereishis 49:5,7) Shimon was given a portion within Yehudah and Levi was scattered throughout many cities in the land.</i>

<b>Kislos-tovor.</b> I say that [כִּסְלוֹת] is an expression of flanks, כְּסָלִים, flancs in old French. This is similar to what is stated in Vayikro 3:4. It is not at its highest point and not at its bottom, but on its slope, near the middle, closer to the rear, than the front, like the flanks of an animal. [Thus in this verse it reads the flanks of Mt. Tabor]. However when Scripture states, Oznos-Tavor, it refers to a place near its top, the place where the ears are situated.

<b>East of Gitoh-cheifer.</b> To the east of Gat-hacheifer which is the name of the city of [the prophet] Yonah ben Amtai.
<b>Ittoh-kotzin.</b> This was the name of the city.
<b>It circled around to Neioh.</b> [From Rimmon] it circled to Neioh. In other words, from there, the boundary circled around to Neioh. Targum Yonason also explains it this way: “It extended to Rimmon, and from there it circled to Neioh.”<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi goes to great pain to refute those who say that the word הַמְתאָר is connected to רִמוֹן and thus translate, Rimon-misoar as though this was the name of the city.</i>

<b>The boundary of Bnei Don extended from them.</b> At this point they took only a small portion, but the lot also fell for them in another place which was a distance from their boundary, and thus the other tribes intervened between them.<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">Others explain the words, וַיֵצֵא גְבוּל בְנֵי־דָן מֵהֶם to mean, “the boundary of the Bnei Don was too small for them,” and they went out to capture the city of Leshem to make room for their population.</i>
<b>They fought against Leshem.</b> This took place later in the time of Osniel, the son of Kenaz, in the days of the graven image of Michoh, as it is said in the Book of Shoftim.<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote">Shoftim 17:3,4. 18:2. (See Rashi to 17:1.)</i>
<b>Leshem</b> This is the city of Layish, that is mentioned in the Book of Shoftim.<sup>6</sup><i class="footnote">Shoftim 18:7,14.</i>
