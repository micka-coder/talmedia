<b>Then [Yehoshua] spoke.</b> He said a song [of praise to God]<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rashi, Yehoshua sang a song of praise, and the word יְדַבֵּר which is usually translated as spoke, in this context is an expression of שִׁירָה.</i> in place of the sun, for he had said “Let the sun stop.” [meaning] that he silenced it from reciting its song.<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rambam and other commentaries, the sun, the moon and other heavenly spheres are living beings and possess intelligence. They hear and speak, and thus they interpret these verses literally: “The heavens recount the glory of the Almighty.” (Tehillim 19:2), and Praise Him, sun and moon, praise Him, all the stars of light. (Tehillim 148:3). They actually verbalize the praises of God in the same manner as do human beings and angels.</i> During the time it was silent it stood still without moving [on its Orbit,] for during every moment of its orbital movement it recites a song of praise.<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">Every moment of its orbit is a source of praise to God who created it in such a miraculous manner.</i> The plain meaning of the verse is that the word דוֹם is an expression of waiting as stated, “If they say to us wait,”<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">I Shmuel 14:9.</i> and similarly, “Wait for Adonoy,”<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim 37:7.</i>
<b>And the moon in the valley of Ayalon.</b> At that moment the moon stood opposite the valley of Ayalon which is a distance from Givon, for Givon is within the border of Binyomin<sup>6</sup><i class="footnote">Binyomin’s portion was in the south.</i> and Ayalon is within the border of Don.<sup>7</sup><i class="footnote">Don’s portion was in the north.</i>

<b>Is it not written [in the Seifer Ha Yoshor.]</b> This subject is recorded in the Torah,<sup>8</sup><i class="footnote">What is the Seifer Ha Yoshor that is mentioned in this verse? We do not have any book that is called by that name. Rashi identifies the Seifer Ha Yoshor with Seifer Bereishis. It is so called because Yoshor means upright, and this refers to our righteous forefathers, Avrohom, Yitchok and Yaakov.</i> for Yaakov had said to Yosef, regarding the descendents of Ephraim “The fame of his descendants will fill the nations.”<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote">Bereishis 48:19.</i> When did this occur? On the day the sun stood still for Yehoshua, the entire world was filled with the fame of Yehoshua.<sup>10</sup><i class="footnote">Yehoshua was a descendant of the tribe of Ephraim.</i> The sun stood still half-way in the sky<sup>11</sup><i class="footnote">It stood still half-way through its orbit in the sky.</i> and did not hasten to set for a complete day.

<b>Roll.</b> Roll large stones to the mouth of the cave.<sup>12</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi explains that the word  גָלוּ has the same meaning as גַלגְלוּ which means roll.</i>

<b>Not one person sharpened.</b> This is an abbreviated verse.<sup>13</sup><i class="footnote">Since the verse does not identify the subject, it is considered an abreviated verse.</i> No sharp [tongued] person, sharpened his tongue against a single person of Bnei Yisroel. 
חָרֶץ indicates the speech of the tongue. Similarly, “A dog will not sharpen its tongue.”<sup>14</sup><i class="footnote">Shemos 11:7 [see Rashi there].</i> Similarly “Then you will utter a sharp word.”<sup>15</sup><i class="footnote">II Shmuel 5:24.</i> You will call, you will cry out a battle shout.

<b>From Kadush-barnea to Gaza.</b> This refers to the south side of Eretz Yisroel going from east to west, but he did not conquer the entire boundary, leaving unconquered the area from Gaza to the [Mediterranean] Sea. This is what is stated below, “This is the land that remained [unconquered], the Gazites and the Ashdodites”<sup>16</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 13:2,3</i>
