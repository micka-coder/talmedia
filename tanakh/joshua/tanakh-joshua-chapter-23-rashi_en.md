<b>And a goad in your sides.</b><sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi takes the word לְשׁטֵט as an expression of prowing rather than as an expression of a rod or goad as do other commentaries.</i> They will prowl around you to loot and ransack.
<b>And thorns.</b> This is an expression of camps. Similarly: “And they will come upon you with camps,”<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">Yechezkeil 23:24.</i> like a shield (צִנָה) that surrounds a person on three sides, as it is said, “As a shield, you encompass him with favor,”<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim 5:13.</i> תַּעְטְרֶנוּ meaning תְּסוֹבְבֶנוּ, surrounding, similar to “And Shaul and his men surrounded David and his men.”<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">I Shmuel 23:26.</i> עוֹטְרִים meaning סוֹבְבִים, surrounding.
