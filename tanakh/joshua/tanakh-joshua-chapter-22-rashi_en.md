<b>[Divide the spoils] with your brothers—</b> Referring to Bnei Gad and Bnei Reouven. There are some who interpret “brothers” in referrence to those who remained behind to guard the cities and the women and children. [Even though] they did not cross the Jordan— with the armed division, nevertheless they received a share of the spoils.<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">This practice was instituted by Avrohom.
