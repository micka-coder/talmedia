THE WORDs OF the Koheleth, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.

### passuk 2
Vanity of vanities, saith Koheleth; Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.

### passuk 3
What profit hath man of all his labour Wherein he laboureth under the sun?

### passuk 4
One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh; And the earth abideth for ever.

### passuk 5
The sun also ariseth, And the sun goeth down, And hasteth to his place where he ariseth.

### passuk 6
The wind goeth toward the south, And turneth about unto the north; It turneth about continually in its circuit, And the wind returneth again to its circuits.

### passuk 7
All the rivers run into the sea, Yet the sea is not full; Unto the place whither the rivers go, Thither they go again.

### passuk 8
All things toil to weariness; Man cannot utter it, The eye is not satisfied with seeing, Nor the ear filled with hearing.

### passuk 9
That which hath been is that which shall be, And that which hath been done is that which shall be done; And there is nothing new under the sun.

### passuk 10
Is there a thing whereof it is said: ‘See, this is new’?—it hath been already, in the ages which were before us.

### passuk 11
There is no remembrance of them of former times; neither shall there be any remembrance of them of latter times that are to come, among those that shall come after.

### passuk 12
I Koheleth have been king over Israel in Jerusalem.

### passuk 13
And I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven; it is a sore task that God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith.

### passuk 14
I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and a striving after wind.

### passuk 15
That which is crooked cannot be made straight; And that which is wanting cannot be numbered.

### passuk 16
I spoke with my own heart, saying: ‘Lo, I have gotten great wisdom, more also than all that were before me over Jerusalem’; yea, my heart hath had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.

### passuk 17
And I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly—I perceived that this also was a striving after wind.

### passuk 18
For in much wisdom is much vexation; And he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.
