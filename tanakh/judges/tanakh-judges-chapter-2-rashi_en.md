<b> Hachem's emissary went up.</b> We learn in Seder Olam that this was Pinchos.<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote"> Son of Elazar, grandson of Aharon Hakohen. (Bemidbar, 25:11.)</i><sup>2</sup><i class="footnote"> Why is Pinchas entitled <span>מַלְאַךְ ה׳</span>, lit. “an angel of Hachem”? Because, when visited by the sacred spirit, he was enflamed with radiance. (Vayikra Rabah, A. See Rashi to Yehoshua, 2:4).</i>
<b>To Bochim.</b> The name of a place.<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">Not literally “weeping”. See vs.4,5.</i>
<b>I took you up.</b> This was My original intent,<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">The future tense, <span>אַעֲלֶה</span>, literally “I shall take”, indicates the intent which preceded the actual taking. See Rashi to Shemos, 15:1.</i> to take you up from Mitzrayim—and I did so—with the stipulation that My enemies be ousted.<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote"> As indicated by the warning against covenants [v.2].</i>

<b> Now I have also declared.</b> At present I have declared, in My fury.<sup>6</sup><i class="footnote">This is not part of the original intent stated in vs.1,2, but is a new declaration, made now because they sinned.</i>
<b>At your flanks.</b> They will harass your flanks with bandits and troops, pillaging and plundering.

<b> Yehoshua dismissed, etc.</b> This incident had taken place previously, but, as Scripture intends to relate that they acted wickedly [v.11], it begins with the following statement: at Yehoshua's death, when they resolved, in his presence, to serve Hachem, he dismissed them, each man to his ancestral property. They served Hachem throughout his days and the days of the elders. Afterward, "The Bnei Yisroel acted wickedly."

### passuk 7
<b> Whose days extended.</b> Their 'days' extended<sup>7</sup><i class="footnote">In contentment. However, their lives were short. (Shabbos, 105:b.-See Rashi there).</i> but not their 'years', as they neglected to eulogize him.<sup>8</sup><i class="footnote">Scripture omits any mention of a mourning period for Yehoshua, as with Aharon (Bemidbar 20:29) and Moshe (Devarim 34:8). This indicates that they were remiss in eulogizing him and mourning for him. (Tosafos to Shabbos, 105:b).</i> Thus it is said, "…of Mount Ga'ash"—<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote">“They buried him (Yehoshua)…at Mount Ephraim, north of Ga’ash.” [v.9] Mount Ephraim was better known than G’ash. Why, then, does Scripture identify the famous Mountain by its proximity to the obscure Ga’ash? Evidently, “Ga’ash” is not an identifying landmark, but is intended as a homiletical allusion to “ra’ash”, “storm”, teaching that the mountain stormed against them. (Maharsha to Shabbos, ibid.).</i> the mountain stormed at them<sup>10</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbos, ibid.</i> to slaughter them.

<b> At Timnas Cheres.</b> So entitled because a likeness of the sun<sup>11</sup><i class="footnote">‘Timnas Serach’ is literally translated as ‘The likeness of the sun’.</i> was placed over his grave, as if to say, "Alas, that a man who halted the sun<sup>12</sup><i class="footnote">Yehoshua ordered the sun to stand still, and the sun obeyed. (Yehoshua, 10:12,13.)</i> lies in the grave."

<b> Wherever they went, the hand of Hachem was destructive to them.</b> This refers to Elimelech, Machlon, and Chilyon—<sup>13</sup><i class="footnote">Naomi’s husband and two sons, mentioned in the opening passages of the Book of Rus. They were punished with poverty and then death. See Rashi to Megilas Rus, ch.1.</i> Seder Olam.

<b> When He would establish</b>—This describes an ongoing process—'When He would establish judges for them, and Hachem would visit with the judge, etc.'
<b>For He would recant.</b> He would recant, concerning them, from the destruction.<sup>14</sup><i class="footnote">Which He had intended to rain upon them. Accordingly, <span>יְנַחֵם</span> is not understood as ‘would find comfort,’ but as ‘would recant.’ See Rashi to Bereishis, 6:6, second interpretation.</i> This is Yonasan's rendition.
