<b> The [lit. crowned] Binyomin.</b> They encircled Binyomin the way a crown encircles the head.

<b>Called for their pursuit.</b> They called for pursuit behind them—they shouted to each other to pursue.
<b>And intercepted them at rest.</b> At the cities, where they generally rested, they intercepted them.
<b>Intercepted them.</b> Caught them. There is a similar term in the Talmud, "He pursued him a parsa in the sand, but did not catch him."<sup>16</sup><i class="footnote">Kesubos, 60:b.</i>

<b> Turned to the sons of Binyomin</b> in all the cities.
<b>Completely annihilating the cities.</b> They annihilated all the inhabitants of the cities,
<b>Including the cattle—</b>the people are included in "completely annihilating," since <span><b>מְּתֹם</b></span> denotes absolute annihilation. There is a problem with the location of one thousand, as twenty-six thousand were counted in the cities, and seven hundred at Givoh;<sup>19</sup><i class="footnote">V.15.</i> here, those who fell totaled twenty-five thousand, one hundred troops,<sup>20</sup><i class="footnote">V. 46.</i> and six hundred escaped to Rimon cliff.<sup>21</sup><i class="footnote">V. 47. This totals 25,700, whereas the total in v. 15 was 26,700.</i> Evidently, one thousand fled to the cities, and fell the following day when the Bnei Yisroel turned to the cities of Binyomin to annihilate the women and children.
