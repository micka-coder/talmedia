<b> There was a man from Mount Ephraim.</b> Although both incidents are recorded at the conclusion of this book, the episodes of Michah and the concubine at Givoh took place at the beginning of the period of Judges, during the days of Asniel ben Kenaz,<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">Asniel was the first of the judges.</i> as it is said, "They appointed, for themselves, the figure of Michah, etc., during the entire period of the <i>Mishkon</i> at Shiloh."<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote"></i> We learn that, throughout the period of Shiloh, the graven figure of Michah was in existence.<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">Thus encompassing the period of Asniel, as his tenure began after the death of Yehoshua, when the Mishkon had already been established at Shiloh.</i> Concerning the concubine at Givoh, it is said, about Yevus of Jerusalem, "Let us not turn to an alien city"<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote"></i> we learn that Jerusalem had not yet been conquered.<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote">It was later conquered by the tribe of Judah (1:8), during the time of Asniel (there, v.13).</i><sup>6</sup><i class="footnote">Seder Olam, 12.</i>

<b> Stolen from you [lit. "to you"].</b> Stolen from you.<sup>7</sup><i class="footnote"><span><b>לך</b></span>, lit. “to you”, may also be interpreted as “from you”.</i> Similarly,<sup>8</sup><i class="footnote">Shmuel 1, 21:6</i> "For women were withheld 'to' us,"—'from' us.
<b>When you cursed.</b> You cursed whoever stole it, and even uttered the curse in my ear.
<b>Look, the silver.</b> I confess to you, concerning it, that it is in my possession, as I stole it.

### passuk 3
<b> He returned the eleven hundred silver pieces to his mother.</b> He verbalized his intent to return it to her, hence, wherever it was, it reverted to her possession.
<b>I expressly consecrated the silver, from my hand to my son's.</b> I resolved to deliver it from my hand to yours for the purpose of making an image and a molten figure. Give it to me now, so that I may return it from my hand to you. Some say that this woman was Delilah, since Scripture specifies eleven hundred pieces of silver<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote">See above 16:5.</i>. However, they are in error, as Michah preceded Shimshon by many years.<sup>10</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi, v.l.</i> But the episodes are juxtaposed because of the corrupt silver, which was of equal value in each of the incidents. The silver inflicted injury in both cases.

### passuk 7
<b> Of the klan of Yehudah.</b> He was a Levi maternally.<sup>14</sup><i class="footnote">Paternally, he was descended from Yehudah. This explains why he was both “of the klan of Yehudah”, and a Levi.</i> However, the Rabbis<sup>15</sup><i class="footnote">Bava Basra, 109:b.</i> interpret that, because he behaved like Menasheh,<sup>16</sup><i class="footnote">The king who instituted idol worship throughout Eretz Yisroel. (Melachim 2, 21).</i> who was descended from Yehudah, he is described as "of the klan of Yehudah."
