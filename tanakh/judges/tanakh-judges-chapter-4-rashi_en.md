<b> Charoshes Hogoyim.</b> The name of a city, so entitled because it was a stronghold, and the seat of authority.<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">This is based on Targum Yonasan, who translates <span>חֲרֹשֶׁת הַגּוֹיׅם</span> as “the stronghold, metropolis of nations”.</i>

### passuk 3
<b> Oppressed the Bnei Yisroel intensely.</b> R' Tanchuma expounded, through ridicule. Similarly, it is said, "Your remarks offend me intensely."<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">Malachi, 3:13. Vs. 14, 15 there define the offensive remarks as ridicule of the worship of Adonoy.</i>

### passuk 4
<b> The wife of Lapidos.</b> She fashioned wicks for the sanctuary.<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">Megilah, 14:a. <span>לַפּׅיד</span> is translated as “torch”.</i>

### passuk 5
<b> Under [Devorah's] date tree.</b> She owned date trees in Yericho.
<b>Between Ramah and Beis El, on Mount Ephrayim.</b> From Yonasan's translation<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">Targum Yonasan renders, “She lived in the city of Ataros. Devorah was financially independent. She owned date trees in Yericho, orchards in Ramah, oil producing olive trees in the wetlands of the Beis Eil plateau, white soil in Tur Malka.”</i> we infer that this passage is not meant literally—that these are not intended to identify her dwelling place. Rather, we learn that she was an affluent woman, with financial interests in these places. She lived in a city named Ataros.
<b>Under [Devorah's] date tree.</b> She owned date trees in Yericho, vineyards in Rama, olive trees in the Bethel plateau, a fertile area, and white soil in Mount Ephrayim, at Tur Malka. In my opinion, this was sold for ceramic use. Some interpret "white soil" as grain fields, as in "the grain [lit. "white"] field."<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote">The Talmud [Moed Katan, 6:b, etc.] refers to the grain field as <span>שֽׂדֵה לׇכׇן</span>, literally “white field.” Rashi [Pe’ah, 3:1] explains that this is because grain whitens when ripe for harvesting. Or, to distinguish between the grain field, which is subject to the sun’s white glare, and the orchard, which is darkened by the shade of the trees.</i>

<b> At his heels.</b> With him.

### passuk 11
<b> Elon Betza'anayim.</b> The marshland plain.<sup>8</sup><i class="footnote">This is Targum Yonasan’s rendition.</i> A plateau area with marshes, "mariscum", "morass" in old French. This is called <span>אַגָנַיָא</span>—pools, similar to ditches where water settles, "entitled 'the earth's flasks.'"<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote">Kiddushin, 61:a, notes that water filed ditches are entitled <span>אַגׇּנֵי דּֽאַרְעָא</span>, “the earth’s flasks.” Thus, <span>אַגָנַיׇא</span>, “flasks,” refer to the marshland pools.</i>

<b> The milk pouch.</b> Since milk induces drowsiness, then slumber.<sup>10</sup><i class="footnote">He requested water. Why did she give him milk? To make him drowsy.</i>

### passuk 20
<b> Stand at the entrance to the tent.</b> Be zealous about it. Some interpret <span>עֲמֹד</span> [lit. "stand"] as <span>לַעֲמוֹד</span>, "to stand".<sup>11</sup><i class="footnote">This interpretation adds the <span>ל</span>, which does not actually appear in the text, so that the reading is “He told her to stand at the entrance.” According to the literal textual interpretation, the reading is, “He told her, stand at the entrance.” This is problematic, as the masculine <span>עֲמוֹד</span>, rather than <span>עִמֽדִי</span>, is inappropriate in addressing a woman. The additional <span>ל</span> solves this difficulty by transforming the command, <span>עֲמוֹד</span>, “stand”, into the infinitive <span>לַעֲמוֹד</span>, “to stand.”</i>

### passuk 21
<b> A tent peg.</b> "Chevilles" in old French. This is embedded in the ground with the lower flap of the tent in order to extend it fully.
