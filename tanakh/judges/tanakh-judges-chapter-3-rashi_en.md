<b> The Divine spirit visited him.</b> R' Tanchuma expounded: He studied the statement of the Holy One, blessed is He, to Moshe in Mitzrayim, "I have surely seen (lit. 'seeing, I have seen') the tribulation of my people."<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote"> Shemos, 3:7.</i> What are the two sights?<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">‘Seeing’ I have ‘seen’.</i> He said to him, "I see that they are destined to err with the golden calf—nevertheless, 'I have seen the tribulation of my people.'" Asniel expounded upon this, saying, whether innocent or guilty, He is obliged to save them.<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">Shemos Rabah, 3:2.

In his “judgement”, Yisroel was to be saved. (Radal there, 5)</i>
