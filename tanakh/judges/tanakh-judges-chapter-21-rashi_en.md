<b> To fight us</b> To go to war against us.
<b>We shall tell them we were merciful with them.</b> We were merciful with them because they did not know what to do, as we could not provide each of these men with a wife at the time of the war with Yoveish Gilod, except for four hundred of them. And if it is your oath that disturbs you, there is nothing sinful here on your part, since you were not the ones who provided them with your daughters, so that you would now be blameworthy. Peaceful salutations, have no fear!
