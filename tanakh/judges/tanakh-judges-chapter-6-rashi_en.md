<b> Acted wickedly.</b> Until this period, Scripture states, "They resumed [acting wickedly]" since their iniquities accumulated. However, through this hymn<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">Sung by Devorah and Barak [ch.5].</i> they were granted forgiveness for all that they had perpetrated.<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">Anyone rescued miraculously who then sings a hymn of praise forgiven all his sins, as if he had been newly created. (Yalkut, 60)</i> But now they began sinning anew. This interpretation is in Agadas Tehilim.

<b> If [lit. and] Hachem is with us.<sup>6</sup><i class="footnote">Not “And Hachem is with us,” as the literal reading would indicate, but “If Hachem is with us,” as demonstrated by the following phrase cited by Rashi, “why has [all this] occurred, etc.”.</i></b> If Hachem is with us, why has [all this] occurred, etc.
<b>Which our forefathers recounted to us.</b> It was Pesach, and he told him, "Last night father recited the Hallel for me, and I heard him read, "When Yisroel departed from Egypt"<sup>7</sup><i class="footnote"> “…the sea observed and fled, the Yardein turned back, etc.” (Tehilim, 114)</i>—but now He has abandoned us. If our forefathers were saintly, let Him act in our behalf in their merit; and if they were wicked, then, just as He worked His wonders for them gratuitously, so, let Him act in our behalf. Where are all His marvels?"<sup>8</sup><i class="footnote">Yalkut, 62.</i>

<b> Bullock [lit. bull ox].</b> The young bull, as even a day old ox is called an "ox".<sup>16</sup><i class="footnote">The inference of “Bull ox” is a bull that qualifies as an ox. Since even a day old bull qualifies, the reference is to a young bull.</i>

<b> You want to fight for [lit. "to"] the baal?</b> For the sake of the baal.
<b>To avenge [lit. rescue] him.</b> To exact vengeance for him.<sup>20</sup><i class="footnote">The literal translation of <span>תּוֹשִׁיעוּן</span>, “to rescue,” does not apply, since the idol was no longer endangered. The alternate interpretation, “to avenge,” is correct here.</i> Similarly, "by my own hand exacting my vengeance,"<sup>21</sup><i class="footnote">Shmuel 1, 25:33. <span>הוֹשִׁיעָה</span> is interpreted as “avenge.”</i> by David concerning Novol.
<b>Whoever fights for [lit. "to"] him.</b> For his sake.
<b>Wait until morning.</b> Until morning, wait.
<b>If he is a god</b> let him fight his own battle and exact his own vengeance. To rebuff them until Gidon could escape, he said this.

<b> Fight against him.</b> Against Gidon. In relation to <span>רַיב</span>, "fight", the proper term is <span>עִם</span>, or <span>אֶת</span>, or <span>בּוֹ</span>, "with" [him], as in "he fought with Lavan".<sup>22</sup><i class="footnote">Bereishis, 31:36.</i> However, <span>לוֹ</span>, lit.
