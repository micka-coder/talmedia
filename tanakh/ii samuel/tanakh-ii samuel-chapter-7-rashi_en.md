The “great people” referred to here are Avrohom, Yitzhok and Yakov. Just as they are mentioned in the first blessing of the Amidah, so too Dovid’s name is used in the ending of one of the Haftorah’s concluding blessings. (Rashi, ibid).</i>
<b>I will destroy all your enemies.</b> And that is why [the thought] came to your heart to build the House as it is written in the Torah.<sup>8</sup><i class="footnote">Devarim 12:10. See Rashi on verse 1.</i>

<b>With the rod of men.</b> This refers to Haddad and Rozon, the son of Elyodoh.<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote">Both were enemies of Shlomo, they are mentioned in Kings I, 11:14 and 23 respectively.</i>

<b>What more can Dovid say to You.</b> What more can I ask for?
<b>You know Your servant.</b> You have supplied me with all my needs as [it says] (Mishlei 12:10) "A righteous man knows his animal's being.<sup>15</sup><i class="footnote">The verse refers to a righteous person but Rashi is drawing an analogy to Hashem’s knowing the needs of his servants.</i>"

<b>For whom leaders went.</b> Moshe and Aharon as it is said, (Shemos 7:1). "I have made you a judge over Pharaoh" and so too did Yonasan translate, "messengers went from before Hashem."
<b>To redeem for Him a people.</b> This is what the messengers said to Yisroel, The Holy One, blessed is he sent us to redeem for Him a people, to put forth His Name and to make great [things happen] for you.
<b>Awesome things</b> You have done for your land after [Bnei Yisroel] left there [i.e., Egypt]. And what are the awesome things? From before Your people You expelled nations and their gods. This verse is missing [the word] "<span>לגרש</span>", [however] in Divrei Hayomim (I 17:21) it explains, "To expel from before Your people that You redeemed from Egypt, nations and their gods." [Our verse] isn't [really] missing [this word] because from the sense conveyed as it is said, "From before Your people, nations" we understand that it means pushed and driven out.
