### passuk 2
The spirit of the LORD spoke by me, And His word was upon my tongue.

### passuk 3
The God of Israel said, The Rock of Israel spoke to me: ‘Ruler over men shall be The righteous, even he that ruleth in the fear of God,

### passuk 4
And as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, A morning without clouds; When through clear shining after rain, The tender grass springeth out of the earth.’

### passuk 5
For is not my house established with God? For an everlasting covenant He hath made with me, Ordered in all things, and sure; For all my salvation, and all my desire, Will he not make it to grow?

### passuk 16
And the three mighty men broke through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David; but he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD.

### passuk 17
And he said: ‘Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this; shall I drink the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives?’ therefore he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men.

and he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man; and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and slew him with his own spear.

### passuk 22
These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had a name among the three mighty men.
