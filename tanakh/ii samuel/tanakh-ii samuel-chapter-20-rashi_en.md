<b>Close to his loins.</b> Very close to his body along the width of his loins, this was not the usual way of carrying a sword. He did so to make it easy for it to fall out so it would not be necessary to take it out of its sheath.
<b>He started out [towards Amosoh.].</b> Towards Amosoh.
<b>And it fell out.</b> The sword [fell out] from its sheath because it was smooth and sharp and was not hanging on the side of his thigh but it was along the width of his loins. As soon as he [Yoav] leaned forward towards the ground it [the sword] fell out of its sheath and he grabbed it with his right hand without Amosoh noticing anything.

Alternatively if it were against Dovid [who is a scholar] even if he was not the king, he [Shevah] is punishable by death.

<b>The woman came [and spoke] to all the people.</b> It is taught in a Tosefta:<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote">Terumos 7:23.</i> "She said to them, 'Since both he will be killed and they will be killed [they should] hand him over to them.<sup>10</sup><i class="footnote">To Yoav’s men.</i> If he were able to be saved, for example he was inside and you were on the outside and you were in mortal danger [fighting Yoav] [but] he could escape<sup>11</sup><i class="footnote">While you would be fighting.</i> [then we have a rule that] it is prohibited to let one person be killed in order to save another, [therefore, you cannot] have him killed to save yourselves. But now that he is [anyway] going to be killed with you because the walls have been breached and there is no possibility of escape,<sup>12</sup><i class="footnote">For anyone.</i> [then] it is better that he alone die and you should not die along with him.' Rebbe Shimon said, this is what she said to them, 'Anyone who has rebelled against the kingdom of the House of Dovid is punishable by death.'<sup>13</sup><i class="footnote">Threfore Shevah must be killed in order for you to be spared.</i>

And because of Yoav [remaining commander], he [Dovid] had to appoint his [Yoav's] friends.<sup>15</sup><i class="footnote">To the positions mentioned in the next few verses.</i>

<b>Eiroh the Yoiri.</b> Yonoson translated: "Eiroh who gives forth light from Tekuah." And so is he referred to in this book Eiroh ben Eikash of Tekuah. He was called Yoiri because it is taught in Menochos,<sup>16</sup><i class="footnote">Menochos 85b.</i> "Tekuah was first in [olive] oil," because olive oil was prevalent there from which candles are lit [in the Beis Mikdosh].
<b>Was a Kokein for Dovid.</b> He [Dovid] would give him [Eiroh] all his Kehunah gifts, that is what our Rabbis explained.<sup>17</sup><i class="footnote">Eiruvin 63a.</i> The simple explanation of the verse is that he [Dovid] made him [Eiroh] an officer and a judge.
