### passuk 1
<b>On account of Shaul.</b> On account of the sin regarding Shaul who was buried immediately and secretly as the men of Yovish Gilod stole his body and buried him. [Consequently] he was not eulogized with the respect due him.
<b>And his bloody House.</b> Because he killed out Nov, the city of Kohanim.
<b>And because he killed the Givonim.</b> When he killed out Nov, the city of Kohanim, he killed seven people from among them [the Givonim]. Two wood cutters, two water drawers, the sexton, the announcer and the scribe. This is what is explained in Yerushalmi Talmud, in Maseches Sanhedrin.<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">Yerushalmi Sanhedrin 29a.</i> [But] our Rabbis said,<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">Yevomos 78b.</i> On account that he [Shaul] killed the Kohanim [of Nov] that provided food for them [the Givonim], consequently Scripture considers it as if he killed them [as well]. Do not wonder that God demanded retribution for the lack of respect given to him<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the proper eulogy due him.</i> and simultaneously demanded retribution for his sin,<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">of killing out Nov.</i> because this what is what it is written, "Who has done His work,"<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote">Tsafanyoh 2:3.</i> when the person is being judged his good works [are remembered] this what we are taught in Maseches Yevomos.<sup>6</sup><i class="footnote">Yevomos ibid, See Rashi there.</i>

### passuk 2
<b>And spoke to them.</b> Words of appeasement [asking them] to put aside their feelings [of anger] and forgive Shaul and his household.
<b>The Givonim were not part of the Bnei Yisroel.</b> This is to say that they displayed how cruel they are, because they are not descendants of our forefather Avrohom. They have proven themselves unworthy to join with Yisroel and hence Dovid decreed that they not be permitted to marry into the Jewish community. He [Dovid] said, This nation [of Yisroel] has three characteristics, the people are merciful, they possess shame and perform kindful deeds for others. Whoever has these three characteristics is worthy of joining it [Yisroel].<sup>7</sup><i class="footnote">They have shown themselves to be cruel and unmerciful and hence they do not deserve to join together with Yisroel. Yevomos 79a.</i>
<b>Sworn to them [that they would let them live].</b> During the days of Yehoshua when he made woodcutters and water drawers for the Altar.<sup>8</sup><i class="footnote">Yehoshua 9:27.</i>
<b>In his zeal to avenge the Bnei Yisroel.</b> Because he [Shaul] intended to clean and purify Yisroel and to take care of their [Yisroel's] needs, he wanted to kill them. This anger was for a good purpose as we find "Are you zealous for my sake?"<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote">Bamidbar 11:29.</i> And we also find "by the zeal for God's sake" as was said of Yeihuh.<sup>10</sup><i class="footnote">See Melochim I, 19:10.</i> This is the simple explanation of our verse. [But] according to the Midrashic intepretation, he [Shaul] only ordered that the kohanim be killed. And the zeal described here was not for a good purpose but rather for a bad purpose because he [Shaul] knew that his kingdom would not continue further from the day that he did not heed God's commandment concerning Amalek,<sup>11</sup><i class="footnote">Shmuel I, 15:9.</i> and from that time on, he was angry [and persecuted] them.

### passuk 3
<b>So that you should bless the heritage of Hachem?</b> Pray for them.

### passuk 4
<b>We are not interested in silver or gold from Shaul.</b> We are only interested in [retribution against] people. He [Dovid] wanted to appease them with money but they did not want [to accept it]. He [Dovid] said, "It may be that they are embarrassed of each other." [Therefore] he went and tried to appease each one individually [but] they [still] would not be appeased. That is why it is written here, "I am not interested in silver or gold etc" in singular form.<sup>12</sup><i class="footnote">The verse is written with <span>לִי</span> in singular form, but is read with <span>לָנוּ</span>, plural form indicating that Dovid tried to appease them both collectively as a group and also on an individual basis.</i> This I saw in the Yerushalmi Talmud.<sup>13</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 29a.</i>
<b>And we are interested in killing anyone.</b> Among the rest of the Bnei Yisroel because they did not agrieve us.

### passuk 5
<b>And intended to destroy us.</b> He said in his heart that we should be destroyed [and prevented] by him "from establishing etc." He intended to destroy us.
<b>Intended.</b> He intended to destroy us.

### passuk 6
<b>We will hang them.</b> Hanging.
<b>Before God.</b> In the name of God, to publicize His edict.
<b>The chosen one of God.</b> A heavenly voice came forth and said, "The chosen one of God."<sup>14</sup><i class="footnote">The Givonim who hated Shaul would be unlikely to call him, “the chosen one of God.”</i>

### passuk 7
<b>The king had pity.</b> He prayed for pity on Mephivoshes that the Ark should not detain him; because Dovid had them [Shaul's children] pass before the Ark, whomever the Ark detained, was put to death.<sup>15</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., was handed over to the Givonim who subsequently put them to death. Yevomos 79a.</i>

### passuk 8
<b>Sons of Michal, the daughter of Shaul who had bore them to Adriel.</b> Did Michal give birth [to these children]? It was Meirav who bore [those children] to [Adriel]. [The explanation is] that Meirav gave birth [to them] and Michal<sup>16</sup><i class="footnote">Meirav’s sister.</i> raised them, that is why they are called by her name because someone who raises male and female orphans in their house it is considered as if that person gave birth [to the child] and [the child] is called by his name.<sup>17</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 19a.</i>

### passuk 9
<b>At the beginning of the harvest.</b> During the days of Nisson.

### passuk 10
<b>Until the rains fell on them.</b> During the rainy season in Tishri. Their bones were not removed for burial. But is it not written, "His body should not remain [hanging] overnight"<sup>18</sup><i class="footnote">Devorim 21:22. Why did Dovid let this happen?</i>? However they reasoned that it is better that one of the letters of the Torah be uprooted in order that God's Name be publicly sanctified. Passersby would ask "Why have these people come to this fate?" They were told [in response], "They are royal sons." "What did they do [wrong]?" "They assaulted downtrodden foreigners." [The passersby] would say, "There is no people better to associate with then this people."<sup>19</sup><i class="footnote">Yevomos 79a.</i>

### passuk 11

### passuk 12
<b>He took Shaul's bones.</b> He [Dovid] was told concerning them, "Because of Shaul"<sup>20</sup><i class="footnote">Earlier in 21:1.</i> who was not eulogized according to halachah.

### passuk 13
<b>They gathered the bones.</b> Of the seven people that were hung there.<sup>21</sup><i class="footnote">In verse 9.</i>

### passuk 14
<b>Everything that the king had commanded.</b> To eulogize them in all of the cities of Yisroel.

### passuk 15

### passuk 16
<b>A spear case weighing.</b> It is like a case that is at the top of spear's handle that is called aristuille in O.F., and it is made like a hat There is something comparable to it in Maseches Zevochim, "What were the pomegranates of the tunic<sup>22</sup><i class="footnote">Zevachim 88b. The tunic worn by the Kohen Godol.</i> similar to? They were like the caps on babies' heads" The caps [are called] hemles in O.F.
<b>Who was armed.</b> Armed with a new sword. I heard [an explanation] that on that day he was intitiated into the wearing of battle dress and it is the manner of those so initiated to [try to] be successful and mighty on the day of their initiation to make a name for themselves. That is why, <b>he said he was going to kill Dovid.</b>

### passuk 17
<b>[Came] to his aid.</b> He helped him with his prayer as is brought in [chapter] Cheilek.<sup>23</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 95a.</i>

### passuk 18
<b>There was more war.</b> This [war] came before all [those mentioned here] and is only recounted here to combine the deaths of the four sons of Orpoh.

### passuk 19
<b>Elchonon.</b> Dovid.<sup>24</sup><i class="footnote">We know that it was Dovid who killed Golias in Shmuel I, 17:51, consequently this Elchonon must be Dovid.</i>
<b>The son of Yari [whose family] were weavers.</b> His family weaved the partition curtain of the Beis Hamikdosh that is [also] called a forest.<sup>25</sup><i class="footnote">The Beis Hamikdosh is called a forest because it was made with planks of acacia wood, see Shmos 26:15.</i>
<b>Like that of the weaver's rod.</b> [Yonoson translates:] "Like the weaver's rod," that is called "ensouple" in O.F. Let a weaver come and stand up against a weaver['s instrument].

### passuk 20
<b>A giant man.</b> As [Yonoson] translated, "A man of [great] measure," the root [portion] of the word are the letters <span>מ</span> and <span>ד</span>.<sup>26</sup><i class="footnote">The <span>ין</span> being a suffix.</i> We find [similarly] from the word <span>שאון</span><sup>27</sup><i class="footnote">Tehilim 65:8.</i> [roar] the root letters are <span>ש</span> and <span>א</span> and from the word <span>הָמוֹן</span><sup>28</sup><i class="footnote">Bereishis 17:4.</i> the root letters are <span>ה</span> and <span>מ</span>.<sup>29</sup><i class="footnote">These two words also having <span>ין</span> as a suffix.</i> In Divrei Hayomim<sup>30</sup><i class="footnote">Divrei Hayomim I, 11:23.</i> it is written, "A man of measure"<sup>31</sup><i class="footnote">Concerning this same giant refered to in our verse but there the word <span>מִדָּה</span> is used without the suffix <span>ין</span>.</i> i.e., a very tall man who had people measuring his height.
<b>Numbered six each etc.</b> Our Rabbis explained in Maseches Bechoros<sup>32</sup><i class="footnote"></i> that the verse had to tell us "twenty-four"<sup>33</sup><i class="footnote">Despite the fact that given that his two hands and two feet had six digital extremities each, which obviously totals twenty-four.</i> in order that you should not say that the fingers of his two hands only came to a total of six and that the toes of his [two] feet only came to a total of six that is why it is written, "twenty-four." If it had written in our verse only 'twenty-four" and not had said "six each," I would have [mistakeingly] said, there were seven on one [hand or foot] and five on the other. And what is the verse trying to indicate by the word "number"? That all these digital extremities could be counted in the normal arrangement of fingers on a hand.
