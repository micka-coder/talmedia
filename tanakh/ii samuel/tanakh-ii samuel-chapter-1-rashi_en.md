<b>Behold a man came from the camp.</b> The Pesikta<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">Pesikta Rabosi 12,9.</i> brings an opinion that this man is Doeig,<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">Doeig HaEdomi is first mentioned in Shmuel 1,21:8.</i> but the explanation is indefensible in my heart.<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">It is clear from Shmuel 1, 22:18 that Shaul knew Doeig. Therefore, if in fact this man is Doeig, why did Shaul have to ask later in v. 8, “Who are you?” (Seder Hadoros, p. 102).</i>

And where [In Bereishis] is it hinted at? "Your hand will be on the neck of your enemies."<sup>15</sup><i class="footnote">Bereishis 49:8.</i> What type of warfare is it where he places his hand next to his forehead,<sup>16</sup><i class="footnote">When pulling back the string of his bow.

This is how they sight their targets.</i> which is opposite his neck?<sup>17</sup><i class="footnote">This interpretation reads the verse in Bereishis differently: “your hand will be on your neck.” See Marsho, Avodah Zarah ibid.</i> One must say: this is archery.

<b>Because there, the shield of soldiers spit out.</b> They had shields made of skins and when they went to war, they smeared them with oil so that a weapon hitting [the shield] should slip [off of it].

And here this is what the Lamentation means, "There, the shield of soldiers spit out," it spit out its oil and [the oil] did not stick to it and rendered [the shield] as if it wasn't smeared with oil.
