<b>And [an enfourage of] fifty men etc.</b> All of them had their thighs removed and the heals of their feet cut out.<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin 21a. Rashi there explains that not having thighs enabled them to run faster and not having heels enabled them to step on sharp objects without any sensation of pain.</i>

<b>At the end of forty years.</b> [After] Yisroel had asked Shmuel for a king this rebellion and weakening of the kingdom occurred.<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opinion of Rebe Nehuroi in the name of Rebbe Yohoshua brought in Temurah 14b. Rashi is explaining that these forty years are not describing how long Avsholom was engaged in his intriguing against the king. Rather, the verse is informing us that forty years after their improper request, the kingdom was weakened.</i>
<b>I would like to go.</b> To Chevron.
<b>And fulfill the vows [of bringing sacrifices]</b> Our Rabbis said, "[Avsholom wanted] to bring lambs from Chevron<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i> because there, the lambs were fat."<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi there brings the Talmud in Menachos 87a that discusses the quality of the lambs of Chevron.</i>

<b>Invited and leaving in innovence.</b> It is explained in the Yerushalmi tractate of Sotah<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 1, halach 8.</i> that he [Avsholom] requested of his father that he [Dovid] write [a document] for him that any two people that he request go with him, should go. He [proceeded] to show it [the document] to two people here and afterwords to two other people and in this way to many.<sup>6</sup><i class="footnote">But he implied to Dovid that only two men would go. He kept using the same document for more and more pairs of men.</i>

<b>With the king.</b> With Avsholom.
<b>Because you are a foreigner.</b> We are fleeing without provisions and food, and because you are a foreigner you will not find people that will have pity on you.
<b>And even if you are estranged [from Avsholom].</b> And even if you are exiled from the king [Avsholom] because you do not want to be with him, then return to your home because it is not good to go with me because you [just] came yesterday.<sup>7</sup><i class="footnote">This verse blends into verse 20 where Dovid explains more about why it is disadvantageous for Itai to stay with him.</i>

### passuk 20
<b>And should I today cause you to move with us.</b> I have no place that I can settle you there to escape because I am going to where circumstances have me go each day. When I hear that the pursuers are here I flee here. And so Yonasan translates [the verse], "And if you are estranged [from Avsholom] you can go home" [as:] "And if you you are estranged go [back] to your city."
<b>I will consider it kindness and truth.</b> I will credit you the favor of kindness and truth that you have done for me.

<b>They set down.</b> Like, "They stopped,"<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote">Previously in 6:17.</i> [Yonasan translates:] "They stopped the Ark." They stood it off to one side and the people passed by because Dovid wanted it brought with him.
<b>And Evyosor went off [to the side]</b> until [all the people] finished etc. This is a shortened verse they set down the Ark of God until all the people finished travelling.<sup>10</sup><i class="footnote">The words <span>ויעל אביתר</span> need to be placed at the end of the verse for interpretation.</i>
<b>Evyosor went off [to the side].</b> That day he was removed from the Kohanite service.<sup>11</sup><i class="footnote">As the Kohen Gadol.</i> because He inquired of the Urim and Tumim but was not answered,<sup>12</sup><i class="footnote">This showed that he was no longer qualified for this lofty position. The Urim and Tumim lit up certain letters on the kohen Gadol’s breastplate as a means for God to communicate to His people. See Shemos 28:30.</i> Tzodok then replaced him. This is what we learned in Seder Olam in tractate Yuma.<sup>13</sup><i class="footnote"></i>
