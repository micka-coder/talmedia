### passuk 1
My son, attend unto my wisdom; Incline thine ear to my understanding;

### passuk 2
That thou mayest preserve discretion, And that thy lips may keep knowledge.

### passuk 3
For the lips of a strange woman drop honey, And her mouth is smoother than oil;

### passuk 4
But her end is bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a two-edged sword.

### passuk 5
Her feet go down to death; Her steps take hold on the nether-world;

### passuk 6
Lest she should walk the even path of life, Her ways wander, but she knoweth it not.

### passuk 7
Now therefore, O ye children, hearken unto me, And depart not from the words of my mouth.

### passuk 8
Remove thy way far from her, And come not nigh the door of her house;

### passuk 9
Lest thou give thy vigour unto others, And thy years unto the cruel;

### passuk 10
Lest strangers be filled with thy strength, And thy labours be in the house of an alien;

### passuk 11
And thou moan, when thine end cometh, When thy flesh and thy body are consumed,

### passuk 12
And say: ‘How have I hated instruction, And my heart despised reproof;

### passuk 13
Neither have I hearkened to the voice of my teachers, Nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!

### passuk 14
I was well nigh in all evil In the midst of the congregation and assembly.’

### passuk 15
Drink waters out of thine own cistern, And running waters out of thine own well.

### passuk 16
Let thy springs be dispersed abroad, And courses of water in the streets.

### passuk 17
Let them be only thine own, And not strangers’with thee.

### passuk 18
Let thy fountain be blessed; And have joy of the wife of thy youth.

### passuk 19
A lovely hind and a graceful doe, Let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; With her love be thou ravished always.

### passuk 20
Why then wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, And embrace the bosom of an alien?

### passuk 21
For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, And He maketh even all his paths.

### passuk 22
His own iniquities shall ensnare the wicked, And he shall be holden with the cords of his sin.

### passuk 23
He shall die for lack of instruction; And in the greatness of his folly he shall reel.
