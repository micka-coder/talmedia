<b>Who among you is left</b> who was of the exiles and is still alive?
<b>who saw, etc.</b> Who saw the first one this [one] is of no esteem in his eyes.
<b>is it not as nothing</b> I know that to one who saw the first one, this one is but nothing in his eyes.
<b>is it... as nothing</b> It and nothing are equal, as in (Hos. 4:9) “And it shall be like people like priest” Here, too, כָמֹהוּ כְּאַיִן ; it [the Second Temple] and nothing are equal.

<b>the thing that I set up</b> You keep My Torah, and My spirit rests on your prophets; do not fear.

### passuk 6
<b>another one... [for] a little while</b> When this kingdom of Persia, which rules over you, terminates, yet another one will rise up to rule over you, to oppress you; this is the kingdom of Greece, and the time of its rule will be a little while.
<b>and I will shake up</b> with the miracles performed for the Hasmoneans.
<b>the heaven, etc.</b> And they will understand that My Shechinah rests in this House, and they will bring gifts of silver and gold, as is written in the book of Joseph ben Gurion.

### passuk 7

### passuk 8
<b>The silver is Mine, and the gold is Mine</b> and it is in My power to bring it to whomever I desire.

### passuk 9
<b>shall be greater</b> There was a controversy between Rav and Samuel. One said: In the building; and one said: In the years, that the years of the First Temple were four hundred and ten, and those of the Second Temple were four hundred and twenty.

### passuk 10

### passuk 11
<b>Now ask the priests the Torah</b> Perhaps in exile they forgot the laws of sanctified things, and of impurity and purity.

### passuk 12
<b>contaminated flesh</b> flesh of contamination of a carcass as a creeping thing.
<b>and the pottage</b> a cooked food
<b>“No.”</b> It [the food] will [not] become contaminated. Rav and Shmuel disagree over this matter. One [Rav] says that the priests erred, for he [Haggai] asked them concerning a fourth degree contamination in reference to hallowed things, and they replied that it [the food] is ritually pure. One [Shmuel] says that the priests did not err, that he [Haggai] asked them concerning a fifth degree contamination in reference to hallowed things.
<b>if it touches in his skirt</b> It did not touch the creeping thing itself but the garment, which is the first degree of contamination.
<b>will it become contaminated?</b> Heb. הֲיִקְדָּשׁ 

### passuk 13
<b>If the contamination of a dead body</b> The dead body itself.
<b>It will become contaminated</b> For the dead body is the father of the father of contamination. The fifth degree of the contamination of the reptile or rodent is a fourth degree in the contamination of a dead body.

### passuk 14
<b>So is this people</b> Just as you err in this, so do you err in many halachot.
<b>and whatever they will sacrifice there</b> if they do not put their hearts to learning.

### passuk 15
<b>and before</b> The years that passed.
<b>before placing a stone upon a stone</b> Before you return to resume the building and to add to the foundation that you laid in the days of Cyrus - when it [the building] was stopped - now put your hearts to engage in the building and in studying the necessities of the priesthood.

### passuk 16
<b>so that they should not come to a heap of twenty measures</b> So that you should not have a curse sent into your works as [there has been] until now; for they would set up a heap from which twenty seahs should be measured, and would find only ten.
<b>when one would come to the wine vat</b> That is the pit before the wine press, into which the wine flows.
<b>to draw off fifty press-measures</b> To draw out from [the winevat] fifty measures with which they would measure wine from the winepresses, and the name [of those fifty measures] is purah.
<b>to draw off</b> to draw, as in (Isa. 30:14) “To scoop water from a cistern”; and so (ibid. 47:2) “Draw off the path.”
<b>and there would be twenty</b> Not that more of a curse is sent into the wine than is sent into the grain, but a person [may] err in estimating the measure of the winevat because it is deep, while the heap [of grain] stands before him. In tractate Avoth d’Rabbi Nathan (4:4) we learned a reason why a small measure is not mentioned with regard to wine, while it is mentioned with regard to grain, e.g.. to draw off twenty-five press measures and it was ten. This teaches us that wine is an extra measure for the world, and when the wine suffers, it is a symptom of a curse for the world. Since the wine must be plentiful, [the prophet] counts a larger number concerning it.

### passuk 18
<b>that the Temple of the Lord was founded</b> That now for the second time they began to add to the first foundation that they had built in the days of Cyrus.

### passuk 19
<b>The seed is still in the granary</b> You have not yet sown this year, and the trees have not yet ripened their fruits. From now on you shall sow at a time of blessing, for the building of the Temple will bring blessing into the work of your hands.

### passuk 22
<b>and I will destroy the power of the kingdoms of the nations</b> The kingdom of Persia, which now rules over the entire world, will fall into the hands of another kingdom at the end of thirty-four years from the building of the Temple, as we learned in tractate <i>Avodah Zarah</i> (9a).

### passuk 23
<b>and I will make you as a signet</b> In contrast to what was decreed upon his father Jeconiah (Jer. 22: 24): “As I live, says the Lord, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, be a signet on My right hand, from there I will remove you.” [Jeremiah further] states there (ibid. 22:30): “Inscribe this man childless.” We learn that his repentance availed [Jeconiah], and Zerubbabel was born to him, and he was made as a signet.
