<b>If Mordechai’s avowal would be sustained.</b> Who said that he would never prostrate himself because he is a Jew, and was admonished against idolatry.<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">Esther Rabbah 7:8. When his servants told him that Mordechai refused to kneel, Haman remarked that Mordechai’s ancestors, Yaakov, Rachel and their children had prostrated themselves before Eisav, Haman’s ancestor. Upon hearing Haman’s remark, Mordechai replied that he was a descendant of Binyamin, who was born after Yaakov’s meeting with Eisav, and who had thus never prostrated himself before Eisav. Alternatively, היעמדו דברי מרדכי means “whether Mordechai’s words will avail,” i.e., if his actions were successful they would become a precedent for others to follow. </i>

Following Haman’s advice, Achashveirosh invited the Jews to the royal feast. Using his foresight, Mordechai them not to attend. However, many ignored his warning and joined in the drunken debauchery.

<b>The king removed his ring.</b> This represents the granting of any great matter that is required of the king;<sup>6</sup><i class="footnote">Otherwise why would the king present the ring to Haman who did not ask for it but rather requested to annihilate the Jews. The king’s removal of his ring was more effective than the forty-eight prophets sent by God to admonish the Jews. They were unable to convince them to repent, but the transfer of the ring to Haman resulted in repentance and three days of fasting.
