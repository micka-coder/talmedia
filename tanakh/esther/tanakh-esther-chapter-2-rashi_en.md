<b>He remembered Vashti.</b> Her beauty, and he became sad.<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">He was remorseful having realized that her refusal to appear before him was justified and the decree against her was wrong.

<b>And let his majesty appoint officials.</b> Since every commissioner is familiar with the beautiful women in his province.<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than appoint commissioners from Shushan, he should appoint local commissioners in his provinces because they would be more readily able to find the most beautiful women in their own provinces. </i>

<b>There was a Yehudite man.</b> Because he was exiled with the exile of Yehudah.<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi offers this explanation to reconcile the contradiction at the end of this verse where Mordechai is described as a Binyaminite man. Targum renders איש יהודי, “a pious Jew.” Alternatively, יהוד is similar to יחוד [=unification], i.e., Mordechai publicly unified God’s Name by refusing to bow before Haman, who wore an idolatrous image. (Esther Rabbah 6:2 and see Maseches Megillah 12b-13a) </i> All those who were exiled with the kings of Yehudah were called יְהוּדִים [Yehudites] among the nations, even if they were from another tribe.<sup>6</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Megillah 12b. </i> 
<b>A Binyaminite man.</b> He was from Binyamin, that is the plain meaning. But our Rabbis expounded what they expounded.<sup>7</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. </i>

<b>He eagerly delivered her cosmetics.</b> He was more expedient and quicker with bringing her [cosmetics] than with all the others.<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote">To avoid eating non-kosher food Esther had Hagai provide her with natural uncooked food. See Maseches Megillah 13a. </i> 
<b>Assigned to her.</b> To serve her, and so they would do for all of them; and our Rabbis expounded what they expounded.<sup>10</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. By having seven maidservants Esther was able to know when it was Shabbos. She called each one on a different day of the week and when the one that was assigned for Shabbos would come, she knew it was Shabbos. Another reason for having seven maidservants, one for each day of the week, so that the maidservants for weekdays would not observe her resting on Shabbos and detect that she was Jewish. According to Targum, each maidservant’s name corresponded to a specific day’s part of creation. </i>

<b>And what would be done with her.</b> He [Mordechai] was one of two righteous men to whom a hint of salvation was given; Dovid and Mordechai. Dovid as it is stated, “Even the lion and the bear has your servant slain.”<sup>12</sup><i class="footnote">I Shmuel 17:36. </i> He [Dovid] said [to himself], “this incident did not happen to me only that I should rely on it and do battle with this one [Golyas].” And similarly, Mordechai [said to himself], “It did not happen to this righteous woman that she should be taken to a gentile’s bed only that she is destined to rise to save Yisroel.” He therefore repeatedly went around to find out what would be her fate.<sup>13</sup><i class="footnote">Esther Rabbah 6:6. Accordingly ומה יעשה בה means “and what would be accomplished through her.” </i>
