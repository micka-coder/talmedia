<b>And Moshe assembled —</b> on the day following Yom Kippur when he came down from the mountain. It ( וַיַּקְהֵל ) is in the causative form, for one does not assemble people, literally, with one’s hands but, rather, they are “caused to be assembled” by means of his saying so. The correct version of this in Onkelos is: וְאַכְנִישׁ — “He caused that they assemble.”

<b>And the leaders [of the tribes] brought.</b> R. Noson said: Why did the נְשִׂיאִים see fit to contribute to the dedication of the altar first whereas for the works of the <i>mishkon</i> they were not the first to contribute? But the נְשִׂיאִים thought as follows: “Let the public-at-large contribute whatever they will contribute, and whatever will be lacking we will supply.” Once the public supplied all that was needed, as it is said: “And the work was sufficient,” the נְשִׂיאִים said, “what is left for us to do?” So “they brought the <i>shoham</i>-stones, etc.” It is for this reason that they contributed to the altar dedication first. And since, at first, they were somewhat lax, there is a letter missing, here, from their name and it is written וְהַנְּשִֹאִם (without a י' after the שֹ' ).

<b>And Oholiov.</b> He was from the Tribe of Dan, one of the lowliest of the Tribes, one of the sons of [Yaakov’s] maidservants. Yet God equates him to Betzalel regarding the works of the <i>mishkon,</i> and he (Betzalel) is from the greatest of the Tribes. This tends to fulfill what is stated: “He does not recognize the rich over the poor.”
