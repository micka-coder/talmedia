<b>And a meal-offering.</b> [I.e.,] the <i>mincha</i> of the libations of the <i>tamid.</i> As it is said: “[And with one lamb bring] a tenth [of an <i>eipha</i>] of flour mixed with oil, etc.”

<b>Moshe and Aharon ... washed ... from it. </b> On the eighth day of the Installations all of them (Moshe, Aharon and his sons) were equal in the priesthood. Onkelos’ translation [of וְרָחֲצוּ] is: And they sanctified themselves from it. On that very day Moshe was sanctified with them.

### passuk 35
<b>Moshe was unable to enter the Tent of Meeting.</b> Yet, another verse states: “And when Moshe would come into the Tent of Meeting” There comes a third verse [later in our verse] and reconciles them: “for the cloud was upon it (on the Tent of meetings)” Say, therefore: as long as the cloud was upon it he could not come in; once the cloud left he would enter and speak with Him.

### passuk 38
<b>Before the eyes of the entire Beis Yisrael in all their travels.</b> At every station that they stopped the cloud would rest at the place where they encamped. Their encampment is also called מַסָּע Similarly: “He went to his ( לְמַסָּעָיו ) resting places.” Similarly: “These were ( מַסְעֵי ) the stations.” Because from the place of encampment they again journeyed, therefore, they are called מַסָּעוֹת .
