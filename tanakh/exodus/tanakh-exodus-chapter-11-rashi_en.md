<b>Completely.</b> [Onkelos translates כָּלָה as:] גְמִירָא — <i>completely</i> [having the same meaning as] כָּלִיל [Here, meaning] “He will send you all away.” 

### passuk 2
<b>Speak, please</b> נָא can only indicate pleading. [i.e.,] “I ask of you, speak to them about this, so that that righteous person, Avraham, may not say, [The promise of] ‘They will enslave them and oppress them’ He fulfilled in them, [but the promise:] ‘And afterwards they will leave with great wealth,’ He did not fulfill in them.”

### passuk 4
<b>Moshe said, “This is what Hachem has said.”</b> While still standing before Pharaoh this prophecy was told to him because once he left his (Pharaoh’s) presence he did not see his face ever again. 
<b>About the time of midnight.</b> [כַּחֲצֹת לַיְלָה lit. means:] <i>when the night is divided. </i> כַּחֲצוֹת being the same form as בַּעֲלוֹת (<i> When [it] went up</i>) or ( בַּחֲרוֹת ) <i>when they became angry at us.</i> This is its ( כַּחֲצֹת לַיְלָה ) plain meaning so that it fits within its context, for חֲצוֹת is not the noun of חֵצִי . Our Sages [however] explained it ( כַּחֲצוֹת לַיְלָה ) as: <i>about the time of midnight.</i> And they [go on to] say that Moshe used the word כַּחֲצוֹת which implies at about [midnight], either [slightly] before or after, and he did not say בַּחֲצוֹת (<i>at</i> midnight) lest Pharaoh’s stargazers make a mistake and say, “Moshe is a liar!” But God who knows His [exact] times and moments, [actually] said, “<i>At</i> midnight.” 

### passuk 5
<b>To the first-born of the captive.</b> Why were the captives struck down? So that the captives should not say, their own god demanded [vengeance for] their humiliation and brought retribution upon the Egyptians. 
<b>From the first-born of Pharaoh to the first-born of the slave girl.</b> All those less [important] than the first-born of Pharaoh and more [important] than the first-born of the slave girl are included [in this description]. Why were the first-born of the slave girls struck? Because they too enslaved them (the Israelites) and rejoiced in their (the Israelites’) oppression.
<b>And every first-born animal.</b> Because they (the Egyptians) worshipped it. When God punishes an idol worshipping nation He punishes its gods [first].

### passuk 7
<b>A dog will not sharpen its tongue.</b> I say that [יֶחֱרַץ] is a term meaning <i>sharp</i>. Similarly “ לֹא חָרַץ his tongue towards any man of the B’nei Yisroel.” [לֹא חָרַץ meaning:] <i>He did not sharpen</i>. [or:] אָז תֶּחֶרֳץ — “Then you will utter a sharp sound. [or:] לְמוֹרַג חָרוּץ — “A sharp thresher.” [or:] “ מַחְשְׁבוֹת חָרוּץ ” — “The thoughts of a sharp one” [חָרוּץ meaning:] a sharp and clever person. [or:] “You bring wealth to the hand of the חָרוּצִים ” [חָרוּצִים meaning:] the clever ones — sharp merchants.
<b>That Hachem distinguishes.</b> [יַפְלֶה means] <i>He will make a distinction.</i>

### passuk 8
<b>Then all your servants will come down</b> [Moshe] showed respect to royalty [by using this phrase]. For ultimately Pharaoh himself came down to him at night and said: “Arise! get out from among my people!” though Moshe [out of respect] had not initially said, “You will come down and bow to me.” 
<b>That follow you.</b> [Meaning:] those who follow your advice and ways.
<b>Then I will go out —</b> together with all the people from your land.”
<b>He then left Pharaoh.</b> [But only after] concluding his words did he (Moshe) leave his presence.
<b>In great anger.</b> Because he (Pharaoh) had said to him, “Do not see my face again!” (v. 28). 

### passuk 9
<b>Thus I will multiply My wonders.</b> The word מוֹפְתַי [in the plural] represents two [wonders]. רְבוֹת — <i>increase</i> represents a third [wonder]: 1. the killing of the first-born, 2. the splitting of the Reed Sea, and 3. the turbulent stirring of the Egyptians. 

### passuk 10
<b>Moshe and Aharon had done, etc.</b> This has already been written for us regarding all the wonders, and is repeated here only as a lead-in to the section that follows it.
