And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:

### passuk 2
’Speak unto the children of Israel, that they take for Me an offering; of every man whose heart maketh him willing ye shall take My offering.

### passuk 3
And this is the offering which ye shall take of them: gold, and silver, and brass;

### passuk 4
and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats’hair;

### passuk 5
and rams’skins dyed red, and sealskins, and acacia-wood;

### passuk 6
oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense;

### passuk 7
onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate.

### passuk 8
And let them make Me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them.

### passuk 9
According to all that I show thee, the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the furniture thereof, even so shall ye make it.

### passuk 10
And they shall make an ark of acacia-wood: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.

### passuk 11
And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about.

### passuk 12
And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the four feet thereof; and two rings shall be on the one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it.

### passuk 13
And thou shalt make staves of acacia-wood, and overlay them with gold.

The staves shall be in the rings of the ark; they shall not be taken from it.

And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee.

### passuk 17
And thou shalt make an ark-cover of pure gold: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof.

### passuk 18
And thou shalt make two cherubim of gold; of beaten work shalt thou make them, at the two ends of the ark-cover.

### passuk 19
And make one cherub at the one end, and one cherub at the other end; of one piece with the ark-cover shall ye make the cherubim of the two ends thereof.

### passuk 20
And the cherubim shall spread out their wings on high, screening the ark-cover with their wings, with their faces one to another; toward the ark-cover shall the faces of the cherubim be.

### passuk 21
And thou shalt put the ark-cover above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.

### passuk 22
And there I will meet with thee, and I will speak with thee from above the ark-cover, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel.

### passuk 23
And thou shalt make a table of acacia-wood: two cubits shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.

### passuk 24
And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make thereto a crown of gold round about.

### passuk 25
And thou shalt make unto it a border of a handbreadth round about, and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border thereof round about.

### passuk 26
And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in the four corners that are on the four feet thereof.

### passuk 27
Close by the border shall the rings be, for places for the staves to bear the table.

### passuk 28
And thou shalt make the staves of acacia-wood, and overlay them with gold, that the table may be borne with them.

### passuk 29
And thou shalt make the dishes thereof, and the pans thereof, and the jars thereof, and the bowls thereof, wherewith to pour out; of pure gold shalt thou make them.

### passuk 30
And thou shalt set upon the table showbread before Me always.

### passuk 31
And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candlestick be made, even its base, and its shaft; its cups, its knops, and its flowers, shall be of one piece with it.

### passuk 32
And there shall be six branches going out of the sides thereof: three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the candle-stick out of the other side thereof;

### passuk 33
three cups made like almond-blossoms in one branch, a knop and a flower; and three cups made like almond-blossoms in the other branch, a knop and a flower; so for the six branches going out of the candlestick.

### passuk 34
And in the candlestick four cups made like almond-blossoms, the knops thereof, and the flowers thereof.

### passuk 35
And a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, for the six branches going out of the candlestick.
