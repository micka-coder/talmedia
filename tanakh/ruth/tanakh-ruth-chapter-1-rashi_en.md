<b>And it happened in the days when judges judged.</b> [During the period] before King Shaul reigned, when the generations were administered by judges;<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">There was no individual judge who could exercise control over all of Yisroel, rather there were many judges. (Malbim) Alternatively, this was a period when God judged the judges. (Gra) </i> and this occurred in the days of Ivtzan, as our sages said, “Ivtzan is Bo’az.”<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Bava Basra 91a; and Bo’az is a central figure in Megillas Rus. </i> 
<b>And a man went.</b> He was very wealthy,<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">איש denotes an important person, as Targum renders, גברא רבא, “a great man.” </i> and the leader of the generation. He left Eretz Yisroel for regions out of the land because of stinginess, for he was miserly toward the poor who came to press him;<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">He was the only man to leave Eretz Yisroel because of the famine. Because of his stature and greatness he was severely punished for leaving Eretz Yisroel and remaining in Mo’av. (Malbim) </i> therefore he was punished.<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote">He was afraid that the poor would unite and confiscate all of his possessions. (Malbim) </i> 

### passuk 2
<b>Ephrathites.</b> Important people, and similarly, “the son of Tochu, the son of Tzuph, an Ephrathite,”<sup>6</sup><i class="footnote">I Shmuel 1:1. </i> [meaning] an aristocrat. Look how important they were, for Eglon the King of Mo’av married off his daughter to Machlon, as the Master said, “Rus was the daughter of Eglon.”<sup>7</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Sanhedrin 105b. </i> Another explanation of “Ephratites,” [they were from Beis Lechem,] because Beis Lechem is called Ephros.<sup>8</sup><i class="footnote">See Bereishis 48:7, “and I buried her [Rachel] on the way to Ephros which is Beis Lechem.” </i> 

### passuk 3
<b>Naomi’s husband.</b> Why is this stated again? From here they derived, “A man does not die except for his wife [i.e., she feels the loss more than anyone].<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Sanhedrin 22b. </i> ([Another interpretation:] And it states, “Naomi’s husband,” i.e., that because he was Naomi’s husband and ruled over her<sup>10</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi in Bereishis 9:20. </i> and she was subordinate to him, therefore the Divine Attribute of Justice struck him and not her.)<sup>11</sup><i class="footnote">Because once he decided to leave, his wife and two sons were compelled to follow. </i>

<b>Both.</b> What is the meaning of “also” גַם? First they were struck by financial loss and their camels and their cattle died; afterwards they “also” died.<sup>12</sup><i class="footnote">When God punishes man He first deprives him of his property, and if he does not repent, God smites him in person. Alternatively, “also” indicates that their death was punishment “also” for having remained outside of Eretz Yisroel. </i>

<b>She left the place.</b> Why is this stated? It is already stated, “and she returned from the fields of Mo’av,”<sup>13</sup><i class="footnote">Above, verse 6. </i> and from where could she return if not from the place where she had been? Rather the phrase tells us that the departure of a righteous person from a place is noticeable and makes an impression; its splendor departs, its glory departs, the praise of the city departs. And similarly, “And Yaakov left Be’er Sheva.”<sup>14</sup><i class="footnote">Bereishis 28:10. </i>

<b>For I am too old to have a husband.</b> That I should marry him and bear sons, that you would marry them, for they would not be forbidden to you [to marry] and you would not be forbidden to them as far as [the prohibition against marrying] the wife of an older brother who died before he was born, for she [the widow] does require a levirate marriage because Machlon and Chilyon were not [halachically] married to them because they were gentiles and had not converted,<sup>15</sup><i class="footnote">Had they converted before, their marriage would be binding and Rus would be prohibited from marrying Machlon’s yet unborn brother. The law of levirate marriage does not apply to a person born after his brother’s death. Marrying one’s brother’s wife constitutes incest when levirate marriage does not apply. However, since there was no binding marriage, Rus would be permitted to marry Machlon’s yet unborn brother. </i> and now they were coming to convert as it is stated, “We will return with you to your people.”<sup>16</sup><i class="footnote">Above, verse 10. </i> From now on we will become one people. 
<b>Even if I could say, “I have yet hope.</b>” For even if my heart told me that I have hope to marry again and to bear sons. 
<b>Even if I were to have a husband tonight.</b> And more than this, even if I were to conceive male offspring tonight. 
<b>And even if I were to bear sons.</b> Or even if I had already borne sons.

### passuk 13
<b>Would you wait for them.</b> This is a question posed in wonder, “Would you perhaps wait for them until they grew up?”<sup>17</sup><i class="footnote">The feminine form of them [להן] is used, because Naomi was hinting that perhaps she would bear daughters instead of sons, so why wait for “them”? </i> This תְּשַׂבֵּרְנָה is an expression similar to, “whose hope שִׂבְרוֹ is in Hachem his God.”<sup>18</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim 146:5. Also, see Megillas Esther 9:1. </i> 
<b>Would you shut yourselves in.</b> An expression of עוֹג, being bound and imprisoned, as in, “He made a [confining] circle and stood within it.”<sup>19</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Ta’anis 19a. </i> Others interpret it as an expression of עִגּוּן, anchoring [i.e., being unable to marry], but that cannot be, for if so the <i>nun</i> should have been punctuated with a <i>dagesh</i> or it should have been spelled with two nuns.<sup>20</sup><i class="footnote">See Maseches Bava Basra 73a and Rashi’s commentary there. </i> 
<b>For against me is directed the hand of Hachem.</b> Rabbi Levi said, “Wherever it mentions “the hand of Hachem,” it refers to a plague of pestilence, and the classic example is, “Behold the hand of Hachem is directed [at your livestock ... a very heavy pestilence].”<sup>21</sup><i class="footnote">Shemos 9:3. </i>

<b>See, your sister-in-law has gone back.</b> In this [word], the accent is at the beginning [on the first syllable] under the <i>shin</i>, because it is in the past tense. [But,] “and in the morning she would return,”<sup>22</sup><i class="footnote">Megillas Esther 2:14. </i> the accent is at the end [on the last syllable], on the <i>bais</i>, because it is in the present tense, and so it is in all similar cases.<sup>23</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi in Bereishis 29:6. </i> 

### passuk 16
<b>Do not urge me.</b> Do not press me.
<b>For wherever you go, I shall go.</b> From here our Rabbis of blessed memory derived<sup>24</sup><i class="footnote">In Maseches Yevamos 47b. </i> that if a [prospective] proselyte comes to convert, we inform him of some of the punishments [for violating the commandments] so that is he decides to renege [from his intention to convert], he can renege; for out of the words of Rus, you can learn what Naomi said to her. [Naomi said.] “We may not venture outside the boundary [of 2000 cubits beyond city limits] on Shabbos.” She [Rus] replied to her, “For wherever you go I shall go.”<sup>25</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, just as you are going to Eretz Yisroel for the sake of your religion, so it is my purpose to go there in order to be able to keep the Torah’s commandments. (Malbim) </i> [Naomi then said,] “We are prohibited to allow a woman to be secluded with a man who is not her husband.” She [Rus] replied, “Where you lodge, I will lodge.” [Naomi said,] “Our nation is separated from other nations by 613 commandments,” [and Rus replied,] “Your people are my people.” [Naomi said,] “Idolatry is forbidden to us,”<sup>26</sup><i class="footnote">Although idolatry is forbidden to Noahites, they are forbidden to worship idols only if they do so exclusively, but not if they worship God in conjunction with their idolatry. (Torah Temimah) </i> [to which Rus replied,] “Your God is my God.” [Naomi then said,] “Four [types of] death penalties were delegated to Beis Din [to punish transgressors],” [and Rus replied,] “Where you die, I will die.” [Naomi continued,] “Two burial plots were delegated to Beis Din [to bury those executed], one for those stoned and those burned, and one for those decapitated and those strangled.” She [Rus] replied, “And there I shall be buried.” 

### passuk 17
<b>So may Hachem do to me.</b> As He has begun to afflict [me], for His hand has gone forth against me to kill my husband and to cause me to lose my possessions. 
<b>And even more.</b> If anything but death separates me from you.

### passuk 18
<b>She refrained from further discussion with her.</b> From here they derived, “we neither overburden him [a prospective convert], nor are we meticulous with him.”<sup>27</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Yevamos 47b; i.e., we neither persuade nor dissuade him too much. </i> 

### passuk 19
<b>So the two of them went on.</b> Rabbi Abahu said, “Come and see how dear the proselytes are before the Holy One, Blessed Is He. As soon as she decided to convert, Scripture compared her to Naomi [by stating, “the two of them...”].<sup>28</sup><i class="footnote">Despite leaving her home and family, Rus’ determination was so strong that Scripture ranks her equally with Naomi. </i> 
<b>The whole city was astir.</b> The whole city became astir. They had all gathered to bury the wife of Bo’az, who had died that very day.<sup>29</sup><i class="footnote">Apparently the people of the city were gathered together because “the whole city” learned so quickly of their return. Rashi therefore explains why they had gathered. </i> 
<b>Is this [really] Naomi.</b> The <i>hai</i> is vowelized with a <i>chataf</i> because it is in the interrogative. Is this Naomi who was accustomed to travel in covered wagons and with the mules?<sup>30</sup><i class="footnote">Because of the affliction and the hunger that she endured, Naomi’s appearance changed so drastically that they were hardly able to recognize her. </i> Have you seen what has befallen her because she went abroad [i.e., outside Eretz Yisroel]? 

### passuk 20

### passuk 21
<b>I had gone forth full.</b> With wealth and sons. Another interpretation [of “full”] is that she was pregnant.
<b>Has testified against me.</b> Has testified against me that I had sinned before Him. Another explanation is that the Divine Attribute of Justice has humbled me, as in, “And the pride of Yisroel shall be עָנָה humbled.”<sup>31</sup><i class="footnote">Hoshe’a 5:5. </i> 

### passuk 22
<b>At the start of the barley harvest.</b> The verse speaks about the harvest of the Omer.<sup>32</sup><i class="footnote">The barley for the omer was harvested on the second night of Pesach and offered on the following day. </i>
