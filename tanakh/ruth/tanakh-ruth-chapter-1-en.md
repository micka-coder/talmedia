AND IT came to pass in the days when the judges judged, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Beth-lehem in Judah went to sojourn in the field of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.

### passuk 2
And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Beth-lehem in Judah. And they came into the field of Moab, and continued there.

### passuk 3
And Elimelech Naomi’s husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.

### passuk 4
And they took them wives of the women of Moab: the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth; and they dwelt there about ten years.

### passuk 5
And Mahlon and Chilion died both of them; and the woman was left of her two children and of her husband.

### passuk 6
Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return from the field of Moab; for she had heard in the field of Moab how that the LORD had remembered His people in giving them bread.

### passuk 7
And she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah.

### passuk 8
And Naomi said unto her two daughters-in-law: ‘Go, return each of you to her mother’s house; the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.

### passuk 9
TheLORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband.’ Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.

### passuk 10
And they said unto her: ‘Nay, but we will return with thee unto thy people.’

### passuk 11
And Naomi said: ‘Turn back, my daughters; why will ye go with me? have I yet sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?

### passuk 12
Turn back, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say: I have hope, should I even have an husband to-night, and also bear sons;

### passuk 13
would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye shut yourselves off for them and have no husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes, for the hand of the LORD is gone forth against me.’

### passuk 14
And they lifted up their voice, and wept again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law; but Ruth cleaved unto her.

### passuk 15
And she said: ‘Behold, thy sister-in-law is gone back unto her people, and unto her god; return thou after thy sister-in-law.’

### passuk 16
And Ruth said: ‘Entreat me not to leave thee, and to return from following after thee; for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge; thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God;

### passuk 17
where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried; the LORD do so to me,and more also, if aught but death part thee and me.’

### passuk 18
And when she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, she left off speaking unto her.

### passuk 19
So they two went until they came to Beth-lehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Beth-lehem, that all the city was astir concerning them, and the women said: ‘Is this Naomi?’

### passuk 20
And she said unto them: ‘Call me not Naomi, call me Marah; for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.

### passuk 21
I went out full, and the LORD hath brought me back home empty; why call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?’

### passuk 22
So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned out of the field of Moab—and they came to Beth-lehem in the beginning of barley harvest.
