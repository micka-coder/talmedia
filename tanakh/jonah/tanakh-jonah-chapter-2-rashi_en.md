<b>a huge fish</b>—It was a male, and he stood there with room, so that he did not think to pray. The Holy One, blessed he He, hinted to the fish, and it spewed him out into the mouth of a female, which was full of embryos, and it was crowded there, and he prayed there, as it is said: (verse 2) “from the belly of the fish (הַדָּגָה).” [from <i>Pirk&amp;d’Rabbi Eliezer</i> ch. 10, according to <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> ; <i>Midrash Yonah</i>, second version, <i>Otzar Medrashim</i> p.219] <b>[And the Lord appointed</b>—Those sixteen days that Israel was missing the manna, since they did not eat it for a complete forty years - God took this manna and sustained the fish so that Jonah would not be digested in its intestines, and Jonah, too, ate within it from this manna. Therefore, it is stated וַיְמַן, the letters מָן י"ו sixteen [days of] manna. Similarly, וַיְמַן קיקָיוֹן, and He appointed a kikayon, for he ate four omers; therefore, it says four times וַיְמַן (4:6 ff.). And in Greek, manna is called “kika.” For that reason, it is stated: קִיק יָוָן ; i.e, manna in Greek. -[<i>Sod Mesharim</i>]

### passuk 6
<b>the Red Sea hangs over my head</b> Lit., reeds are bound to my head. [<i>Jonathan</i> renders:] The Red Sea hangs over my head.

<b>To the bottoms of the mountains I descended</b>—To the end of the measure of the mountains fixed to the deep, I descended. 
And I said... <b>the earth - its bars are closed on me</b> Heb. בַּעֲדִי, against me, over me it is closed, and I will never go out. <b>closed on me</b> Heb. בַּעֲדִי. cf. (II Kings 4:4) “And you shall close the door about yourself (בַּעֲדֵךְ).” And so is every instance of בְּעַד in Scriptures, e.g. (Job:24) “Skin against (בְּעַד) skin,” a limb against a limb.
<b>forever</b> This refers to what he said above, “And I said, ‘I have been driven away,’” and I said, “The earth - its bars are closed on me forever.”

<b>abandon their kindness</b>—The fear of the Holy One, blessed be He, from Whom all their kindness and benefit emanate, they abandon; but I am not so, but “with a voice of thanks will I sacrifice to You.” In this manner did <i>Jonathan</i> render it. But in <i>Pirk&amp;d’Rabbi Eliezer</i> (ch. 10), they expounded this as an allusion to the sailors who abandoned their kindness that they were bestowing upon the idols and proselytized.

### passuk 10
<b>for the salvation of the Lord</b>—Vows of peace-offerings and thanksgiving offerings I will pay, for the salvation of the Lord. <b>for the salvation</b> Heb. יְשׁוּעָתָה, like לִישׁוּעָה, for the salvation. Cf. (Ps. 44: 27) “Rise for our aid (עֶזְרָתָה),” equivalent to לְעֶזְרָה
