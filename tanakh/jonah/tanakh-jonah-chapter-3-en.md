### passuk 1
And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time, saying:

### passuk 2
’Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and make unto it the proclamation that I bid thee.’

### passuk 3
So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city, of three days’journey.

### passuk 4
And Jonah began to enter into the city a day’s journey, and he proclaimed, and said: ‘Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.’

### passuk 5
And the people of Nineveh believed God; and they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.

### passuk 6
And the tidings reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.

### passuk 7
And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying: ‘Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing; let them not feed, nor drink water;

### passuk 8
but let them be covered with sackcloth, both man and beast, and let them cry mightily unto God; yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands.

### passuk 9
Who knoweth whether God will not turn and repent, and turn away from His fierce anger, that we perish not?’

### passuk 10
And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, which He said He would do unto them; and He did it not.
