### passuk 1
Moreover, take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,

### passuk 2
and say: How was thy mother a lioness; Among lions she couched, In the midst of the young lions She reared her whelps!

### passuk 3
And she brought up one of her whelps, He became a young lion; And he learned to catch the prey, He devoured men.

### passuk 4
Then the nations assembled against him, He was taken in their pit; And they brought him with hooks Unto the land of Egypt.

### passuk 5
Now when she saw that she was disappointed, And her hope was lost, Then she took another of her whelps, And made him a young lion.

### passuk 6
And he went up and down among the lions, He became a young lion; And he learned to catch the prey, He devoured men.

### passuk 7
And he knew their castles, And laid waste their cities; And the land was desolate, And the fulness thereof, Because of the noise of his roaring.

### passuk 8
Then the nations cried out against him On every side from the provinces; And they spread their net over him, He was taken in their pit.

### passuk 9
And they put him in a cage with hooks, And brought him to the king of Babylon; That they might bring him into strongholds, So that his voice should no more be heard Upon the mountains of Israel.

### passuk 10
Thy mother was like a vine, in thy likeness, Planted by the waters; She was fruitful and full of branches By reason of many waters.

### passuk 11
And she had strong rods To be sceptres for them that bore rule; And her stature was exalted Among the thick branches, And she was seen in her height With the multitude of her tendrils.

### passuk 12
But she was plucked up in fury, She was cast down to the ground, And the east wind dried up her fruit; Her strong rods were broken off and withered, The fire consumed her.

### passuk 13
And now she is planted in the wilderness, In a dry and thirsty ground.

### passuk 14
And fire is gone out of the rod of her branches, It hath devoured her fruit, So that there is in her no strong rod To be a sceptre to rule.’ This is a lamentation, and it was for a lamentation.
