### passuk 1
For the Leader. A Song, a Psalm. Shout unto God, all the earth;

### passuk 2
Sing praises unto the glory of His name; Make His praise glorious.

### passuk 3
Say unto God: 'How tremendous is Thy work! Through the greatness of Thy power shall Thine enemies dwindle away before Thee.

### passuk 4
All the earth shall worship Thee, And shall sing praises unto Thee; They shall sing praises to Thy name.' Selah

### passuk 5
Come, and see the works of God; He is terrible in His doing toward the children of men.

### passuk 6
He turned the sea into dry land; They went through the river on foot; There let us rejoice in Him!

### passuk 7
Who ruleth by His might for ever; His eyes keep watch upon the nations; Let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah

### passuk 8
Bless our God, ye peoples, And make the voice of His praise to be heard;

### passuk 9
Who hath set our soul in life, And suffered not our foot to be moved,

### passuk 10
For Thou, O God, hast tried us; Thou hast refined us, as silver is refined.

### passuk 11
Thou didst bring us into the hold; Thou didst lay constraint upon our loins.

### passuk 12
Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; We went through fire and through water; But Thou didst bring us out unto abundance.

### passuk 13
I will come into Thy house with burnt-offerings, I will perform unto Thee my vows,

### passuk 14
Which my lips have uttered, And my mouth hath spoken, when I was in distress.

### passuk 15
I will offer unto Thee burnt-offerings of fatlings, With the sweet smoke of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah

### passuk 16
Come, and hearken, all ye that fear God, And I will declare what He hath done for my soul.

### passuk 17
I cried unto Him with my mouth, And He was extolled with my tongue.

### passuk 18
If I had regarded iniquity in my heart, The Lord would not hear;

### passuk 19
But verily God hath heard; He hath attended to the voice of my prayer.

### passuk 20
Blessed be God, Who hath not turned away my prayer, nor His mercy from me.
