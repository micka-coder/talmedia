### passuk 1
A Song of Ascents. I will lift up mine eyes unto the mountains: From whence shall my help come?

### passuk 2
My help cometh from the LORD, Who made heaven and earth.

### passuk 3
He will not suffer thy foot to be moved; He that keepeth thee will not slumber.

### passuk 4
Behold, He that keepeth Israel Doth neither slumber nor sleep.

### passuk 5
The LORD is thy keeper; The LORD is thy shade upon thy right hand.

### passuk 6
The sun shall not smite thee by day, Nor the moon by night.

### passuk 7
The LORD shall keep thee from all evil; He shall keep thy soul.

### passuk 8
The LORD shall guard thy going out and thy coming in, From this time forth and for ever.
