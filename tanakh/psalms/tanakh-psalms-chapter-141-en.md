### passuk 1
A Psalm of David. LORD, I have called Thee; make haste unto me; Give ear unto my voice, when I call unto Thee.

### passuk 2
Let my prayer be set forth as incense before Thee, The lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.

### passuk 3
Set a guard, O LORD, to my mouth; Keep watch at the door of my lips.

### passuk 4
Incline not my heart to any evil thing, To be occupied in deeds of wickedness With men that work iniquity; And let me not eat of their dainties.

### passuk 5
Let the righteous smite me in kindness, and correct me; Oil so choice let not my head refuse; For still is my prayer because of their wickedness.

### passuk 6
Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock; And they shall hear my words, that they are sweet.

### passuk 7
As when one cleaveth and breaketh up the earth, Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth.

### passuk 8
For mine eyes are unto Thee, O GOD the Lord; In Thee have I taken refuge, O pour not out my soul.

### passuk 9
Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me, And from the gins of the workers of iniquity.

### passuk 10
Let the wicked fall into their own nets, Whilst I withal escape.
