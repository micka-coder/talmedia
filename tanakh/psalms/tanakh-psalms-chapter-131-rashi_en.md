### passuk 1
<b>my heart was not haughty, etc.</b> I did not behave with superiority. I did not make great things pleasures, buildings, and plantings as my son made. Behold I am with You like one who has no hands or feet, like an incomplete form lying before You.

### passuk 2
<b>I calmed and quieted</b> my soul upon You, like a suckling who is placed upon his mother. גָמוּל is one who sucks the breasts.
<b>like a suckling was my soul with me</b> My soul within me was before You as an infant sucking its mother’s breasts.
