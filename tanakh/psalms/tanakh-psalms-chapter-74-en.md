### passuk 1
Maschil of Asaph. Why, O God, hast Thou cast us off for ever? Why doth Thine anger smoke against the flock of Thy pasture?

### passuk 2
Remember Thy congregation, which Thou hast gotten of old, Which Thou hast redeemed to be the tribe of Thine inheritance; And mount Zion, wherein Thou hast dwelt.

### passuk 3
Lift up Thy steps because of the perpetual ruins, Even all the evil that the enemy hath done in the sanctuary.

### passuk 4
Thine adversaries have roared in the midst of Thy meeting-place; They have set up their own signs for signs.

### passuk 5
It seemed as when men wield upwards Axes in a thicket of trees.

### passuk 6
And now all the carved work thereof together They strike down with hatchet and hammers.

### passuk 7
They have set Thy sanctuary on fire; They have profaned the dwelling-place of Thy name even to the ground.

### passuk 8
They said in their heart: 'Let us make havoc of them altogether'; They have burned up all the meeting-places of God in the land.

### passuk 9
We see not our signs; There is no more any prophet; Neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.

### passuk 10
How long, O God, shall the adversary reproach? Shall the enemy blaspheme Thy name for ever?

### passuk 11
Why withdrawest Thou Thy hand, even Thy right hand? Draw it out of Thy bosom and consume them.

### passuk 12
Yet God is my King of old, Working salvation in the midst of the earth.

### passuk 13
Thou didst break the sea in pieces by Thy strength; Thou didst shatter the heads of the sea-monsters in the waters.

### passuk 14
Thou didst crush the heads of leviathan, Thou gavest him to be food to the folk inhabiting the wilderness.

### passuk 15
Thou didst cleave fountain and brook; Thou driedst up ever-flowing rivers.

### passuk 16
Thine is the day, Thine also the night; Thou hast established luminary and sun.

### passuk 17
Thou hast set all the borders of the earth; Thou hast made summer and winter.

### passuk 18
Remember this, how the enemy hath reproached the LORD, And how a base people have blasphemed Thy name.

### passuk 19
O deliver not the soul of Thy turtle-dove unto the wild beast; Forget not the life of Thy poor for ever.

### passuk 20
Look upon the covenant; For the dark places of the land are full of the habitations of violence.

### passuk 21
O let not the oppressed turn back in confusion; Let the poor and needy praise Thy name.

### passuk 22
Arise, O God, plead Thine own cause; Remember Thy reproach all the day at the hand of the base man.

### passuk 23
Forget not the voice of Thine adversaries, The tumult of those that rise up against Thee which ascendeth continually.
