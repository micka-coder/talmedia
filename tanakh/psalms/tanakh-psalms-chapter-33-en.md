Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous, Praise is comely for the upright.

Give thanks unto the LORD with harp, Sing praises unto Him with the psaltery of ten strings.

### passuk 3
Sing unto Him a new song; Play skilfully amid shouts of joy.

### passuk 4
For the word of the LORD is upright; And all His work is done in faithfulness.

### passuk 5
He loveth righteousness and justice; The earth is full of the lovingkindness of the LORD.

### passuk 6
By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; And all the host of them by the breath of His mouth.

### passuk 7
He gathereth the waters of the sea together as a heap; He layeth up the deeps in storehouses.

### passuk 8
Let all the earth fear the LORD; Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him.

### passuk 9
For He spoke, and it was; He commanded, and it stood.

### passuk 10
The LORD bringeth the counsel of the nations to nought; He maketh the thoughts of the peoples to be of no effect.

The LORD looketh from heaven; He beholdeth all the sons of men;

### passuk 14
From the place of His habitation He looketh intently Upon all the inhabitants of the earth;

### passuk 15
He that fashioneth the hearts of them all, That considereth all their doings.

### passuk 18
Behold, the eye of the LORD is toward them that fear Him, Toward them that wait for His mercy;

### passuk 19
To deliver their soul from death, And to keep them alive in famine.

### passuk 20
Our soul hath waited for the LORD; He is our help and our shield.

### passuk 21
For in Him doth our heart rejoice, Because we have trusted in His holy name.

### passuk 22
Let Thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, According as we have waited for Thee.
