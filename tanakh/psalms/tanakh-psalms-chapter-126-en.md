### passuk 1
A Song of Ascents. When the LORD brought back those that returned to Zion, We were like unto them that dream.

### passuk 2
Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing; then said they among the nations: 'The LORD hath done great things with these.'

### passuk 3
The LORD hath done great things with us; we are rejoiced.

### passuk 4
Turn our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the dry land.

### passuk 5
They that sow in tears Shall reap in joy.

### passuk 6
Though he goeth on his way weeping that beareth the measure of seed, He shall come home with joy, bearing his sheaves.
