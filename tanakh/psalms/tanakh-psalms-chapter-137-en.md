### passuk 1
By the rivers of Babylon, There we sat down, yea, we wept, When we remembered Zion.

### passuk 2
Upon the willows in the midst thereof We hanged up our harps.

### passuk 3
For there they that led us captive asked of us words of song, And our tormentors asked of us mirth: ‘Sing us one of the songs of Zion.'

### passuk 4
How shall we sing the LORD’S song In a foreign land?

### passuk 5
If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, Let my right hand forget her cunning.

### passuk 6
Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, If I remember thee not; If I set not Jerusalem Above my chiefest joy.

### passuk 7
Remember, O LORD, against the children of Edom The day of Jerusalem; Who said: 'Rase it, rase it, Even to the foundation thereof.'

### passuk 8
O daughter of Babylon, that art to be destroyed; Happy shall he be, that repayeth thee As thou hast served us.

### passuk 9
Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones Against the rock.
