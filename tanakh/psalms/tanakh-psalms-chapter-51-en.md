For the Leader. A Psalm of David;

### passuk 2
when Nathan the prophet came unto him, after he had gone in to Bath-sheba.

### passuk 3
Be gracious unto me, O God, according to Thy mercy; According to the multitude of Thy compassions blot out my transgressions.

### passuk 4
Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, And cleanse me from my sin.

### passuk 5
For I know my transgressions; And my sin is ever before me.

### passuk 6
Against Thee, Thee only, have I sinned, And done that which is evil in Thy sight; That Thou mayest be justified when Thou speakest, And be in the right when Thou judgest.

### passuk 7
Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.

### passuk 8
Behold, Thou desirest truth in the inward parts; make me, therefore, to know wisdom in mine inmost heart.

### passuk 9
Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

### passuk 10
Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which Thou hast crushed may rejoice.

### passuk 11
Hide Thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.

### passuk 12
Create me a clean heart, O God; and renew a stedfast spirit within me.

### passuk 13
Cast me not away from Thy presence; and take not Thy holy spirit from me.

### passuk 14
Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation; and let a willing spirit uphold me.

### passuk 15
Then will I teach transgressors Thy ways; and sinners shall return unto Thee. .

### passuk 16
Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, Thou God of my salvation; so shall my tongue sing aloud of Thy righteousness.

### passuk 17
O Lord, open Thou my lips; and my mouth shall declare Thy praise.

### passuk 18
For Thou delightest not in sacrifice, else would I give it; Thou hast no pleasure in burnt-offering.

### passuk 19
The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God, Thou wilt not despise.

### passuk 20
Do good in Thy favour unto Zion; build Thou the walls of Jerusalem.

### passuk 21
Then wilt Thou delight in the sacrifices of righteousness, in burnt-offering and whole offering; Then will they offer bullocks upon Thine altar.
