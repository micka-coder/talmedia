### passuk 1
A Song of Ascents; of David. 'If it had not been the LORD who was for us', Let Israel now say;

### passuk 2
'If it had not been the LORD who was for us, When men rose up against us,

### passuk 3
Then they had swallowed us up alive, when their wrath was kindled against us;

### passuk 4
Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul;

### passuk 5
Then the proud waters Had gone over our soul.'

### passuk 6
Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth.

### passuk 7
Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers; The snare is broken, and we are escaped.

### passuk 8
Our help is in the name of the LORD, Who made heaven and earth.
