### passuk 1
In Thee, O LORD, have I taken refuge; Let me never be ashamed.

### passuk 2
Deliver me in Thy righteousness, and rescue me; Incline Thine ear unto me, and save me.

### passuk 3
Be Thou to me a sheltering rock, whereunto I may continually resort, Which Thou hast appointed to save me; For Thou art my rock and my fortress.

### passuk 4
O my God, rescue me out of the hand of the wicked, Out of the grasp of the unrighteous and ruthless man.

### passuk 5
For Thou art my hope; O Lord GOD, my trust from my youth.

### passuk 6
Upon Thee have I stayed myself from birth; Thou art he that took me out of my mother's womb; My praise is continually of Thee.

### passuk 7
I am as a wonder unto many; But Thou art my strong refuge.

### passuk 8
My mouth shall be filled with Thy praise, And with Thy glory all the day. .

### passuk 9
Cast me not off in the time of old age; When my strength faileth, forsake me not.

### passuk 10
For mine enemies speak concerning me, And they that watch for my soul take counsel together,

### passuk 11
Saying: 'God hath forsaken him; Pursue and take him; for there is none to deliver.'

### passuk 12
O God, be not far from me; O my God, make haste to help me.

### passuk 13
Let them be ashamed and consumed that are adversaries to my soul; Let them be covered with reproach and confusion that seek my hurt.

### passuk 14
But as for me, I will hope continually, And will praise Thee yet more and more.

### passuk 15
My mouth shall tell of Thy righteousness, And of Thy salvation all the day; For I know not the numbers thereof.

### passuk 16
I will come with Thy mighty acts, O Lord GOD; I will make mention of Thy righteousness, even of Thine only.

### passuk 17
O God, Thou hast taught me from my youth; And until now do I declare Thy wondrous works.

### passuk 18
And even unto old age and hoary hairs, O God, forsake me not; Until I have declared Thy strength unto the next generation, Thy might to every one that is to come.

### passuk 19
Thy righteousness also, O God, which reacheth unto high heaven; Thou who hast done great things, O God, who is like unto Thee?

### passuk 20
Thou, who hast made me to see many and sore troubles, Wilt quicken me again, and bring me up again from the depths of the earth.

### passuk 21
Thou wilt increase my greatness, And turn and comfort me.

### passuk 22
I also will give thanks unto Thee with the psaltery, Even unto Thy truth, O my God; I will sing praises unto Thee with the harp, O Thou Holy One of Israel.

### passuk 23
My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing praises unto Thee; And my soul, which Thou hast redeemed.

### passuk 24
My tongue also shall tell of Thy righteousness all the day; For they are ashamed, for they are abashed, that seek my hurt.
