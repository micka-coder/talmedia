For the Leader. A Psalm of David.

### passuk 2
How long, O LORD, wilt Thou forget me for ever? How long wilt Thou hide Thy face from me?

### passuk 3
How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart by day? How long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?

### passuk 4
Behold Thou, and answer me, O LORD my God; Lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death;

### passuk 5
Lest mine enemy say: 'I have prevailed against him'; Lest mine adversaries rejoice when I am moved.

### passuk 6
But as for me, in Thy mercy do I trust; My heart shall rejoice in Thy salvation. I will sing unto the LORD, Because He hath dealt bountifully with me.
