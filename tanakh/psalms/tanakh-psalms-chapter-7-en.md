### passuk 1
Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto the LORD, concerning Cush a Benjamite.

### passuk 2
O LORD my God, in Thee have I taken refuge; Save me from all them that pursue me, and deliver me;

### passuk 3
Lest he tear my soul like a lion, Rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.

### passuk 4
O LORD my God, if I have done this; If there be iniquity in my hands;

### passuk 5
If I have requited him that did evil unto me, Or spoiled mine adversary unto emptiness;

### passuk 6
Let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it, And tread my life down to the earth; Yea, let him lay my glory in the dust. Selah

### passuk 7
Arise, O LORD, in Thine anger, Lift up Thyself in indignation against mine adversaries; Yea, awake for me at the judgment which Thou hast commanded.

### passuk 8
And let the congregation of the peoples compass Thee about, And over them return Thou on high.

### passuk 9
O LORD, who ministerest judgment to the peoples, Judge me, O LORD, According to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me.

### passuk 10
Oh that a full measure of evil might come upon the wicked, And that Thou wouldest establish the righteous; For the righteous God trieth the heart and reins.

### passuk 11
My shield is with God, Who saveth the upright in heart.

### passuk 12
God is a righteous judge, Yea, a God that hath indignation every day:

### passuk 13
If a man turn not, He will whet His sword, He hath bent His bow, and made it ready;

### passuk 14
He hath also prepared for him the weapons of death, Yea, His arrows which He made sharp.

### passuk 15
Behold, he travaileth with iniquity; Yea, he conceiveth mischief, and bringeth forth falsehood.

### passuk 16
He hath digged a pit, and hollowed it, And is fallen into the ditch which he made.

### passuk 17
His mischief shall return upon his own head, And his violence shall come down upon his own pate.

### passuk 18
I will give thanks unto the LORD according to His righteousness; And will sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High.
