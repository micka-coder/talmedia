### passuk 1
A Song of Ascents; of David. LORD, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty; Neither do I exercise myself in things too great, or in things too wonderful for me.

### passuk 2
Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul; Like a weaned child with his mother; My soul is with me like a weaned child.

### passuk 3
O Israel, hope in the LORD From this time forth and for ever.
