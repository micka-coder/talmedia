### passuk 1
For the Leader; with string-music. Maschil of David.

### passuk 2
Give ear, O God, to my prayer; And hide not Thyself from my supplication.

### passuk 3
Attend unto me, and hear me; I am distraught in my complaint, and will moan;

### passuk 4
Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked; For they cast mischief upon me, and in anger they persecute me.

### passuk 5
My heart doth writhe within me; and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.

### passuk 6
Fear and trembling come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me.

### passuk 7
And I said: 'Oh that I had wings like a dove! Then would I fly away, and be at rest.

### passuk 8
Lo, then would I wander far off, I would lodge in the wilderness. Selah

### passuk 9
I would haste me to a shelter from the stormy wind and tempest.'

### passuk 10
Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongue; For I have seen violence and strife in the city.

### passuk 11
Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof; iniquity also and mischief are in the midst of it.

### passuk 12
Wickedness is in the midst thereof; oppression and guile depart not from her broad place.

### passuk 13
For it was not an enemy that taunted me, Then I could have borne it; Neither was it mine adversary that did magnify himself against me, Then I would have hid myself from him.

### passuk 14
But it was thou, a man mine equal, My companion, and my familiar friend;

### passuk 15
We took sweet counsel together, In the house of God we walked with the throng.

### passuk 16
May He incite death against them, Let them go down alive into the nether-world; For evil is in their dwelling, and within them.

### passuk 17
As for me, I will call upon God; And the LORD shall save me.

### passuk 18
Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I complain, and moan; And He hath heard my voice.

### passuk 19
He hath redeemed my soul in peace so that none came nigh me; For they were many that strove with me.

### passuk 20
God shall hear, and humble them, even He that is enthroned of old, Selah, such as have no changes, and fear not God.

### passuk 21
He hath put forth his hands against them that were at peace with him; He hath profaned his covenant.

### passuk 22
Smoother than cream were the speeches of his mouth, But his heart was war; His words were softer than oil, Yet were they keen-edged swords.

### passuk 23
Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and He will sustain thee; He will never suffer the righteous to be moved.

### passuk 24
But Thou, O God, wilt bring them down into the nethermost pit; Men of blood and deceit shall not live out half their days; But as for me, I will trust in Thee.
