### passuk 1
Maschil of David, when he was in the cave; a Prayer.

### passuk 2
With my voice I cry unto the LORD; With my voice I make supplication unto the LORD.

### passuk 3
I pour out my complaint before Him, I declare before Him my trouble;

### passuk 4
When my spirit fainteth within me— Thou knowest my path— In the way wherein I walk Have they hidden a snare for me.

### passuk 5
Look on my right hand, and see, For there is no man that knoweth me; I have no way to flee; No man careth for my soul.

### passuk 6
I have cried unto Thee, O LORD; I have said: 'Thou art my refuge, My portion in the land of the living.'

### passuk 7
Attend unto my cry; For I am brought very low; Deliver me from my persecutors; For they are too strong for me.

### passuk 8
Bring my soul out of prison, That I may give thanks unto Thy name; The righteous shall crown themselves because of me; For Thou wilt deal bountifully with me.
