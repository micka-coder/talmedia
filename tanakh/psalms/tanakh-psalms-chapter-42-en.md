For the Leader; Maschil of the sons of Korah.

### passuk 2
As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after Thee, O God.

### passuk 3
My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: 'When shall I come and appear before God?'

### passuk 4
My tears have been my food day and night, while they say unto me all the day: 'Where is Thy God?'

### passuk 5
These things I remember, and pour out my soul within me, how I passed on with the throng, and led them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping holyday.

### passuk 6
Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And why moanest thou within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise Him for the salvation of His countenance.

### passuk 7
O my God, my soul is cast down within me; therefore do I remember Thee from the land of Jordan, and the Hermons, from the hill Mizar.

### passuk 8
Deep calleth unto deep at the voice of Thy cataracts; all Thy waves and Thy billows are gone over me.

### passuk 9
By day the LORD will command His lovingkindness, and in the night His song shall be with me, even a prayer unto the God of my life.

### passuk 10
I will say unto God my Rock: 'Why hast Thou forgotten me? Why go I mourning under the oppression of the enemy?'

### passuk 11
As with a crushing in my bones, mine adversaries taunt me; while they say unto me all the day: 'Where is Thy God?'

### passuk 12
Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And why moanest thou within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise Him, the salvation of my countenance, and my God.
