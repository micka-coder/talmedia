[A Psalm] of Solomon. Give the king Thy judgments, O God, and Thy righteousness unto the king's son;

### passuk 2
That he may judge Thy people with righteousness, and Thy poor with justice.

### passuk 3
Let the mountains bear peace to the people, and the hills, through righteousness.

### passuk 4
May he judge the poor of the people, and save the children of the needy, And crush the oppressor.

### passuk 5
They shall fear Thee while the sun endureth, and so long as the moon, throughout all generations.

### passuk 6
May he come down like rain upon the mown grass, as showers that water the earth.

### passuk 7
In his days let the righteous flourish, and abundance of peace, till the moon be no more.

### passuk 8
May he have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the River unto the ends of the earth.

### passuk 9
Let them that dwell in the wilderness bow before him; and his enemies lick the dust.

### passuk 10
The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall render tribute; the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.

### passuk 11
Yea, all kings shall prostrate themselves before him; All nations shall serve him.

### passuk 12
For he will deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and him that hath no helper.

### passuk 13
He will have pity on the poor and needy, And the souls of the needy he will save.

### passuk 14
He will redeem their soul from oppression and violence, And precious will their blood be in his sight.

### passuk 15
That they may live, and that he may give them of the gold of Sheba, That they may pray for him continually, Yea, bless him all the day.

### passuk 16
May he be as a rich cornfield in the land upon the top of the mountains; May his fruit rustle like Lebanon; And may they blossom out of the city like grass of the earth.

### passuk 17
May his name endure for ever; May his name be continued as long as the sun; May men also bless themselves by him; May all nations call him happy.

### passuk 18
Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, Who only doeth wondrous things;

### passuk 19
And blessed be His glorious name for ever; And let the whole earth be filled with His glory. Amen, and Amen.

### passuk 20
The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.
