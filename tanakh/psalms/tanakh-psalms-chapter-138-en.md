[A Psalm] of David. I will give Thee thanks with my whole heart, In the presence of the mighty will I sing praises unto Thee.

### passuk 2
I will bow down toward Thy holy temple, And give thanks unto Thy name for Thy mercy and for Thy truth; For Thou hast magnified Thy word above all Thy name.

In the day that I called, Thou didst answer me; Thou didst encourage me in my soul with strength.

### passuk 4
All the kings of the earth shall give Thee thanks, O LORD, For they have heard the words of Thy mouth.

### passuk 5
Yea, they shall sing of the ways of the LORD; For great is the glory of the LORD.

### passuk 6
For though the LORD be high, yet regardeth He the lowly, And the haughty He knoweth from afar.

Though I walk in the midst of trouble, Thou quickenest me; Thou stretchest forth Thy hand against the wrath of mine enemies, And Thy right hand doth save me.

### passuk 8
The LORD will accomplish that which concerneth me; Thy mercy, O LORD, endureth for ever; Forsake not the work of Thine own hands.
