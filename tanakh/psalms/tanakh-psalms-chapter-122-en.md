A Song of Ascents; of David. I rejoiced when they said unto me: 'Let us go unto the house of the LORD.'

Our feet are standing within thy gates, O Jerusalem;

### passuk 3
Jerusalem, that art builded as a city that is compact together;

### passuk 4
Whither the tribes went up, even the tribes of the LORD, as a testimony unto Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD.

### passuk 5

Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces.

### passuk 8
For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say: 'Peace be within thee.'

For the sake of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good.
