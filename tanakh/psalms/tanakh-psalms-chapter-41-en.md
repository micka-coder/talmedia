For the Leader. A Psalm of David. 

### passuk 2
Happy is he that considereth the poor; the LORD will deliver him in the day of evil.

### passuk 3
The LORD preserve him, and keep him alive, let him be called happy in the land; and deliver not Thou him unto the greed of his enemies.

### passuk 4
The LORD support him upon the bed of illness; mayest Thou turn all his lying down in his sickness.

### passuk 5
As for me, I said: 'O LORD, be gracious unto me; heal my soul; for I have sinned against Thee.'

### passuk 6
Mine enemies speak evil of me: 'When shall he die, and his name perish?'

### passuk 7
And if one come to see me, he speaketh falsehood; His heart gathereth iniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he speaketh of it.

### passuk 8
All that hate me whisper together against me, against me do they devise my hurt:

### passuk 9
'An evil thing cleaveth fast unto him; and now that he lieth, he shall rise up no more.'

### passuk 10
Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, who did eat of my bread, Hath lifted up his heel against me.

### passuk 11
But Thou, O LORD, be gracious unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite them.

### passuk 12
By this I know that Thou delightest in me, that mine enemy doth not triumph over me.

### passuk 13
And as for me, Thou upholdest me because of mine integrity, and settest me before Thy face for ever.

### passuk 14
Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen.
