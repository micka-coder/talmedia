For the Leader; upon Aijeleth ha-Shahar. A Psalm of David.

### passuk 2
My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me, and art far from my help at the words of my cry?

### passuk 3
O my God, I call by day, but Thou answerest not; and at night, and there is no surcease for me.

### passuk 4
Yet Thou art holy, O Thou that art enthroned upon the praises of Israel.

### passuk 5
In Thee did our fathers trust; they trusted, and Thou didst deliver them.

### passuk 6
Unto Thee they cried, and escaped; in Thee did they trust, and were not ashamed.

### passuk 7
But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.

### passuk 8
All they that see me laugh me to scorn; they shoot out the lip, they shake the head:

### passuk 9
'Let him commit himself unto the LORD! let Him rescue him; let Him deliver him, seeing He delighteth in him.'

### passuk 10
For Thou art He that took me out of the womb; Thou madest me trust when I was upon my mother's breasts.

### passuk 11
Upon Thee I have been cast from my birth; Thou art my God from my mother's womb.

### passuk 12
Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to help.

### passuk 13
Many bulls have encompassed me; strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.

### passuk 14
They open wide their mouth against me, as a ravening and a roaring lion.

### passuk 15
I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint; my heart is become like wax; it is melted in mine inmost parts.

### passuk 16
My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my throat; and Thou layest me in the dust of death.

### passuk 17
For dogs have encompassed me; a company of evil-doers have inclosed me; like a lion, they are at my hands and my feet.

### passuk 18
I may count all my bones; they look and gloat over me.

### passuk 19
They part my garments among them, and for my vesture do they cast lots.

### passuk 20
But Thou, O LORD, be not far off; O Thou my strength, hasten to help me.

### passuk 21
Deliver my soul from the sword; mine only one from the power of the dog.

### passuk 22
Save me from the lion's mouth; yea, from the horns of the wild-oxen do Thou answer me.

### passuk 23
I will declare Thy name unto my brethren; in the midst of the congregation will I praise Thee.

### passuk 24
'Ye that fear the LORD, praise Him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify Him; and stand in awe of Him, all ye the seed of Israel.

### passuk 25
For He hath not despised nor abhorred the lowliness of the poor; neither hath He hid His face from him; but when he cried unto Him, He heard.'

### passuk 26
From Thee cometh my praise in the great congregation; I will pay my vows before them that fear Him.

### passuk 27
Let the humble eat and be satisfied; let them praise the LORD that seek after Him; may your heart be quickened for ever!

### passuk 28
All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto the LORD; and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before Thee.

### passuk 29
For the kingdom is the LORDâ€™S; and He is the ruler over the nations.

### passuk 30
All the fat ones of the earth shall eat and worship; all they that go down to the dust shall kneel before Him, even he that cannot keep his soul alive.

### passuk 31
A seed shall serve him; It shall be told of the Lord unto the next generation.

### passuk 32
They shall come and shall declare His righteousness Unto a people that shall be born, that He hath done it.
