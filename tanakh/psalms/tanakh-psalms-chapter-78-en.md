### passuk 1
Maschil of Asaph. Give ear, O my people, to my teaching; Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.

### passuk 2
I will open my mouth with a parable; I will utter dark sayings concerning days of old;

### passuk 3
That which we have heard and known, And our fathers have told us,

### passuk 4
We will not hide from their children, Telling to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, And His strength, and His wondrous works that He hath done. .

### passuk 5
For He established a testimony in Jacob, And appointed a law in Israel, Which He commanded our fathers, That they should make them known to their children;

### passuk 6
That the generation to come might know them, even the children that should be born; Who should arise and tell them to their children,

### passuk 7
That they might put their confidence in God, And not forget the works of God, But keep His commandments;

### passuk 8
And might not be as their fathers, A stubborn and rebellious generation; A generation that set not their heart aright, And whose spirit was not stedfast with God.

### passuk 9
The children of Ephraim were as archers handling the bow, That turned back in the day of battle.

### passuk 10
They kept not the covenant of God, And refused to walk in His law;

### passuk 11
And they forgot His doings, And His wondrous works that He had shown them.

### passuk 12
Marvellous things did He in the sight of their fathers, In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.

### passuk 13
He cleaved the sea, and caused them to pass through; And He made the waters to stand as a heap.

### passuk 14
By day also He led them with a cloud, And all the night with a light of fire.

### passuk 15
He cleaved rocks in the wilderness, And gave them drink abundantly as out of the great deep.

### passuk 16
He brought streams also out of the rock, And caused waters to run down like rivers.

### passuk 17
Yet went they on still to sin against Him, To rebel against the Most High in the desert.

### passuk 18
And they tried God in their heart By asking food for their craving.

### passuk 19
Yea, they spoke against God; They said 'Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?

### passuk 20
Behold, He smote the rock, that waters gushed out, And streams overflowed; Can He give bread also? Or will He provide flesh for His people?'

### passuk 21
Therefore the LORD heard, and was wroth; And a fire was kindled against Jacob, And anger also went up against Israel;

### passuk 22
Because they believed not in God, And trusted not in His salvation.

### passuk 23
And He commanded the skies above, And opened the doors of heaven;

### passuk 24
And He caused manna to rain upon them for food, And gave them of the corn of heaven.

### passuk 25
Man did eat the bread of the mighty; He sent them provisions to the full.

### passuk 26
He caused the east wind to set forth in heaven; And by His power He brought on the south wind.

### passuk 27
He caused flesh also to rain upon them as the dust, And winged fowl as the sand of the seas;

### passuk 28
And He let it fall in the midst of their camp, Round about their dwellings.

### passuk 29
So they did eat, and were well filled; And He gave them that which they craved.

### passuk 30
They were not estranged from their craving, Their food was yet in their mouths,

### passuk 31
When the anger of God went up against them, And slew of the lustieth among them, And smote down the young men of Israel.

### passuk 32
For all this they sinned still, And believed not in His wondrous works.

### passuk 33
Therefore He ended their days as a breath, And their years in terror.

### passuk 34
When He slew them, then they would inquire after Him, And turn back and seek God earnestly.

### passuk 35
And they remembered that God was their Rock, And the Most High God their redeemer.

### passuk 36
But they beguiled Him with their mouth, And lied unto Him with their tongue.

### passuk 37
For their heart was not stedfast with Him, Neither were they faithful in His covenant.

### passuk 38
But He, being full of compassion, forgiveth iniquity, and destroyeth not; Yea, many a time doth He turn His anger away, And doth not stir up all His wrath.

### passuk 39
So He remembered that they were but flesh, A wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.

### passuk 40
How oft did they rebel against Him in the wilderness, And grieve Him in the desert!

### passuk 41
And still again they tried God, And set bounds to the Holy One of Israel.

### passuk 42
They remembered not His hand, Nor the day when He redeemed them from the adversary.

### passuk 43
How He set His signs in Egypt, And His wonders in the field of Zoan; .

### passuk 44
And turned their rivers into blood, So that they could not drink their streams.

### passuk 45
He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; And frogs, which destroyed them.

### passuk 46
He gave also their increase unto the caterpillar, And their labour unto the locust.

### passuk 47
He destroyed their vines with hail, And their sycamore-trees with frost.

### passuk 48
He gave over their cattle also to the hail, And their flocks to fiery bolts.

### passuk 49
He sent forth upon them the fierceness of His anger, Wrath, and indignation, and trouble, A sending of messengers of evil.

### passuk 50
He levelled a path for His anger; He spared not their soul from death, But gave their life over to the pestilence;

### passuk 51
And smote all the first-born in Egypt, The first-fruits of their strength in the tents of Ham;

### passuk 52
But He made His own people to go forth like sheep, And guided them in the wilderness like a flock.

### passuk 53
And He led them safely, and they feared not; But the sea overwhelmed their enemies.

### passuk 54
And He brought them to His holy border, To the mountain, which His right hand had gotten.

### passuk 55
He drove out the nations also before them, And allotted them for an inheritance by line, And made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.

### passuk 56
Yet they tried and provoked God, the Most High, And kept not His testimonies;

### passuk 57
But turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers; They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.

### passuk 58
For they provoked Him with their high places, And moved Him to jealousy with their graven images.

### passuk 59
God heard, and was wroth, And He greatly abhorred Israel;

### passuk 60
And He forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, The tent which He had made to dwell among men;

### passuk 61
And delivered His strength into captivity, And His glory into the adversary's hand.

### passuk 62
He gave His people over also unto the sword; And was wroth with His inheritance.

### passuk 63
Fire devoured their young men; And their virgins had no marriage-song.

### passuk 64
Their priests fell by the sword; And their widows made no lamentation. .

### passuk 65
Then the Lord awaked as one asleep, Like a mighty man recovering from wine.

### passuk 66
And He smote His adversaries backward; He put upon them a perpetual reproach.

### passuk 67
Moreover He abhorred the tent of Joseph, And chose not the tribe of Ephraim;

### passuk 68
But chose the tribe of Judah, The mount Zion which He loved.

### passuk 69
And He built His sanctuary like the heights, Like the earth which He hath founded for ever.

### passuk 70
He chose David also His servant, And took him from the sheepfolds;

### passuk 71
From following the ewes that give suck He brought him, To be shepherd over Jacob His people, and Israel His inheritance.

### passuk 72
So he shepherded them according to the integrity of his heart; And lead them by the skilfulness of his hands.
