### passuk 1
Be Thou my judge, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation; O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.

### passuk 2
For Thou art the God of my strength; why hast Thou cast me off? Why go I mourning under the oppression of the enemy?

### passuk 3
O send out Thy light and Thy truth; let them lead me; Let them bring me unto Thy holy mountain, and to Thy dwelling-places.

### passuk 4
Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God, my exceeding joy; And praise Thee upon the harp, O God, my God.

### passuk 5
Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And why moanest thou within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise Him, The salvation of my countenance, and my God.
