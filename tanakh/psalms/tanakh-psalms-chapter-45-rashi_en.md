<b>a maskil</b> Through an interpreter.
<b>a song of loves</b> Heb. שיר ידידות, a song of loves, a song of praise for them [the Torah scholars] to endear them to the people and to endear their Torah to them [the people].

### passuk 2
<b>My heart is astir</b> In this manner, the Psalmist commenced his song: My heart caused a good theme to swarm within me in your praise, O Torah scholar.
<b>is astir</b> Heb. רחש, an expression of moving, and so is every expression of swarming and crawling.
<b>I say, “My works are for a king”</b> This song, which I have founded and composed, I say to one who is fit to be a king, as it is stated (Prov. 8:15): “Kings reign with me.”
<b>my tongue is</b> as poetic as the pen of an expert scribe. I saw in the commentary of Rabbi Moses the Preacher: מָהִיר in Arabic means expert.

### passuk 3
<b>You are more handsome than [other] men</b> who engage in the work of transitory life. Why? Because charm is poured into your lips to instruct according to the halachah. הוּצַק means “poured,” as (Exod. 38:27): “to cast (לצקת)”; (Gen. 28:18), “and he poured (ויצק) oil.”
<b>Therefore...blessed you</b> as it is stated (below 29:11): “The Lord shall grant strength to His people.” And what is their reward? “The Lord shall bless His people with peace.”

### passuk 4

### passuk 5
<b>for the sake of truth</b> To instruct according to the law and to behave with righteous humility.
<b>and it shall instruct you</b> The Torah and the matter of truth in which you shall engage shall teach you tactics of war so that your right should perform awesome things. Since he mentions the study of Torah in an expression of war, the expression of the right hand, prepared to fight, is appropriate (i.e., it is customary to fight with the right hand).

### passuk 6
<b>Your arrows are sharpened, etc., in the heart of the king’s enemies</b> Heb. שְּׁנוּנִים, is aiguises in French, sharpened. This is a transposed verse. We find that the disciples are called arrows, as it is stated (above 127:4): “As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the children of youth.” And Torah scholars who argue with each other about halachah are called enemies to each other for the time, as it is stated: “they will not be ashamed when they speak with the enemies in the gate.”
<b>nations shall fall under you</b> As a reward for Torah, nations shall fall under Israel.

### passuk 7
<b>Your throne, O judge</b> Your throne, O prince and judge, shall exist forever and ever, as the matter that is stated (Exod. 7:1): “I have made you a judge (נתתיך אלהים) over Pharaoh.” And why? Because “a scepter of equity is the scepter of your kingdom,” that your judgments are true, and you are fit to govern.

### passuk 10
<b>The daughters of kings</b> will visit you, as the matter that is stated (Isa. 49:23): “and their princesses your wet nurses.”
<b>will visit you</b> lit. your visitors. Heb. ביקרותיך. The “kaph” is punctuated with a “dagesh” because it is an expression of visiting, although it is preceded by a “yud.” I saw in Rav Saadia’s punctuation that this word is arranged with (Isa. 42:24), “Who subjected Jacob to plunder (למשיסה),” which is written with a “yud” although the “sammech” is punctuated with a “dagesh.” Menachem, however, associated it as an expression of value, as (Job 28:16): “with precious (יקר) onyx.
<b>the queen</b> Heb. שגל, the queen, as (Neh. 2:6): “and the queen (השגל) was sitting beside him”; (Dan. 5:2), “and they shall drink with them, the king and his nobles, his queen (שגלתה) and his concubines.” Your wife will stand at your right.

### passuk 14
<b>All honor [awaits] the King’s daughter who is within, etc.</b> Those who deserve all honor, and they are the nation of the King, who behaved with modesty now their garments will be more esteemed than the settings of gold of the High Priests. משבצוֹת is chatons in French, settings.

### passuk 15
