<b>in the lands of the living</b> The land of Israel, for my enemies and my pursuers chased me out of it in the days of Saul, and against their will, I returned.

### passuk 10
<b>I believed so that I spoke</b> I believed the words of Ziba which he spoke about Mephibosheth, so that I should say (II Sam. 16:4), “Behold, all that belongs to Mephibosheth is yours.” Then I humbled myself exceedingly. I had spoken harshly, and I submitted myself to you [Mephibosheth].

### passuk 11
<b>I said in my haste</b> to flee from before Absalom.
<b>“All men are liars”</b> Heb. כזב, [meaning that one] betrays his friend, for I saw my son betray me and seek my life, and [I saw] all Israel repay me with evil for good; therefore, I believed Ziba and said that Mephibosheth also lies and betrays me. Every expression of כָּזָב is purely an expression of lack of trust that they trusted in him; falenze in Old French, betrayal, deceit, like (Isa. 58:11): “whose water does not fail (יכזבו).” Others interpret it: <b>I said in my haste</b> at the Rock of the Divisions, when Saul and his men were encircling me and my men, to seize me, and there it says (I Sam. 23:26): “and David was hastening to get away.” <b>“All men are liars”</b> Even the prophet Samuel, who is faithful as a prophet, even he is a deceiver, for he anointed me king.
