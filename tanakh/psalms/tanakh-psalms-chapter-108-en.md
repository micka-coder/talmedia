### passuk 8
God spoke in His holiness, that I would exult; That I would divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.

### passuk 9
Gilead is mine, Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the defence of my head; Judah is my sceptre.

### passuk 10
Moab is my washpot; Upon Edom do I cast my shoe; Over Philistia do I cry aloud.

### passuk 11
Who will bring me into the fortified city? Who will lead me unto Edom?
