For the Leader; Al-tashheth. [A Psalm] of David; Michtam.

### passuk 2
Do ye indeed speak as a righteous company? Do ye judge with equity the sons of men?

### passuk 3
Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; Ye weigh out in the earth the violence of your hands.

### passuk 4
The wicked are estranged from the womb; The speakers of lies go astray as soon as they are born.

### passuk 5
Their venom is like the venom of a serpent; They are like the deaf asp that stoppeth her ear;

### passuk 6
Which hearkeneth not to the voice of charmers, Or of the most cunning binder of spells.

### passuk 7
Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth; Break out the cheek-teeth of the young lions, O LORD.

### passuk 8
Let them melt away as water that runneth apace; When he aimeth his arrows, let them be as though they were cut off.

### passuk 9
Let them be as a snail which melteth and passeth away; Like the untimely births of a woman, that have not seen the sun.

### passuk 10
Before your pots can feel the thorns, He will sweep it away with a whirlwind, the raw and the burning alike.

### passuk 11
The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance; He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.

### passuk 12
And men shall say: 'Verily there is a reward for the righteous; Verily there is a God that judgeth in the earth.'
