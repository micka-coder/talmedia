Maschil of Ethan the Ezrahite.

### passuk 2
I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever; To all generations will I make known Thy faithfulness with my mouth.

### passuk 3
For I have said: 'For ever is mercy built; In the very heavens Thou dost establish Thy faithfulness.

### passuk 4
I have made a covenant with My chosen, I have sworn unto David My servant:

### passuk 5
For ever will I establish thy seed, And build up thy throne to all generations.' Selah

### passuk 6
So shall the heavens praise Thy wonders, O LORD, Thy faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones.

### passuk 7
For who in the skies can be compared unto the LORD, Who among the sons of might can be likened unto the LORD,

### passuk 8
A God dreaded in the great council of the holy ones, And feared of all them that are about Him?

### passuk 9
O LORD God of hosts, Who is a mighty one, like unto Thee, O LORD? And Thy faithfulness is round about Thee.

### passuk 10
Thou rulest the proud swelling of the sea; When the waves thereof arise, Thou stillest them.

### passuk 11
Thou didst crush Rahab, as one that is slain; Thou didst scattered Thine enemies with the arm of Thy strength.

### passuk 12
Thine are the heavens, Thine also the earth; The world and the fulness thereof, Thou hast founded them.

### passuk 13
The north and the south, Thou hast created them; Tabor and Hermon rejoice in Thy name.

### passuk 14
Thine is an arm with might; Strong is Thy hand, and exalted is Thy right hand.

### passuk 15
Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Thy throne; Mercy and truth go before Thee.

### passuk 16
Happy is the people that know the joyful shout; They walk, O LORD, in the light of Thy countenance.

### passuk 17
In Thy name do they rejoice all the day; And through Thy righteousness are they exalted.

### passuk 18
For Thou art the glory of their strength; And in Thy favour our horn is exalted.

### passuk 19
For of the LORD is our shield; And the Holy One of Israel is our king.

### passuk 20
Then Thou spokest in vision to Thy godly ones, And saidst: 'I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.

### passuk 21
I have found David My servant; With My holy oil have I anointed him;

### passuk 22
With whom My hand shall be established; Mine arm also shall strengthen him.

### passuk 23
The enemy shall not exact from him; Nor the son of wickedness afflict him.

### passuk 24
And I will beat to pieces his adversaries before him, And smite them that hate him.

### passuk 25
But My faithfulness and My mercy shall be with him; And through My name shall his horn be exalted.

### passuk 26
I will set his hand also on the sea, And his right hand on the rivers.

### passuk 27
He shall call unto Me: Thou art my Father, My God, and the rock of my salvation. .

### passuk 28
I also will appoint him first-born, The highest of the kings of the earth.

### passuk 29
For ever will I keep for him My mercy, And My covenant shall stand fast with him.

### passuk 30
His seed also will I make to endure for ever, And his throne as the days of heaven.

### passuk 31
If his children forsake My law, And walk not in Mine ordinances; :

### passuk 32
If they profane My statutes, And keep not My commandments;

### passuk 33
Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, And their iniquity with strokes.

### passuk 34
But My mercy will I not break off from him, Nor will I be false to My faithfulness.

### passuk 35
My covenant will I not profane, Nor alter that which is gone out of My lips.

### passuk 36
Once have I sworn by My holiness: Surely I will not be false unto David;

### passuk 37
His seed shall endure for ever, And his throne as the sun before Me.

### passuk 38
It shall be established for ever as the moon; And be stedfast as the witness in sky.' Selah

### passuk 39
But Thou hast cast off and rejected, Thou hast been wroth with Thine anointed.

### passuk 40
Thou hast abhorred the covenant of Thy servant; Thou hast profaned his crown even to the ground.

### passuk 41
Thou hast broken down all his fences; Thou hast brought his strongholds to ruin.

### passuk 42
All that pass by the way spoil him; He is become a taunt to his neighbours.

### passuk 43
Thou hast exalted the right hand of his adversaries; Thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.

### passuk 44
Yea, Thou turnest back the edge of his sword, And hast not made him to stand in the battle.

### passuk 45
Thou hast made his brightness to cease, And cast his throne down to the ground.

### passuk 46
The days of his youth hast Thou shortened; Thou hast covered him with shame. Selah

### passuk 47
How long, O LORD, wilt Thou hide Thyself for ever? How long shall Thy wrath burn like fire?

### passuk 48
O remember how short my time is; For what vanity hast Thou created all the children of men!

### passuk 49
What man is he that liveth and shall not see death, That shall deliver his soul from the power of the grave? Selah

### passuk 50
Where are Thy former mercies, O Lord, Which Thou didst swear unto David in Thy faithfulness?

### passuk 51
Remember, Lord, the taunt of Thy servants; How I do bear in my bosom [the taunt of] so many peoples;

### passuk 52
Wherewith Thine enemies have taunted, O LORD, Wherewith they have taunted the footsteps of Thine anointed.

### passuk 53
Blessed be the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen.
