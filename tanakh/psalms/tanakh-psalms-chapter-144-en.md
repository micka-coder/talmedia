### passuk 1
[A Psalm] of David. Blessed be the LORD my Rock, Who traineth my hands for war, And my fingers for battle;

### passuk 2
My lovingkindness, and my fortress, My high tower, and my deliverer; My shield, and He in whom I take refuge; Who subdueth my people under me.

### passuk 3
LORD, what is man, that Thou takest knowledge of him? Or the son of man, that Thou makest account of him?

### passuk 4
Man is like unto a breath; His days are as a shadow that passeth away.

### passuk 5
O LORD, bow Thy heavens, and come down; Touch the mountains, that they may smoke.

### passuk 6
Cast forth lightning, and scatter them; Send out Thine arrows, and discomfit them.

### passuk 7
Stretch forth Thy hands from on high; Rescue me, and deliver me out of many waters, Out of the hand of strangers;

### passuk 8
Whose mouth speaketh falsehood, And their right hand is a right hand of lying.

### passuk 9
O God, I will sing a new song unto Thee, Upon a psaltery of ten strings will I sing praises unto Thee;

### passuk 10
Who givest salvation unto kings, Who rescuest David Thy servant from the hurtful sword.

### passuk 11
Rescue me, and deliver me out of the hand of strangers, Whose mouth speaketh falsehood, And their right hand is a right hand of lying.

### passuk 12
We whose sons are as plants grown up in their youth; Whose daughters are as corner-pillars carved after the fashion of a palace;

### passuk 13
Whose garners are full, affording all manner of store; Whose sheep increase by thousands and ten thousands in our fields;

### passuk 14
Whose oxen are well laden; With no breach, and no going forth, And no outcry in our broad places;

### passuk 15
Happy is the people that is in such a case. Yea, happy is the people whose God is the LORD.
