### passuk 1
Hallelujah. Sing unto the LORD a new song, And His praise in the assembly of the saints.

### passuk 2
Let Israel rejoice in his Maker; Let the children of Zion be joyful in their King.

### passuk 3
Let them praise His name in the dance; Let them sing praises unto Him with the timbrel and harp.

### passuk 4
For the LORD taketh pleasure in His people; He adorneth the humble with salvation.

### passuk 5
Let the saints exult in glory; Let them sing for joy upon their beds.

### passuk 6
Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, And a two-edged sword in their hand;

### passuk 7
To execute vengeance upon the nations, And chastisements upon the peoples;

### passuk 8
To bind their kings with chains, And their nobles with fetters of iron;

### passuk 9
To execute upon them the judgment written; He is the glory of all His saints. Hallelujah.
