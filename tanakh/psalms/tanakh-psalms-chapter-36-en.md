For the Leader. [A Psalm] of David the servant of the LORD.

### passuk 2
Transgression speaketh to the wicked, methinksâ€” There is no fear of God before his eyes.

### passuk 3
For it flattereth him in his eyes, Until his iniquity be found, and he be hated.

### passuk 4
The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit; He hath left off to be wise, to do good.

### passuk 5
He deviseth iniquity upon his bed; He setteth himself in a way that is not good; He abhorreth not evil.

### passuk 6
Thy lovingkindness, O LORD, is in the heavens; Thy faithfulness reacheth unto the skies.

### passuk 7
Thy righteousness is like the mighty mountains; Thy judgments are like the great deep; Man and beast Thou preservest, O LORD.

### passuk 8
How precious is Thy lovingkindness, O God! And the children of men take refuge in the shadow of Thy wings.

### passuk 9
They are abundantly satisfied with the fatness of Thy house; And Thou makest them drink of the river of Thy pleasures.

### passuk 10
For with Thee is the fountain of life; In Thy light do we see light.

### passuk 11
O continue Thy lovingkindness unto them that know Thee; And Thy righteousness to the upright in heart.

### passuk 12
Let not the foot of pride overtake me, And let not the hand of the wicked drive me away.

### passuk 13
There are the workers of iniquity fallen; They are thrust down, and are not able to rise.
