### passuk 2

### passuk 3
<b>The rivers have raised, O Lord</b> This is an expression of a cry and a plaint: Woe, O Lord, behold! Your enemies, who flood like rivers, have raised their voice and roar, and the lowness of the depths of their locks they will raise and lift on high constantly to be haughty against You. Every expression of דכא is an expression of depth and lowness.

### passuk 4
<b>More than the voices of great waters, etc.</b> I know that more than the voices of great waters, which roar over us, and more than the mightiest breakers of this sea, You are mighty, O Lord, and Your hand is powerful over them.

### passuk 5
<b>Your testimonies</b> which Your prophets prophesied and promised concerning Your house, which is the dwelling of holiness.
<b>are very faithful to Your house</b> and to the length of days He looks forward to them, and although it has been a long time, they are very faithful to God.
<b>dwelling</b> Heb. נאוה, like (83:13): “the dwellings נְאוֹת of God,” an expression of נָוֶה. You should know [that this is so] because no instance of נָאוָה has a pronounced “aleph,” for they are an expression of נוֹי beauty, but this one has an “aleph” which is pronounced.
