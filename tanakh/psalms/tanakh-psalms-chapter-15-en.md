### passuk 1
A Psalm of David. LORD, who shall sojourn in Thy tabernacle? Who shall dwell upon Thy holy mountain?

### passuk 2
He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, And speaketh truth in his heart;

### passuk 3
That hath no slander upon his tongue, Nor doeth evil to his fellow, Nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour;

### passuk 4
In whose eyes a vile person is despised, But he honoureth them that fear the LORD; He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not;

### passuk 5
He that putteth not out his money on interest, Nor taketh a bribe against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.
