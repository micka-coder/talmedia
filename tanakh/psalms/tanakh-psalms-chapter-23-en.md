### passuk 1
A Psalm of David. The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.

### passuk 2
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside the still waters.

### passuk 3
He restoreth my soul; He guideth me in straight paths for His name's sake.

### passuk 4
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me; Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me.

### passuk 5
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies; Thou hast anointed my head with oil; my cup runneth over.

### passuk 6
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life; And I shall dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.
