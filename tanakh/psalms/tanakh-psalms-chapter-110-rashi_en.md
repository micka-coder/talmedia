<b>“Wait for My right hand”</b> Wait for My salvation and hope for the Lord. [The root] ישיבה means only waiting, as Scripture states (Deut. 1:46): “And you stayed (ותשבו) in Kadesh for many days.”

### passuk 3
<b>Your people will volunteer on the day of your host</b> When you gather an army to pursue them, your people and your friends will volunteer to go out with you, as we find (Gen. 14:14): “and he armed his trained men, those born in his house,” and no more; and Aner, Eshkol, and Mamre volunteered by themselves to go out to his aid.
<b>because of the beauty of holiness when you fell from the womb</b> And this will be to you in the merit of the beauty of holiness that was in you from your mother’s womb, for he recognized his Creator at the age of three.
<b>when you fell from the womb</b> Heb. משחר, when you fell from the womb, like (Beizah 35b): “We may let fruit down (משילין) through a skylight on a festival,” and some learn משחירין.
<b>for you, your youth is like dew</b> For you will be considered your youth, the ways of uprightness with which you conducted yourself in your youth will be for you as pleasantness, like this dew, which is pleasant and comforting.

<b>and will not repent</b> over the good that He spoke about you.
<b>you are a priest forever because of the speech of Malchizedek</b> From you will emerge the priesthood and the kingship that your children will inherit from Shem your progenitor, the priesthood and the kingship, which were given to him. דִבְרָתִי מלכי-צדק. The “yud” is superfluous, like (Lam. 1:1): “the city that was once so populous (רבתי).” Because of the speech of Malchizedek, because of the command of Malchizedek. You are a priest, Heb. כהן. The word כהן bears the connotation of priesthood and rulership, as (II Sam. 8:18): “and David’s sons were chief officers.”

### passuk 5
<b>The Lord</b> Who was on your right hand in battle.

He... <b>will execute justice upon the nations [into] a heap of corpses</b> This is the tidings of the ‘covenant between the segments,’ [in] which was stated to him concerning Egypt (Gen. 15:14): “But also that nation whom they will serve do I judge.”

### passuk 6
<b>a heap of corpses</b> Heb. מלא, a heap of corpses. מלא is an expression of gathering, as (Jer. 12:6): “have called a gang (מלא) after you”; (Isa. 31:4), “although a band (מלא) of shepherds gather against him.” Now where did He execute justice, making them a heap of corpses? (Exod. 14:30), “the Egyptians dead on the seashore.”
<b>He crushed the head on a great land</b> This resembles the prophecy of Habakkuk (3:12): “You have crushed the head of the house of the wicked.” [This refers to] the head of Pharaoh, who was the head and the prince of a land greater and more esteemed than all the lands, as is said (above 102:20): “a ruler of peoples [sent] and loosed his bonds,” for all the nations were under the rule of Egypt.

[1] <b>The word of the Lord about my master</b> Concerning my master, Saul, when I was pursued by him.
<b>about my master</b> Heb. לאדני, about my master, as (Exod. 14:3): “Then Pharaoh will say concerning the children of (לבני) Israel”; (Gen. 26:7), “The people of the place asked him about his wife (לאשתו).”
<b>“Wait for My right hand”</b> Stay and wait for My salvation.

<b>above the charge of Malchizedek</b> above the priesthood (Some mss. read: above the charge) of Malchizedek, who was a priest to the Most High God. Now if you challenge that he too was a king, [we answer that] the kingdom over the nations was not an esteemed kingdom when compared to Israel.
[5] <b>The Lord</b> will always be on your right hand to save you, Who...
<b>crushed kings on the day of His wrath</b> Those who fought with Abraham and with Joshua and with Barak.

[7] <b>From the stream on the way</b> he was drinking, for he boasted that his armies drank from the waters of the Jordan, as it is said (Isa. 37:25): “I dug and drank water, and I dry up, etc.”
<b>therefore, he raised his head</b> He praised himself and boasted of his greatness.
