### passuk 1
Hallelujah. Praise the LORD, O my soul.

### passuk 2
I will praise the LORD while I live; I will sing praises unto my God while I have my being.

### passuk 3
Put not your trust in princes, Nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.

### passuk 4
His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his dust; In that very day his thoughts perish.

### passuk 5
Happy is he whose help is the God of Jacob, Whose hope is in the LORD his God,

### passuk 6
Who made heaven and earth, The sea, and all that in them is; Who keepeth truth for ever;

### passuk 7
Who executeth justice for the oppressed; Who giveth bread to the hungry. The LORD looseth the prisoners;

### passuk 8
The LORD openeth the eyes of the blind; The LORD raiseth up them that are bowed down; The LORD loveth the righteous;

### passuk 9
The LORD preserveth the strangers; He upholdeth the fatherless and the widow; But the way of the wicked He maketh crooked.

### passuk 10
The LORD will reign for ever, Thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Hallelujah.
