### passuk 2
Only for God doth my soul wait in stillness; From Him cometh my salvation.

### passuk 3
He only is my rock and my salvation, My high tower, I shall not be greatly moved.

### passuk 4
How long will ye set upon a man, That ye may slay him, all of you, As a leaning wall, a tottering fence?

Only for God wait thou in stillness, my soul; For from Him cometh my hope.

### passuk 7
He only is my rock and my salvation, My high tower, I shall not be moved.

### passuk 8
Upon God resteth my salvation and my glory; The rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.

### passuk 9
Trust in Him at all times, ye people; Pour out your heart before Him; God is a refuge for us. Selah

### passuk 10
Men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie; If they be laid in the balances, they are together lighter than vanity.

Trust not in oppression, And put not vain hope in robbery; If riches increase, set not your heart thereon.

### passuk 12
God hath spoken once, Twice have I heard this: That strength belongeth unto God;

### passuk 13
Also unto Thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy; For Thou renderest to every man according to his work.
