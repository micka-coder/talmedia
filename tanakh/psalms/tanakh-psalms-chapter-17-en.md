### passuk 1
A Prayer of David. Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry; Give ear unto my prayer from lips without deceit.

### passuk 2
Let my judgment come forth from Thy presence; Let Thine eyes behold equity.

### passuk 3
Thou hast tried my heart, Thou hast visited it in the night; Thou hast tested me, and Thou findest not That I had a thought which should not pass my mouth.

### passuk 4
As for the doings of men, by the word of Thy lips I have kept me from the ways of the violent.

### passuk 5
My steps have held fast to Thy paths, My feet have not slipped.

### passuk 6
As for me, I call upon Thee, for Thou wilt answer me, O God; Incline Thine ear unto me, hear my speech.

### passuk 7
Make passing great Thy mercies, O Thou that savest by Thy right hand From assailants them that take refuge in Thee.

### passuk 8
Keep me as the apple of the eye, Hide me in the shadow of Thy wings,

### passuk 9
From the wicked that oppress, My deadly enemies, that compass me about.

### passuk 10
Their gross heart they have shut tight, With their mouth they speak proudly.

### passuk 11
At our every step they have now encompassed us; They set their eyes to cast us down to the earth.

### passuk 12
He is like a lion that is eager to tear in pieces, And like a young lion lurking in secret places.

### passuk 13
Arise, O LORD, confront him, cast him down; Deliver my soul from the wicked, by Thy sword;

### passuk 14
From men, by Thy hand, O LORD, From men of the world, whose portion is in this life, And whose belly Thou fillest with Thy treasure; Who have children in plenty, And leave their abundance to their babes.

### passuk 15
As for me, I shall behold Thy face in righteousness; I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with Thy likeness.
