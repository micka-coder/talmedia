### passuk 1
A Song of Ascents. Happy is every one that feareth the LORD, That walketh in His ways.

### passuk 2
When thou eatest the labour of thy hands, Happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee.

### passuk 3
Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine, in the innermost parts of thy house; Thy children like olive plants, round about thy table.

### passuk 4
Behold, surely thus shall the man be blessed That feareth the LORD.

### passuk 5
The LORD bless thee out of Zion; And see thou the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life;

### passuk 6
And see thy children's children. Peace be upon Israel!
