### passuk 1
A Psalm of Asaph. Surely God is good to Israel, even to such as are pure in heart.

### passuk 2
But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.

### passuk 3
For I was envious at the arrogant, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.

### passuk 4
For there are no pangs at their death, and their body is sound.

### passuk 5
In the trouble of man they are not; neither are they plagued like men.

### passuk 6
Therefore pride is as a chain about their neck; violence covereth them as a garment.

### passuk 7
Their eyes stand forth from fatness; they are gone beyond the imaginations of their heart.

### passuk 8
They scoff, and in wickedness utter oppression; they speak as if there were none on high.

### passuk 9
They have set their mouth against the heavens, And their tongue walketh through the earth.

### passuk 10
Therefore His people return hither; And waters of fullness are drained out by them.

### passuk 11
And they say: 'How doth God know? And is there knowledge in the Most High?'

### passuk 12
Behold, such are the wicked; And they that are always at ease increase riches.

### passuk 13
Surely in vain have I cleansed my heart, And washed my hands in innocency;

### passuk 14
For all the day have I been plagued, And my chastisement came every morning.

### passuk 15
If I had said: 'I will speak thus', Behold, I had been faithless to the generation of Thy children.

### passuk 16
And when I pondered how I might know this, It was wearisome in mine eyes;

### passuk 17
Until I entered into the sanctuary of God, And considered their end.

### passuk 18
Surely Thou settest them in slippery places; Thou hurlest them down to utter ruin.

### passuk 19
How are they become a desolation in a moment! They are wholly consumed by terrors.

### passuk 20
As a dream when one awaketh, So, O Lord, when Thou arousest Thyself, Thou wilt despise their semblance.

### passuk 21
For my heart was in a ferment, And I was pricked in my reins. .

### passuk 22
But I was brutish, and ignorant; I was as a beast before Thee.

### passuk 23
Nevertheless I am continually with Thee; Thou holdest my right hand.

### passuk 24
Thou wilt guide me with Thy counsel, And afterward receive me with glory.

### passuk 25
Whom have I in heaven but Thee? And beside Thee I desire none upon earth.

### passuk 26
My flesh and my heart faileth; But God is the rock of my heart and my portion for ever.

### passuk 27
For, lo, they that go far from Thee shall perish; Thou dost destroy all them that go astray from Thee.

### passuk 28
But as for me, the nearness of God is my good; I have made the Lord GOD my refuge, That I may tell of all Thy works.
