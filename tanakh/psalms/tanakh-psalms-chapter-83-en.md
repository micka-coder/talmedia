### passuk 1
A Song, a Psalm of Asaph.

### passuk 2
O God, keep not Thou silence; Hold not Thy peace, and be not still, O God.

### passuk 3
For, lo, Thine enemies are in an uproar; And they that hate Thee have lifted up the head.

### passuk 4
They hold crafty converse against Thy people, And take counsel against Thy treasured ones.

### passuk 5
They have said: 'Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; That the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.'

### passuk 6
For they have consulted together with one consent; Against Thee do they make a covenant;

### passuk 7
The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab, and the Hagrites;

### passuk 8
Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;

### passuk 9
Assyria also is joined with them; They have been an arm to the children of Lot. Selah

### passuk 10
Do Thou unto them as unto Midian; As to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook Kishon;

### passuk 11
Who were destroyed at En-dor; They became as dung for the earth.

### passuk 12
Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, And like Zebah and Zalmunna all their princes;

### passuk 13
Who said: 'Let us take to ourselves in possession The habitations of God.'

### passuk 14
O my God, make them like the whirling dust; As stubble before the wind.

### passuk 15
As the fire that burneth the forest, And as the flame that setteth the mountains ablaze;

### passuk 16
So pursue them with Thy tempest, And affright them with Thy storm.

### passuk 17
Fill their faces with shame; That they may seek Thy name, O LORD.

### passuk 18
Let them be ashamed and affrighted for ever; Yea, let them be abashed and perish;

### passuk 19
That they may know that it is Thou alone whose name is the LORD, The Most High over all the earth.
