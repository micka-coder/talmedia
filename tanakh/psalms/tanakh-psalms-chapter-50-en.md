### passuk 1
A Psalm of Asaph. God, God, the LORD, hath spoken, and called the earth From the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.

### passuk 2
Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined forth.

### passuk 3
Our God cometh, and doth not keep silence; a fire devoureth before Him, And round about Him it stormeth mightily.

### passuk 4
He calleth to the heavens above, and to the earth, that He may judge His people:

### passuk 5
'Gather My saints together unto Me; those that have made a covenant with Me by sacrifice.'

### passuk 6
And the heavens declare His righteousness; for God, He is judge. Selah

### passuk 7
'Hear, O My people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee: God, thy God, am I.

### passuk 8
I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices; and thy burnt-offerings are continually before Me.

### passuk 9
I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he-goats out of thy folds.

### passuk 10
For every beast of the forest is Mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills.

### passuk 11
I know all the fowls of the mountains; and the wild beasts of the field are Mine.

### passuk 12
If I were hungry, I would not tell thee; for the world is Mine, and the fulness thereof.

### passuk 13
Do I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?

### passuk 14
Offer unto God the sacrifice of thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the Most High;

### passuk 15
And call upon Me in the day of trouble; I will deliver thee, and thou shalt honour Me.'

### passuk 16
But unto the wicked God saith: 'What hast thou to do to declare My statutes, And that thou hast taken My covenant in thy mouth?

### passuk 17
Seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest My words behind thee.

### passuk 18
When thou sawest a thief, thou hadst company with him, and with adulterers was thy portion.

### passuk 19
Thou hast let loose thy mouth for evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit. .

### passuk 20
Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; Thou slanderest thine own mother's son.

### passuk 21
These things hast thou done, and should I have kept silence? Thou hadst thought that I was altogether such a one as thyself; but I will reprove thee, and set the cause before thine eyes.

### passuk 22
Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear in pieces, and there be none to deliver.

### passuk 23
Whoso offereth the sacrifice of thanksgiving honoureth Me; and to him that ordereth his way aright Will I show the salvation of God.'
