### passuk 1
[A Psalm] of David. Judge me, O LORD, for I have walked in mine integrity, and I have trusted in the LORD without wavering.

### passuk 2
Examine me, O LORD, and try me; test my reins and my heart.

### passuk 3
For Thy mercy is before mine eyes; and I have walked in Thy truth.

### passuk 4
I have not sat with men of falsehood; neither will I go in with dissemblers.

### passuk 5
I hate the gathering of evil doers, and will not sit with the wicked.

### passuk 6
I will wash my hands in innocency; so will I compass Thine altar, O LORD,

### passuk 7
That I may make the voice of thanksgiving to be heard, and tell of all Thy wondrous works.

### passuk 8
LORD, I love the habitation of Thy house, and the place where Thy glory dwelleth.

### passuk 9
Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with men of blood;

### passuk 10
In whose hands is craftiness, and their right hand is full of bribes.

### passuk 11
But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity; Redeem me, and be gracious unto me.

### passuk 12
My foot standeth in an even place; in the congregations will I bless the LORD.
