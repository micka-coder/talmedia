### passuk 1
A Song of Ascents; of Solomon. Except the LORD build the house, They labour in vain that build it; Except the LORD keep the city, The watchman waketh but in vain.

### passuk 2
It is vain for you that ye rise early, and sit up late, Ye that eat the bread of toil; So He giveth unto His beloved in sleep.

### passuk 3
Lo, children are a heritage of the LORD; The fruit of the womb is a reward.

### passuk 4
As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, So are the children of one's youth.

### passuk 5
Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them; They shall not be put to shame, When they speak with their enemies in the gate.
