For the Leader; upon Muthlabben. A Psalm of David.

### passuk 2
I will give thanks unto the LORD with my whole heart; I will tell of all Thy marvellous works.

### passuk 3
I will be glad and exult in Thee; I will sing praise to Thy name, O Most High:

### passuk 4
When mine enemies are turned back, They stumble and perish at Thy presence;

### passuk 5
For Thou hast maintained my right and my cause; Thou sattest upon the throne as the righteous Judge.

### passuk 6
Thou hast rebuked the nations, Thou hast destroyed the wicked, Thou hast blotted out their name for ever and ever.

### passuk 7
O thou enemy, the waste places are come to an end for ever; And the cities which thou didst uproot, Their very memorial is perished.

### passuk 8
But the LORD is enthroned for ever; He hath established His throne for judgment.

### passuk 9
And He will judge the world in righteousness, He will minister judgment to the peoples with equity.

### passuk 10
The LORD also will be a high tower for the oppressed, A high tower in times of trouble;

### passuk 11
And they that know Thy name will put their trust in Thee; For thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek Thee.

### passuk 12
Sing praises to the LORD, who dwelleth in Zion; Declare among the peoples His doings.

### passuk 13
For He that avengeth blood hath remembered them; He hath not forgotten the cry of the humble.

### passuk 14
Be gracious unto me, O LORD, Behold mine affliction at the hands of them that hate me; Thou that liftest me up from the gates of death;

### passuk 15
That I may tell of all Thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion, That I may rejoice in Thy salvation.

### passuk 16
The nations are sunk down in the pit that they made; In the net which they hid is their own foot taken.

### passuk 17
The LORD hath made Himself known, He hath executed judgment, The wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah

### passuk 18
The wicked shall return to the nether-world, Even all the nations that forget God.

### passuk 19
For the needy shall not alway be forgotten, Nor the expectation of the poor perish for ever.

### passuk 20
Arise, O LORD, let not man prevail; Let the nations be judged in Thy sight.

### passuk 21
Set terror over them, O LORD; Let the nations know they are but men. Selah
