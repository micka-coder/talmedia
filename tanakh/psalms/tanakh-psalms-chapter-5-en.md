For the Leader; upon the Nehiloth. A Psalm of David.

### passuk 2
Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.

### passuk 3
Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God; For unto Thee do I pray.

### passuk 4
O LORD, in the morning shalt Thou hear my voice; In the morning will I order my prayer unto Thee, and will look forward.

### passuk 5
For Thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness; Evil shall not sojourn with Thee.

### passuk 6
The boasters shall not stand in Thy sight; Thou hatest all workers of iniquity.

### passuk 7
Thou destroyest them that speak falsehood; The LORD abhorreth the man of blood and of deceit.

### passuk 8
But as for me, in the abundance of Thy lovingkindness will I come into Thy house; I will bow down toward Thy holy temple in the fear of Thee.

### passuk 9
O LORD, lead me in Thy righteousness because of them that lie in wait for me; Make Thy way straight before my face.

### passuk 10
For there is no sincerity in their mouth; Their inward part is a yawning gulf, Their throat is an open sepulchre; They make smooth their tongue.

### passuk 11
Hold them guilty, O God, Let them fall by their own counsels; Cast them down in the multitude of their transgressions; For they have rebelled against Thee.

### passuk 12
So shall all those that take refuge in Thee rejoice, They shall ever shout for joy, And Thou shalt shelter them; Let them also that love Thy name exult in Thee.

### passuk 13
For Thou dost bless the righteous; O LORD, Thou dost encompass him with favour as with a shield.
