### passuk 1
<b>a sharp sword</b> symbolizing the sword of Nebuchadnezzar.
<b>a cobbler’s razor</b> Heb. הַגַלָבִים, the cobblers. It is Greek, and some say that it is parcheminer in Old French, cobbler, saddler. However, Menachem (p. 56) defines תַעַר הַגַלָבִים as, the barber’s razor. No similar word exists in Scripture.

### passuk 2
<b>in the midst of the city</b> that you inscribed on the brick, as the completion of the days of the siege. This is a sign that a third of them will perish in the heat of hunger in its midst, which is like fire, in the same way that it says (Lam. 5:10): “Our skin is parched as by a furnace because of the heat of hunger.”
<b>and strike</b> it.
<b>with a sword all around it</b> Around that brick, symbolizing those who flee from the city, whom the Chaldeans will overtake and slay in the environs of Jerusalem.
<b>and a third you shall scatter to the wind</b> symbolizing the exiles who will go to Egypt, viz. Johanan son of Kareach and his associates, and there I shall unsheathe a sword [in pursuit] after them, for Nebuchadnezzar went and destroyed Egypt, and there they were slain.

### passuk 3
<b>and you shall bind them in your skirts</b> These are the few people who will be exiled to Babylon and will live. An addendum to Rashi reads: <b>and you shall bind them</b> From here is an allusion [to the fact] that whoever cuts his hair should not cast it away, but should hide it, for any act written in these verses has implications of evil.

### passuk 4
<b>And you shall take more of them</b> From those few people.
<b>and burn them with fire</b> This represents Ahab son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah son of Maaseiah, whom the king of Babylon burnt with fire (Jer.29: 21f.).
<b>therefrom a fire will emerge</b> From these allusions that I give you, retribution will emerge to all the house of Israel.

### passuk 5
<b>among the nations I have placed it</b> In the middle of the world.

### passuk 6
<b>But she exchanged My judgments</b> Heb. וַתֶּמֶר, she exchanged My judgments.
<b>more than the nations</b> For so it is written concerning Manasseh (II Chron. 33:9): “And Manasseh misled Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to do evil more than the nations that the Lord had destroyed from before the children of Israel.” Some interpret this to mean that the nations did not accept His Torah, but they [Israel] did accept it upon themselves, and transgressed it.

### passuk 7
<b>Because you have prepared yourselves</b> Because you have prepared yourselves to be more profligate than the nations.
[The word] הֲמָנְכֶם is an expression of (Dan 1:5): “And the king allotted (וַיְמַן) [food] for them.” Menachem, though, interpreted it as an expression of stirring, like (Ps. 46: 7): “Nations have stirred (הָמוּ).”
<b>and like the customs of the nations that were around you, you did not do</b> For they did not exchange their gods, although they are not gods, but you exchanged My glory for something that avails not. Our Sages (Sanh. 39b) explained: You did not do as the virtuous ones among them, you did as the corrupt ones among them.

### passuk 8
<b>I too</b> You betrayed Me, and I too, behold I am upon you.

<b>and I shall cause My fury against them to subside</b> When I avenge Myself against them, My fury will subside, and My spirit will not oppress Me.
<b>and I shall be comforted</b> Heb. וְהִנֶחָמְתִּי. And I shall be comforted from the pain that you inflicted upon Me.

### passuk 14
<b>a ruin</b> Heb. לְחָרְבָּה, destroyer in Old French, to make desolate, destroy.

### passuk 15
<b>and a taunt</b> A disgrace.
