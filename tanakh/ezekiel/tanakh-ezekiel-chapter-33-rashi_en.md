<b>and He opened my mouth</b> as He says in the beginning of the Book (3:26): “and you shall become mute, and you shall not be a reprover to them.” Afterward, He said to him (24:25ff.): “on the day I take from them their strength, etc., the fugitive will come to you, etc., on that day, your mouth will be opened with the fugitive, and you will speak and no longer be mute.”

### passuk 24
<b>Abraham was one</b> This is one of four things that Rabbi Akiva interpreted [in one way] and which his disciple, Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai, did not interpret as he did. Rabbi Shimon interpreted it in this manner: Abraham, who was commanded with only one commandment [namely circumcision], inherited the land. We, then, who have been commanded with many commandments, should surely have the land given to us for an inheritance (Tosefta Sotah 6:7). This is what the prophet answers them.

### passuk 25
<b>You eat on the blood, etc., and you should inherit the land</b> This is a rhetorical question. If you were commanded [many commandments], you do not keep [them]. You eat on the blood: you eat delicacies through murder, for you slay those who have money and take away their money.

<b>And when it comes</b> the evil to them.
<b>behold it is coming</b> for, indeed, it is ready to come; then they will know that your words were not a jest, but that a true prophet was in their midst.
