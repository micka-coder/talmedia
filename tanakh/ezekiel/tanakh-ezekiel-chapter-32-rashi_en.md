### passuk 2
<b>You resembled a young lion among the nations, but you are like a crocodile in the seas</b> You should have lain in the midst of your rivers, as is the custom of the fish, and not gone out to the dry land; but you were haughty in your heart, and you compared yourself to a young lion, which dominates the dry land and goes forth to tear prey.
<b>and you went out with your rivers</b> [Heb. וַתָּגַח,] and you went out with your rivers, the same meaning as in (Ps. 22:10): “You drew me (גֹחִי) from the womb”; (Job 40:23), “he will draw (יָגִיחַ) the Jordan into his mouth”; Jud. 20:33), “And the liers in wait of Israel drew forth (מֵגִיחַ).” [This is] an expression for something flowing and going out of a hidden place.
<b>and you sullied</b> [Heb. וַתִּדְלַח,] an expression of making something murky.
<b>with your feet</b> You had no feet, but I made for you feet like the beasts of the earth, to cross the waters of the lands and to tread their rivers. The symbolism is like Targum Jonathan: and you waged war with your camps and you caused the peoples to quake with your supporters, and you destroyed their countries.

### passuk 3
<b>with My net</b> [Heb. בְּחֶרְמִי,] a word for a net, and there are many in Scriptures, [e.g.,] (Hab. 1: 15): “he catches them in his net (בְּחֶרְמוֹ)”; (Ecc. 7:26), “snares and nets (וַחֲרָמִים).”

### passuk 4

### passuk 5
<b>and I shall fill the valleys with what is cast off from you</b> [Heb. רָמוּתֶךָ] your casting, like (Exod. 15: 1): “He cast (רָמָה) into the sea.” Others say that רָמוּתֶךָ is meant as a form of the word for worm (רִמָה), like (ibid. 16:20): “and it became alive with worms (וַיָרֻם).”

### passuk 6
<b>And I shall water...the land where you float</b> [Heb. צָפָתְךָ,] the land where you float on the surface of the water of your rivers-like (Lam. 3:54): “Water floated (צָפוּ) over my head”; (II Kings 6:6): “and the axe blade floated (וַיָצֶף)” - that land I will water with your blood.
<b>even to the mountains</b> the highest [mountains] in it. צָפָתְךָ is ton flottement in French, your floating, swimming.
<b>and the streams</b> [Heb. וַאֲפִיקִים,] riveyes in Old French, gullies, gulches; streams.

### passuk 7
<b>And with your smoke I will cover the heavens</b> [Heb. בְּכַבּוֹתְךָ, lit. with you extinguishing.] When your conflagration will be extinguished, the smoke will rise and cover the sky and darken the luminaries; i.e., all who hear the news of what happened to you will mourn and be astonished, because everyone will worry about himself, saying, “The destroyer will stand up over us as well.”

### passuk 8

<b>And I will cause...to be appalled</b> [Heb. וַהֲשִּׁוֹתִי,] an expression of bewilderment.
<b>when I cause My sword to fly before their faces</b> [Heb. בְּעוֹפְפִי,] an expression of a flying bird, when I send upon you the army of My emissaries through their land.
<b>and they will quake at their ruin</b> [Heb. לִרְגָעִים,] to ruins, lest ruin come upon them as well. Another explanation: an expression of an actual moment (רֶגַע). In this sense, Menachem (p. 162) connects it.
<b>everyone for himself</b> each one concerning himself, soi- meme in French, for himself.

<b>shall speak of him</b> [Heb. יְדַבְּרוּ לוֹ] shall speak of him and of his helpers.
<b>the strongest of the mighty men...from the midst of the Grave</b> Transpose the verse and interpret it: They shall speak of him אֶתעֹזרָיו, with his helpers; i.e., concerning all his helpers with him, too, shall the strongest of the mighty men, who are in the Grave, speak, and they will say about them thus: <b>the uncircumcised... descended, etc.</b> Every לָהֶם, לִי, לוֹ, and לְךָ written next to דִבּוּר, speech, means nothing but “about.”

### passuk 22

<b>and their iniquities were upon their bones</b> Nothing was lacking from their iniquity, for the slaying sword did not expiate it, because they were not slain. Now what is the iniquity? That the destruction wrought by these mighty men was in the land of the living.

### passuk 28
<b>And you - in the midst of the uncircumcised</b> He is addressing Pharaoh.
<b>with those slain by the sword</b> and not with those who die a natural death.
