<b>what will become of the vine tree out of all [other] trees</b> How will its end be different from that of all other trees?
<b>the branch that was among the trees of the forest</b> Not about the vine of the vineyards, which produces fruit, am I asking you, but about the branch of a vine that grows in the forest.

### passuk 3
<b>Will...be taken from it, etc.</b> It is not for that.
<b>any utensil</b> Heb. כל כלי.

### passuk 4
<b>Behold, [if] it were given to the fire to be consumed</b> Adevorer in Old French, to be devoured, consumed. Behold I asked you about a whole one, which is not fit for anything. Now I shall add more to the question: Behold if they put a branch of it into the fire, and the fire consumed it at its two ends of its outer surface until its inside became charred...
<b>were charred</b> Heb. נָחָר, blackened from the fire, brouir in French, to blacken, to scorch. נָחָר derives from the same form found in (Job 30:30): “and my bones dried out (חָרָה) from the heat.” Some translate this as e(s)sart in Old French, calcined, burnt to ashes, as [its sense] in Hosea (8:5) and also in (Job 19:11): “He has kindled (וַיַחַר) His wrath against me.” Menachem (p. 93) [however] related it to “my bones dried out.” <b>is it fit</b> [Is it] still fit for work?

### passuk 6
<b>have I placed</b> Jerusalem. Its two ends were consumed by the fire, [i.e.,] the two exiles: When Jehoiakim was exiled, some of the royal seed and of the nobles were exile with him, as it is said in Daniel (1:3). After him were exiled his son Jeconiah and the craftsmen and the gate sentries. “And its inside was charred” [based on above, verse 4] Concerning Zedekiah, the one who remained therein, I have already decreed (10:2): “and fill your hands with fiery coals...and cast [them] onto the city.”

### passuk 7
<b>From the fire they have emerged</b> They transgressed the words of the Torah, which were given from fire, and nations as strong as fire will destroy them.
