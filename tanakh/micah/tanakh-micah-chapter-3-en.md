### passuk 1
And I said: Hear, I pray you, ye heads of Jacob, and rulers of the house of Israel: Is it not for you to know justice?

### passuk 2
Who hate the good, and love the evil; who rob their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;

### passuk 3
Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them, and break their bones; yea, they chop them in pieces, as that which is in the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.

### passuk 4
Then shall they cry unto the LORD, But He will not answer them; yea, He will hide His face from them at that time, According as they have wrought evil in their doings.

### passuk 5
Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my people to err; that cry: ‘Peace’, when their teeth have any thing to bite; and whoso putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him:

### passuk 6
Therefore it shall be night unto you, that ye shall have no vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down upon the prophets, and the day shall be black over them.

### passuk 7
And the seers shall be put to shame, and the diviners confounded; yea, they shall all cover their upper lips; for there shall be no answer of God.

### passuk 8
But I truly am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of justice, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.

### passuk 9
Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and rulers of the house of Israel, that abhor justice, and pervert all equity;

### passuk 10
That build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.

### passuk 11
The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money; yet will they lean upon the LORD, and say: ‘Is not the LORD in the midst of us? No evil shall come upon us’?

### passuk 12
Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.
