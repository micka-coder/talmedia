### passuk 1
<b>Woe is to me</b>—The prophet laments over himself, “Woe is to me that I was appointed a prophet at this time, when there are no righteous people in the generation.” 
<b>as the last of the figs</b> Heb. כְּאָסְפֵּי. This is vowelized with a “chataf kamatz” because it is not a verb in the present tense, like:, יוֹשֵב, sits, and אוֹמֵר, says; rather, it is a gerund, as in (<a class="refLink" href="/Isaiah.33.4" data-ref="Isaiah 33:4">Isa. 33:4</a>): “The gathering of (אֹסֶף) the locusts”; like the gathering of קַיִץ. These are the last figs, which are inferior. And so did <i>Jonathan</i> render: as the late figs of the summer. 
<b>as the gleanings of the vintage</b>—As the gleanings after the vintage. [from <i>Jonathan</i>] 
<b>there is no cluster to eat</b>—As the <i>Targum</i> renders: There is no man who has good deeds.

<b>[in return] for the evil of their hands, do they expect that He will benefit them?</b>—Do you expect that He will benefit you as the reward for the evil of your hands? 
<b>the prince asks</b>—for a bribe. 
<b>and the judge</b>—who judges the case is also in the payment. When he is a robber and is liable according to law, he says to his fellow judge, “Do me a favor in this case, and I will vindicate you in another case.” 
<b>and the great man speaks what is in his heart</b>—The king or the prince states in the case what his heart desires. <b>what is in his heart</b> Heb. הַוַּת נַפְשׁוֹ. He speaks what is (הוֶֹה) to his will and to his desire. Cf.(<a class="refLink" href="/Jeremiah.15.1" data-ref="Jeremiah 15:1">Jer. 15:1</a>) “I have no desire for this people.” And so did <i>Jonathan</i> render: The desires of his heart. 
<b>and they weave the web</b>—They made it into a rope of sin amongst the three of them. As the cart ropes, so is the sin, for a rope is braided of three strands. So have I found in the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Taanith</i> 2:1): We made it like a web of sins. 

### passuk 4
<b>The best of them is like a brier</b>—The best among them - it is as hard to extricate oneself from his hand as from a brier (<i>Targum Jonathan</i>). It is as hard to extricate oneself from their hand as [it is to extricate] the briers that are entangled in wool. 
<b>the most upright, [worse] than a thorn hedge</b>—The most upright among them is worse than a thorn hedge. <b>than a thorn hedge</b> Heb. מִמְּסוּכָה. Cf. (<a class="refLink" href="/Isaiah.5.5" data-ref="Isaiah 5:5">Isa. 5: 5</a>) “Remove its hedge (מְשׂוּכָּתוֹ).” 
<b>the day to which you look forward</b>—On the day to which you look forward for good, your visitation shall come. 
<b>their perplexity</b> Heb. מְבוּכָתָם. [<i>Jonathan</i> renders:] עֲרָבוּלָהוֹן. Cf. (<a class="refLink" href="/Exodus.14.3" data-ref="Exodus 14:3">Ex. 14:3</a>) “They are entangled (נְבֻכִים).” Their confusion. 

### passuk 5
<b>Believe not a friend</b> [This is to be understood] according to its apparent meaning. But our Sages explained it as referring to the Most High. Do not sin and say that the Holy One, blessed be He, is our Friend, and He will forgive us. [from <i>Hagiga</i> 16a] 
<b>from her who lies in your bosom</b>—Your soul will testify against you. 
<b>the openings of your mouth</b> Heb. פִּתְחֵי. The words of your mouth, the openings of your mouth. 

### passuk 7
<b>But I will hope in the Lord</b>—The prophet is saying so. 

### passuk 8

### passuk 11
<b>“The day to build your walls”</b>—This refers back to “who says to me”: And she further says to me, “The day to build your walls, which you anticipate - that day...” <b>“its time is way off”</b> Heb. יִרְחַק-חֹק. Its time will be extended, and it will never come. 

### passuk 12
<b>It is a day, and he shall come up to you</b>—The prophet says: That day that you deride, saying that it has been nullified and gone away - that day is guarded and preserved, and has not become nullified. The enemy shall come up to you to destroy you. 
<b>from Assyria</b>—which is the first of those who harmed us. 
<b>and the fortified cities</b>—I.e., and until the fortified cities. And <i>Jonathan</i> renders (as follows): the great dark mountains. 
<b>and the sea from the west</b>—And those dwelling near the Mediterranean Sea, which is in the west. 
<b>and the dwellers of the mountain</b> Heb. וְהַר הָהָר, like יושְׁבֵי הָהָר. But <i>Jonathan</i> did not translate in that manner. 
<b>[11] The day to build your walls</b>—The prophet informs Israel that there is a day preserved and prepared [for them] to build the walls of their ruins. <b>on that day the decree shall distance itself</b>—And the statute of the decrees of the nations shall be nullified from upon you. 
<b>[12] It is a day, and shall come up to you</b>—At that time, the exiles of Israel shall be gathered in from Assyria. 

### passuk 13
<b>And the land shall become</b>—The land of the nations. 

### passuk 14
<b>who dwell alone</b>—That they should dwell alone, in security. 
<b>a forest in the midst of a fruitful field</b>—<i>Jonathan</i> renders: Those who were desolate in a forest shall settle in the “karmel”; those who were desolate in the forests shall dwell alone in the midst of the “karmel,” which is a settled place. It is also possible to explain: <b>who dwell alone</b>—In the forests will not fear the wild beasts as [they would not] in the midst of a fruitful field. 

### passuk 17
<b>as those who crawl on the earth</b>—They are snakes, which crawl on their bellies on the dust of the earth. 
<b>They shall quake from their imprisonment</b>—They shall quake because of the extreme narrowness of their imprisonment and the confinement of their captivity. 

### passuk 20
<b>You shall give the truth of Jacob</b>—<i>Jonathan</i> paraphrases: You shall give the truth of Jacob to his sons, as You swore to him in Bethel; the loving-kindness of Abraham to his seed after him, as you swore to him ‘between the parts.’ You shall remember for us the binding of Isaac, etc. Give us the truth that You promised Jacob. Cause to come true Your word that You promised Jacob (<a class="refLink" href="/Genesis.28.15" data-ref="Genesis 28:15">Gen. 28: 15</a>): “For I will not forsake you.” 
<b>the loving-kindness of Abraham</b> The reward for the loving- kindness of Abraham, [out of] which he commanded his sons to keep the way of the Lord: to perform righteousness and justice. Therefore, it does not say, “And the loving-kindness,” but “the loving- kindness.” The truth - that you will make come true the promise to Jacob - that will be the payment of the reward for Abraham’s loving-kindness. 
<b>which you swore</b>—at the binding of Isaac, (<a class="refLink" href="/Genesis.22.16" data-ref="Genesis 22:16">Gen 22:16</a>) “I swore by Myself, says the Lord, that because you did this thing, etc.”
