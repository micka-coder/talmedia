<b>The heavens are My throne</b> I do not need your Temple.
<b>which is the house</b> that is fitting for My Shechinah.

### passuk 2
<b>And all these</b> The heavens and the earth, and for this reason I confined My Shechinah among you when you obeyed Me, for so is My wont, to look at one poor and of crushed spirit, who hastens to do My bidding. But now, I have no desire for you, for whoever slaughters an ox, has smitten its owner and robbed him of it. Therefore, whoever slaughters a lamb seems to Me as one who beheads a dog, and whoever offers up a meal offering is before Me like swine blood, and מַזְכִּיר, he who burns incense. Comp. (Lev. 5:12) “its memorial part (אַזְכָּרָתָהּ).” Also (ibid. 24:7), “and it shall be for the bread as a memorial (לְאַזְכָּרָה).”

### passuk 3
<b>brings a gift of violence</b> Heb. מְבָרֵךְ, blesses Me with a gift of violence, brings a gift of violence. This is its explanation, and the expression of בְּרָכָה applies to a gift that is for a reception. Comp. (Gen. 33: 11) “Please take my gift (בִּרְכָתִי).” Also (supra 36:16), “Make peace (בְרָכָה) with me and come out to me.”
<b>they, too, chose their ways</b> They desire these evil ways, and I, too, will choose and desire their mockeries. Now if you ask the meaning of גַּם, too, so is the style of the Hebrew language to say twice גַּם one next to the other. Comp. (Deut. 32:25) “Both a young man and a virgin (גַּם בָּחוּר גַּם בְּתוּלָה)”; (I Kings 3:26) “neither mine nor yours (גַּם לִי גַּם לָךְ)”; (Ecc. 9:1) “neither love nor hate (גַּם אַהֲבָה גַּם שִׂנְאָה)”; (Num. 18:3) “and neither they nor you shall die (גַּם הֵם גַּם אַתֶּם).” Here, too, both they chose and I will choose.

### passuk 4
<b>their mockeries</b> Heb. בְּתַעֲלוּלֵיהֶם, to mock them, an expression like (ibid. 22:29) “For you mocked (הִתְעַלַּלְתְּ) me.”
<b>and their fears</b> What they fear.
<b>since I called</b> Hearken and return to Me.
<b>and no one answered</b> saying, “I heard.”

### passuk 5
<b>who quake at His word</b> The righteous who hasten with quaking to draw near to His words.
<b>Your brethren...said</b> The transgressors of Israel mentioned above. Another explanation: <b>Your brethren... who cast you out, said</b> Who said to you (Lam. 4:15), “Turn away, unclean one.”
<b>who hate you, who cast you out</b> Who say (supra 65:5), “Keep to yourself, do not come near me.” [Because of the confusion, we quote other readings. Some manuscripts, as well as K’li Paz, read:] <b>Your brethren... said</b> The transgressors of Israel mentioned above. <b>who hate you, who cast you out</b> who say (supra 65: 5), “Keep to yourself, do not come near me.” Another explanation: <b>Your brethren...said</b> The children of Esau. <b>who cast you out</b> Who said to you (Lam. 4:15), “Turn away, unclean one.” <b>For the sake of my name, the Lord shall be glorified</b> With our greatness, the Holy One, blessed be He, is glorified, for we are closer to Him than you are.
<b>but we will see your joy</b> The prophet says, But it is not so as their words, for “we will see your joy, and they shall be ashamed.” Why? For sound a sound of their stirring has come before the Holy One, blessed be He, from what they did in His city, and a sound emanates from His Temple and accuses those who destroyed it, and then the voice of the Lord, recompensing His enemies.

### passuk 6

### passuk 7
<b>When she has not yet travailed</b> When Zion has not yet travailed with birth pangs, she has borne her children; that is to say that her children will gather into her midst, which was desolate and bereft of them, and it is as though she bore them now without birth pangs, for all the nations will bring them into her midst.
<b>she has been delivered of a male child</b> Heb. וְהִמְלִיטָה. Any emerging of an embedded thing is called הַמְלָטָה. And הַמְלָטָה is esmoucer, or eschamocier in O.F., to allow to escape.

### passuk 8
<b>Is a land born in one day?</b> Can a pain come to a woman in confinement to bear a land full of sons in one day?

### passuk 9
<b>Will I bring to the birth stool and not cause to give birth</b> Will I bring a woman to the birth stool and not open her womb to bring out her fetus? That is to say, Shall I commence a thing and not be able to complete it? Am I not the One Who causes every woman in confinement to give birth, and now will I shut the womb? This is a question.

### passuk 10

### passuk 11
<b>from the breast</b> Heb. מִשֹּׁד, an expression of breasts (שָׁדַיִם).
<b>you drink deeply</b> Heb. תָּמֹצּוּ, sucer in French, to suck.
<b>from her approaching glory</b> Heb. מִזִּיז. From the great glory that is moving and coming nearer to her. 
זִיז means esmoviment in O.F., movement.

### passuk 12
<b>and like a flooding stream</b> I extend to her the wealth of the nations.
<b>on the side</b> On the sides of your nurses, [in Aramaic,] גִּסְסִין.
<b>you shall be dandled</b> You shall be dandled as they dandle an infant. Esbanier in O.F.

### passuk 13

<b>and the hand of the Lord shall be known</b> When He wreaks His vengeance and His awesome acts, His servants shall know the strength of the might of His hand.

### passuk 15
<b>shall come with fire</b> With the fury of fire He shall come upon the wicked.
<b>to render</b> Heb. לְהָשִׁיב, [lit. to return] to His adversaries with fury His anger.

### passuk 16
<b>For with fire</b> of Gehinnom will the Lord contend with His adversaries, and since He is the plaintiff and the judge, the expression of contending is appropriate for Him, for He, too, presents His claim to find their iniquity and their transgression. Comp. (Ezekiel 38:22) “And I will contend with him (וְנִשְׁפַּטְתִּי)”; (Jer. 2:35) “Behold, I contend with you.” It is an expression of debate. Derajjsner in O.F. [And its simple meaning is: For with the fire of the Lord and with His sword, all flesh shall be judged. Similarly, there are many inverted verses in Scriptures.]

### passuk 17
<b>Those who prepare themselves</b> Heb. הַמִּתְקַדְּשִׁים. Those who prepare themselves, “Let you and me go on such-and-such a day to worship such-and-such an idol.”
<b>to the gardens</b> where they plant vegetables, and there they would erect idols.
<b>[one] after one</b> As Jonathan renders: a company after a company. They prepare themselves and purify themselves to worship, one company after its fellow has completed its worship.
<b>in the middle</b> In the middle of the garden. Such was their custom to erect it.

### passuk 18
<b>And I - their deeds and their thoughts have come etc.</b> And I What am I to do? Their deeds and their thoughts have come to Me. And that forces Me to gather all the heathens (nations [Mss. and K’li Paz]), and to let them know that their deeds are vanity and the thoughts they are thinking, “For the sake of my name, the Lord shall be glorified,” let them understand that it is false. And where is the gathering? It is the gathering that Zechariah prophesied (14:2): “And I will gather all the nations to Jerusalem.”
<b>and they shall see My glory</b> When I wage war with them with the plague of the following description (ibid. 14:12): “Their flesh shall disintegrate...and their eyes...and their tongue.”

### passuk 19
<b>And I will place a sign upon them etc.</b> Refugees will survive the war, and I will allow them to remain in order to go to report to the distant islands My glory that they saw in the war, and also upon those refugees I will place one of the signs with which their colleagues were punished, in order to let the distant ones know that with this plague, those who gathered about Jerusalem were smitten.

### passuk 20
<b>and with covered wagons</b> Heb. וּבַצַּבִּים. These are wagons equipped with partitions and a tent. Comp. (Num. 7:3) “Six covered wagons (עֶגְלוֹתצָב).”
<b>and with joyous songs</b> Heb. וּבַכִּרְכָּרוֹת. With a song of players and dancers. Comp. (II Sam. 6:14) “And David danced (מְכַרְכֵּר),” treper in O.F. [Menahem (p. 109) explains it as an expression meaning a lamb. Comp. (supra 16:1) “Send lambs (כַּר) of the ruler of the land.”]
<b>as...bring</b> an offering in a pure vessel for acceptance, so will they bring your brethren as an acceptable offering.

### passuk 21
<b>And from them too</b> From the peoples bringing them and from those brought, I will take priests and Levites, for they are now assimilated among the heathens (nations [Mss. and K’li Paz]) under coercion, and before Me the priests and the Levites among them are revealed, and I will select them from among them, and they shall minister before Me, said the Lord. Now where did He say it? (Deut. 29:28) “The hidden things are for the Lord our God.” In this manner it is explained in the Aggadah of Psalms (87:6).

### passuk 22

### passuk 23

### passuk 24
<b>their worm</b> The worm that consumes their flesh.
<b>and their fire</b> in Gehinnom.
<b>and abhorring</b> Heb. דֵרָאוֹן, an expression of contempt. Jonathan, however, renders it as two words: enough (דֵּי) seeing (רְאִיָה), until the righteous say about them, We have seen enough.
