### passuk 1
<b>Sing, you barren woman</b> Jerusalem, who was as though she had not borne.
<b>you who have not experienced birth pangs</b> Heb. חָלָה, an expression of childbirth, for the woman in confinement gives birth with pains and writhing.
<b>for the children of the desolate one</b> The daughter of Edom.

### passuk 2
<b>and let them stretch forth</b> far off.
<b>lengthen your cords</b> These are thin ropes that hang at the bottom of tents, and that are tied to stakes called ‘chevills’ in French, which are thrust into the ground.

### passuk 3
<b>shall you prevail</b> Heb. תִּפְרֹצִי, shall you prevail.

### passuk 4

### passuk 5

### passuk 6
<b>who was rejected</b> When she is rejected at times that her husband is a little wroth with her.

### passuk 7

### passuk 8
<b>With a little wrath</b> Heb. שֶׁצֶף. Menahem (Machbereth p. 179) interprets this as, “with kindling of wrath,” and Dunash (Teshuvoth p. 20) states, “with a little wrath,” paralleling “For a small moment have I forsaken you,” and so did Jonathan render.
<b>and with everlasting kindness</b> that will exist forever.

### passuk 9
<b>For this is to Me [as] the waters of Noah</b> [i.e.,] it is an oath in My hand, and He proceeds to explain His words, “as I swore that the waters of Noah shall never again pass over the earth, etc.”

### passuk 10
<b>For the mountains shall depart</b> Even if the merit of the Patriarchs and the Matriarchs is depleted, My kindness shall not depart from you.

### passuk 11
<b>tempestuous one</b> whose heart storms with many troubles.
<b>I will set with carbuncle</b> I pave your floor with carbuncle stones.

### passuk 12
<b>jasper</b> Heb. כַּדְכֹד, a kind of precious stone.
<b>your windows</b> Jonathan renders: your woodwork, and Menahem associated it with (Dan. 7:10): “ministered to Him (יְשַׁמְּשׁוּנֵהּ).” (Menahem, apparently renders: your utensils, i.e., the vessels that serve you.) And some interpret it as an expression of a sun (שֶׁמֶשׁ), windows through which the sun shines, and they make opposite it a barrier of kinds of colored glass for beauty, and Midrash Psalms interprets שִׁמְשׁוֹתַיִךְ as well as שֶׁמֶשׁ וּמָגֵן (Ps. 84:12) as “the pinnacles of the wall.”
<b>of carbuncle stones</b> Heb. אֶקְדָּח. Jonathan renders: of gomer stones. Gumrin is the Aramaic translation of גֶּחָלִים, coals. He interprets אֶקְדָּח as an expression similar to (supra 50: 11) “who kindle (קֹדְחֵי) fire,” and they are a type of stones that burn like torches and that is the carbuncle (karbokle in O.F.), an expression of a coal. Others interpret it as an expression of a drill, i.e., huge stones of which the entire opening of the doorway is drilled, and the doorposts, the threshold, and the lintel are all hewn from the stone.
<b>of precious stones</b> Desirable stones [from Jonathan].

### passuk 13

### passuk 14
<b>go far away from oppression</b> [Although grammatically this is the imperative, here it is the future,] like (supra 52:2) “Shake yourself from the dust.” You will be far away from those who oppress you.
Printed editions of Rashi contain the following addendum: (<b>go far away from oppression</b> You will stay far from oppressing other peoples in the manner the wicked do, that they accumulate money through robbery, but you will not need to rob, for you will not fear poverty or straits, or ruin, for it shall neither come nor shall it approach you. [Abarbanel])
(<b>With righteousness</b> that you will perform, you will be established with an everlasting redemption, and you will be far from people’s oppression for you will not fear; you will not even have terror or fear of them, and you will be far from ruin, for it will not come near you. [Ayalah Sheluchah])

### passuk 15
<b>Behold, the one with whom I am not, shall fear</b> Heb. גּוֹר יָגוּר. Behold, he shall fear and dread evil decrees, he with whom I am not, i.e., Esau. ([Mss. read:] the wicked Esau and his ilk.)
<b>whoever mobilizes against you</b> Heb. גָר. Whoever mobilizes against you for war. Alternatively, מִי גָר [means:] whoever contends with you (וְנִתְגָּרֶה). And our Rabbis explained it as referring to the proselytes (גֵּרִים), [i.e.,] to say that we will not accept proselytes in Messianic times. And even according to the simple meaning of the verse it is possible to explain: whoever became sojourners with you in your poverty, shall dwell with you in your wealth. Comp. (Gen. 25:18) “In the presence of all his brethren he dwelt (נָפָל).”

### passuk 16
<b>Behold I</b> am He Who created a smith who devises a weapon, and I am He Who has created a destroyer that destroys it. That is, to say: I am He Who incited the enemy against you; I am He Who has prepared retribution for him.
<b>and produces a weapon for his work</b> For necessity. He completes it according to all that is necessary.

### passuk 17
<b>Any weapon whetted against you</b> Any weapon that they will whet and sharpen for you, i.e., to battle with you.
<b>whetted</b> Heb. יוּצַר, an expression similar to (Jos. 5:2) “sharp knives (חַרְבוֹתצֻרִים),” also (Ps. 89:44) “You have also turned the edge of his sword (צוּר חַרְבּוֹ).”
