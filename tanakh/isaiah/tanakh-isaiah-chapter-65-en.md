### passuk 1
I gave access to them that asked not for Me, I was at hand to them that sought Me not; I said: ‘Behold Me, behold Me’, unto a nation that was not called by My name.

### passuk 2
I have spread out My hands all the day unto a rebellious people, that walk in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts;

### passuk 3
A people that provoke Me to My face continually, that sacrifice in gardens, and burn incense upon bricks;

### passuk 4
That sit among the graves, and lodge in the vaults; that eat swine’s flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;

### passuk 5
That say: ‘Stand by thyself, come not near to me, for I am holier than thou’; these are a smoke in My nose, a fire that burneth all the day. .

### passuk 6
Behold, it is written before Me; I will not keep silence, except I have requited, Yea, I will requite into their bosom,

### passuk 7
Your own iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the LORD, that have offered upon the mountains, and blasphemed Me upon the hills; therefore will I first measure their wage into their bosom.

### passuk 8
Thus saith the LORD: As, when wine is found in the cluster, One saith: ‘Destroy it not, For a blessing is in it’; So will I do for My servants’ sakes, That I may not destroy all.

### passuk 9
And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of My mountains; and Mine elect shall inherit it, And My servants shall dwell there.

### passuk 10
And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in, for My people that have sought Me;

### passuk 11
But ye that forsake the LORD, That forget My holy mountain, That prepare a table for Fortune, And that offer mingled wine in full measure unto Destiny,

### passuk 12
I will destine you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter; because when I called, ye did not answer, when I spoke, ye did not hear; But ye did that which was evil in Mine eyes, And chose that wherein I delighted not.

### passuk 13
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, My servants shall eat, But ye shall be hungry; Behold, My servants shall drink, But ye shall be thirsty; Behold, My servants shall rejoice, But ye shall be ashamed;

### passuk 14
Behold, My servants shall sing For joy of heart, But ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, And shall wail for vexation of spirit.

### passuk 15
And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto Mine elect: ‘So may the Lord GOD slay thee’; But He shall call His servants by another name;

### passuk 16
So that he who blesseth himself in the earth Shall bless himself by the God of truth; And he that sweareth in the earth Shall swear by the God of truth; Because the former troubles are forgotten, And because they are hid from Mine eyes.

### passuk 17
For, behold, I create new heavens And a new earth; And the former things shall not be remembered, Nor come into mind. .

### passuk 18
But be ye glad and rejoice for ever In that which I create; For, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, And her people a joy.

### passuk 19
And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, And joy in My people; And the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, Nor the voice of crying.

### passuk 20
There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man, That hath not filled his days; For the youngest shall die a hundred years old, And the sinner being a hundred years old shall be accursed.

### passuk 21
And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; And they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.

### passuk 22
They shall not build, and another inhabit, They shall not plant, and another eat; For as the days of a tree shall be the days of My people, And Mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.

### passuk 23
They shall not labour in vain, Nor bring forth for terror; For they are the seed blessed of the LORD, And their offspring with them.

### passuk 24
And it shall come to pass that, before they call, I will answer, And while they are yet speaking, I will hear.

### passuk 25
The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, And the lion shall eat straw like the ox; And dust shall be the serpent’s food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain, Saith the LORD.
