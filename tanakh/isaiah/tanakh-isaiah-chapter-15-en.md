The burden of Moab. For in the night that Ar of Moab is laid waste, He is brought to ruin; for in the night that Kir of Moab is laid waste, He is brought to ruin.

### passuk 2
He is gone up to Baith, and to Dibon, to the high places, to weep; upon Nebo, and upon Medeba, Moab howleth; on all their heads is baldness, every beard is shaven.

### passuk 3
In their streets they gird themselves with sackcloth; On their housetops, and in their broad places, Every one howleth, weeping profusely.

### passuk 4
And Heshbon crieth out, and Elealeh; their voice is heard even unto Jahaz; therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud; his soul is faint within him.

### passuk 5
My heart crieth out for Moab; her fugitives reach unto Zoar, a heifer of three years old; for by the ascent of Luhith With weeping they go up; for in the way of Horonaim they raise up a cry of destruction.

### passuk 6
For the Waters of Nimrim shall be desolate; For the grass is withered away, the herbage faileth, There is no green thing.

### passuk 7
Therefore the abundance they have gotten, And that which they have laid up, Shall they carry away to the brook of the willows.

### passuk 8
For the cry is gone round about The borders of Moab; The howling thereof unto Eglaim, And the howling thereof unto Beer-elim.

### passuk 9
For the waters of Dimon are full of blood; For I will bring yet more upon Dimon, A lion upon him that escapeth of Moab, And upon the remnant of the land.
