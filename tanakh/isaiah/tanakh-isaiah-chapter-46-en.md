### passuk 1
Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth; their idols are upon the beasts, and upon the cattle; the things that ye carried about are made a load, a burden to the weary beast.

### passuk 2
They stoop, they bow down together, they could not deliver the burden; and themselves are gone into captivity.

### passuk 3
Hearken unto Me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, that are borne [by Me] from the birth, that are carried from the womb:

### passuk 4
Even to old age I am the same, and even to hoar hairs will I carry you; I have made, and I will bear; yea, I will carry, and will deliver.

### passuk 5
To whom will ye liken Me, and make Me equal, and compare Me, that we may be like?

### passuk 6
Ye that lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance; ye that hire a goldsmith, that he make it a god, to fall down thereto, yea, to worship.

### passuk 7
He is borne upon the shoulder, he is carried, and set in his place, and he standeth, from his place he doth not remove; yea, though one cry unto him, he cannot answer, nor save him out of his trouble.

### passuk 8
Remember this, and stand fast; bring it to mind, O ye transgressors.

### passuk 9
Remember the former things of old: That I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like Me;

### passuk 10
Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times things that are not yet done; Saying: ‘My counsel shall stand, and all My pleasure will I do’;

### passuk 11
Calling a bird of prey from the east, the man of My counsel from a far country; Yea, I have spoken, I will also bring it to pass, I have purposed, I will also do it.

### passuk 12
Hearken unto Me, ye stout-hearted, That are far from righteousness:

### passuk 13
I bring near My righteousness, it shall not be far off, And My salvation shall not tarry; And I will place salvation in Zion For Israel My glory.
