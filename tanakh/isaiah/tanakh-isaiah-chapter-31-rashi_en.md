<b>Woe</b> Concerning Hoshea and the ten tribes who went down to Egypt for aid, who sent emissaries to So, king of Egypt (II Kings 17).
<b>on horses</b> that come from there, for they are swift runners.
<b>rely</b> (יִשָּׁעֵנוּ) and they did not rely on the Holy One of Israel as Hezekiah did, concerning whom it is written: (II Kings 18:5,7): “He trusted in the Lord God of Israel...and he rebelled against the king of Assyria.”

### passuk 2
<b>and His words He did not retract</b> What He said, “And the Lord shall take you back to Egypt in ships” (Deut. 28:68). This is payment in kind, for I said to you, “You shall no longer see it (ibid.),” and you went there of your own free will. Eventually, you shall go there in exile against your will.
<b>and He rose</b> on the ten tribes, who are a house of evildoers, and on the Egyptians who came to their aid.

### passuk 3
<b>shall turn His hand</b> For the Holy One, blessed be He, supports everything with His hand, and when He turns it, they will fall, like one who holds something in his hand, and when he inclines his hand, it falls. So is the Midrash Aggadah (Mechilta, Exodus 15:12). Jonathan, however, renders: shall raise the blow of His might.

### passuk 4
<b>As...growls</b> (יֶהְגֶּה) a roaring sound. Comp. (infra 59:11) “And like doves we will moan (הָגֹה נֶהְגֶּה) .”
<b>although a band of shepherds gather against him</b> (יִקָּרֵא, lit., will be called.) They will gather upon him with a stirring shout.
<b>band of shepherds</b> (מְלֹא) a gathering of shepherds. Comp. (Jer. 12:6) “They called after you a band (מָלֵא).” Comp. also (Job 16:10) “Together they gather (יִתְמַלָּאוּן) against me.” All of these are expressions of gathering.
<b>he is not subdued</b> (יַעֲנֶה) he will not humble himself, he will not make himself as a poor man. Comp. (Exodus 10:3) “To humble yourself (לֵעָנוֹת) from before Me.” Comp. also (Hosea 5:5) “And the pride of Israel shall be humbled (וְעָנָה).”
<b>so shall...descend</b> (This intimates that God will descend) and will not be afraid of the stirring (or the multitude) of the nations.

### passuk 5
<b>passing over</b> (פָּסוֹחַ) passing over. Alternatively, it may be interpreted as an expression of sparing.
<b>and rescuing</b> He will extricate Israel from the strait. This is an expression of rescue (esmoucer in O. F.).

### passuk 6
<b>Return</b> To the One about Whom you have thought deeply how to turn away from Him, now return to Him.

### passuk 7

### passuk 8

### passuk 9
<b>And his rock shall pass from fear</b> And his strength shall be weakened from great fear.
<b>shall be dismayed at the miracle</b> Because of the great miracles that the Holy One, blessed be He, performs for Israel.
<b>whose fire is in Zion</b> There the fire will be prepared to burn them.
