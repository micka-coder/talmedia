<b>“The Lord will surely separate me from His people,”</b> Why should I become converted? Will not the Holy One, blessed be He, separate me from His people when He pays their reward.
<b>Let not the eunnuch say</b> Why should I better my ways and my deeds? I am like a withered tree, for lack of remembrance.

<b>I will yet gather</b> of the heathens ([Mss. and K’li Paz:] of the nations) who will convert and join them. (

### passuk 9
<b>All the beasts of the field</b> All the proselytes of the heathens ([Mss. and K’li Paz:] All the nations) come and draw near to Me, and you shall devour all the beasts in the forest, the mighty of the heathens ([Mss. and K’li Paz:] the mighty of the nations) who hardened their heart and refrained from converting.
<b>the beasts of the field</b> [The beast of the field is not as strong as the beast of the forest.] The beast of the field is weaker and of weaker strength than the beast of the forest. Since he stated, “I will yet gather others to him,” he stated this verse.

### passuk 10
<b>His lookouts are all blind</b> Since he said, “Seek the Lord,” and the entire section, and they do not heed, he returns and says, Behold the prophets cry out to them ([Mss.:] to you) and announce concerning repentance, so that it will be good for them. Yet their leaders are all like blind men, and they do not see the results, like a lookout appointed to see the approaching army, to warn the people, but he is blind, unable to see whether the army is coming, and dumb, unable to warn the people, like a dog that was appointed to guard the house, but he is dumb, unable to bark. Similarly, the leaders of Israel do not warn them to repent to do good.

<b>And the dogs are of greedy disposition</b> wanting to fill their stomachs [engrote talent in O.F.], sick with hunger.
<b>and they are shepherds</b> Just as the dogs know no satiety, neither do the shepherds know to understand what will occur at the end of days.
<b>they all</b> turned to the way of their benefit, each one to his gain, to rob the rest of the people over whom they are appointed.
<b>every last one</b> Heb. מִקָּצֵהוּ, [lit. from its end.] Comp. (Gen. 19:4) “all the people from the end (מִקָּצֶה),” from one end of their number until its other end, they all behave in this manner.

### passuk 12

<b>and tomorrow shall be like this</b> with feasting and drinking.
