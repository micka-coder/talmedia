### passuk 2
<b>Who aroused from the East</b> one whom righteousness accompanied? Who aroused Abraham to bring him from Aram which is in the East and the righteousness that he would perform that was opposite his feet wherever he went.
<b>He placed nations before him</b> He, Who aroused him to leave his place to cause him to move, He placed before him four kings and their hosts.
<b>He gave him dominion</b> Heb. יַרְדְּ, like יַרָדֶּה.
<b>He made his sword like dust</b> [Jonathan paraphrases:] He cast slain ones before his sword like dust. He suffered his sword to take its toll of casualties as [numerous as] grains of dust, and his bow He suffered to take its toll of casualties who would fall like wind blown stubble.

### passuk 3
<b>He pursued them and passed on safely</b> He traversed all his fords safely; he did not stumble when he pursued them.
<b>a path upon which he had not come with his feet</b> A road upon which he had not come previously with his feet. [The future tense of] יָבוֹא means that he was not accustomed to come.

### passuk 4

<b>I, the Lord, am first</b> to perform wonders and to aid.
<b>and with the last ones I am He</b> Also with you, the last sons, I will be, and I will aid you.

דֶּבֶק is soudure in French, weld.
<b>and he strengthened it</b> The idol.
<b>with nails that it should not move</b> All of them will strengthen each other.

### passuk 8
<b>But you, Israel My servant</b> and I am obliged to help you. The end of this sentence is (infra 10): “Do not fear.” This appears to me to be the sequence of the section according to its simple meaning. But the Midrash Aggadah in Gen. Rabbah 44:7 expounds the entire section as alluding to Malchizedek and Abraham.
<b>[5] Islands saw</b> the war and feared. Shem [Malchizedek] feared Abraham, lest he say to him, You begot these wicked men in the world. And Abraham feared Shem, since he slew his sons, the people of Elam, who was descended from Shem.
<b>islands</b> Just as the islands of the sea are distinguished and recognized in the sea, so were Abraham and Shem distinguished in the world.
<b>[6] Each one aided his fellow</b> This one [Shem] aided this one [Abraham] with blessings, “Blessed be Abram” (Gen. 14:19), and this one [Abraham] aided this one [Shem] with gifts, “And he gave him tithe from everything” (ibid. verse 20).
<b>[7] And the craftsman strengthened</b> This is Shem, who was a blacksmith, to make nails and bars for the ark.
<b>the smith</b> This is Abraham, who purified (צוֹרֵף) the people, to bring them near to God [lit. to Heaven].
<b>the sledge hammer</b> This is Abraham, who smote (הָלַם) all these kings at one time.
<b>He says of the cement</b> Heb. דֶּבֶק. The nations said, It is good to cleave to this one’s God [rather than to Nimrod’s idols].
<b>And he strengthened him</b> Shem strengthened Abraham to cleave to the Holy One, blessed be He, and not to move.
<b>[8] And you, Israel My servant</b> Abraham, who was not descended from righteous men—I did all this for him, and you, Israel My servant, who belong to Me by dint of two forefathers.
<b>the seed of Abraham, who loved Me</b> who did not recognize Me because of the admonition and the teaching of his fathers, but out of love.

### passuk 9
<b>whom I grasped</b> Heb. הֶחֱזַקְתִּיךָ. I took you for My share. Comp. (Ex. 4:4) “And he stretched out his hand and grasped (וַיְּחֲזֵק) it.”
<b>from the ends of the earth</b> from the other nations.
<b>and from its nobles</b> from the greatest of them.
<b>I called you</b> by name for My share, “My firstborn son, Israel” (ibid. v. 22).
<b>and I did not despise you</b> like Esau, as it is said (Malachi 1:3), “And Esau I hated.”

### passuk 10
<b>be not discouraged</b> Heb. אַל תִּשְׁתָּע. Let your heart not melt like wax (שַׁעֲוָה). This is the rule: Every word whose first radical is ‘shin,’ when it is used in the reflexive present, past, or future, the ‘tav’ separates it and enters between the first two radicals. Comp. (infra 49:16) “And He was astounded (וַיַּשְׁתּוֹמֵם)”; (Micah 6:16) “For the statutes of Omri shall be observed (וְיִשְׁתַּמֵּר)”; (I Sam. 1: 14) “will you be drunk (תִּשְׁתַּכָּרִין)?”; (Job 30:16) “My soul is poured out (תִּשְׁתַּפֵּךְ).”

### passuk 11

### passuk 12

### passuk 13

### passuk 14
<b>O worm of Jacob</b> Heb. תּוֹלַעַת. The family of Jacob, which is weak like a worm, which has no strength except in its mouth. תּוֹלַעַת is vermener in O.F., [vermisseau in Modern French, a worm].
<b>the number of Israel</b> Heb. מְתֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל, the number of Israel.

### passuk 15
<b>a...grooved threshing sledge</b> It is a heavy wooden implement made with many grooves, similar to the ironsmiths’ tool known as ‘lime’ in French, a file, and they drag it over the straw of the ears of grain and it cuts them until they become fine straw.
<b>new</b> When it is new, before the points of its grooves are smoothed off, it cuts very much, but when it becomes old, the points of the grooves are smoothed off.
<b>with sharp points</b> Heb. פִּיפִיוֹת. Those are the points of the grooves.
<b>you shall thresh the mountains</b> kings and princes.

### passuk 16
<b>You shall winnow them</b> You shall scatter them, as with a pitchfork, to the wind.
<b>and a wind shall carry them off</b> by themselves to Gehinnom.

### passuk 17
<b>seek water</b> The prophet prophesied concerning the end of days (Amos 8:11), “Not a famine for bread nor a thirst for water, but to hear the words of the Lord...They shall wander to seek the word of the Lord, but they shall not find it.” And when His wrath subsides, He shall prepare for them bread and water and cause His Shechinah and His spirit to rest in the mouth of their prophets.
<b>is parched</b> Heb. נָשָׁתָּה. An expression similar to (supra 19:5) “And water from the sea shall dry up (וְנִשְּׁתּוּ).” An expression similar to (Lam. 3:45) “The destruction (הַשֵּׁאת) and the breach.” And all of them are an expression of destruction and dryness. Therefore, a ‘dagesh’ appears in the ‘tav,’ since it comes instead of two, for there is no שֵׁאת without a ‘tav,’ and he should have said for the feminine וְנָשָׁתְתָה, since for the masculine singular he says נשתה and for the plural ונשתו.

### passuk 18
<b>rivers</b> an understanding heart for Torah and prophecy.
<b>a desert</b> A place where there was no Torah wisdom.

### passuk 19
<b>I will give in the desert cedars, acacia trees</b> all kinds of civilization. Even in them will I give all kinds of wisdom, goodness, and peace.
<b>firs and cypresses</b> Names of trees that do not produce fruit, used for building.

### passuk 20

### passuk 21
<b>Present your plea</b> All the heathens ([mss. K’li Paz:] nations), come and contend and debate with My children.
<b>your strong points</b> Heb. עַצֻּמוֹתֵיכֶם, Your sturdy and strong arguments. This is an expression of a dispute in Mishnaic Hebrew: “Two who were engaged in a legal dispute (מִתְעַצְּמִין),” in Tractate Sanhedrin (31b).

### passuk 22
<b>Let them present</b> Let those who deny the Torah ([mss., K’li Paz:] the nations) present their prophets and their soothsayers.
<b>and tell us what will happen</b> in the future.
<b>the first things</b> that were before the Creation of the world, and concerning what was created and what they are. (Other editions: The incidents that have already begun, what will be their end.)
<b>or the coming events</b> in the future, let us hear, and we will see if there is any substance to them, that their words will come true.

### passuk 23
<b>Tell the signs coming later</b> Heb. הָאוֹתִיוֹתלְאָחוֹר, the wonders coming at the end.
<b>let us talk</b> Heb. וְנִשְׁתָּעָה. Let us tell your words. (Gen. 24:66) “And he told (וַיְּסַפֵּר),” the Targum renders וְאִשְׁתָּעֵי.

### passuk 24
<b>Behold you are of naught</b> and how will your words be fulfilled.
<b>and your deed is one of shouting</b> Heb. מֵאָפַע. You shout and raise your voice only to mislead the people with lies.
<b>the abominable one</b> Heb. תּוֹעֵבָה [lit. an abomination.] The abominable ones select you, and not the Holy One, blessed be He, or His servants or His ministers.

### passuk 25
<b>I have aroused from the north and he came</b> I tell the future events. Behold I arouse Cyrus from the north to build the ruins of Jerusalem, and he came upon Babylon to destroy it.
<b>from the rising of the sun he shall call in My name</b> (Ezra 1:2) “All the kingdoms of the earth has the Lord God of the heavens given me.” And it appears that Persia is northeast of Eretz Israel. Another explanation is: I aroused Nebuchadnezzar from the north to destroy My city, and he came, and I aroused Cyrus from the east, that he call in My name to build My city, for the kingdom of Persia is east of Eretz Israel, as it is stated (Dan. 8:4): “I saw the ram butting etc.” [This verse in Daniel proves it. “I saw the ram butting to the west and to the north and to the south.” We deduce that he came from the east.] Jonathan paraphrases: I brought speedily a king, strong as the north wind, and he will come as the sun comes out with its might from the east; I will strengthen him with My name.
<b>and he shall come [upon] princes</b> And he shall come upon the king of Babylon and upon his princes as he would come to trample upon mire, and as a potter tramples clay for earthenware vessels, so will he trample the princes.

### passuk 26
<b>Who</b> of the prophets of Baal told, like me, a thing destined to come, and who told it from before, that when it comes we will say that he is just, that his prophecy is just?
<b>Not one told</b> But there is none among you who will foretell the future and that it will come true.
<b>not one hears your statements</b> Who will testify when the future comes, that so and so the prophet of the Baal prophesied this from before.

### passuk 27
<b>The first to Zion, behold, behold them</b> The first king who will give heart to Zion, behold he is the one I mentio ned, and even though the redemption will not be completed through him, he will be the one to initiate it. (Ezra 1:3) “Whoever of you from all His people...”
<b>behold them</b> The elders of Israel will be ready, according to his statement, to go up from the exile and to begin.
<b>and for Jerusalem I will give a herald</b> in those days, [viz.] Haggai and Zechariah, who will encourage them to build it in the days of Darius III of Persia.

### passuk 28
<b>And I look and there is no man</b> [lit. and I will see, in the future tense.] I always look at the prophets of Baal, and there is no man who tells of a future event.
<b>and of these</b> of all these destined to come, and none of them is a counselor who stood in God’s counsel and will know them.
<b>and I ask them that they reply with a word</b> That they should reply with a word if I should ask them.

### passuk 29
<b>Behold them all,...naught</b> You should know that, as for the prophets of those who deny the Torah ([mss.:] pagan prophets;) ([other mss.:] prophets of Baal), all their deeds are naught and of no substance.
<b>their molten images</b> Heb. נִסְכֵּיהֶם. Comp. (supra 40:19) “The graven image the craftsman melted (נָסַךְ).” Jonathan renders this section differently: [27] <b>The first one to Zion etc.</b> The words of consolation that the prophets prophesied concerning Zion, from before, behold they have come. And according to the Targum, the entire section speaks of the King Messiah and of the last redemption, but I see that the prophecy that Isaiah prophesied concerning Cyrus is all in the same language as this section. Comp. (infra 45:13) “I aroused him with righteousness”; (Infra 46:11) “Calling from the east a bird of prey”; (infra 45:11) “The signs ask Me;” (infra 46:10) “Who tells from the beginning the end.” All of this resembles the topic of this section.
