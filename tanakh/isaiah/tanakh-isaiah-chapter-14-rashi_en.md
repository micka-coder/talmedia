### passuk 1
<b>For the Lord shall have mercy on Jacob</b> to keep for them the promise of their redemption from Babylonia.
<b>and again choose Israel</b> in the future, He shall redeem them with a complete redemption.
<b>and join</b> And they shall be added on. Comp. (I Sam. 2:36) “Take me now into... (סָפְחֵנִי)” and also (ibid. 27:19) “From cleaving to the Lord’s heritage (מֵהִסְתַּפֵּחַ).”

### passuk 2
<b>shall inherit</b> they shall inherit from them, and similarly, “and you shall hold onto them as an inheritance” (Lev. 25:46).
<b>and rule</b> Heb. וְרָדוּ, an expression of ruling and dominating, as (Lev. 25: 46): “You shall not rule over him (תִרְדֶה).”

### passuk 3
<b>on the day the Lord allows you to rest</b> Scripture is addressing Israel.
<b>from your sorrow and from your shuddering</b> which the king of Babylon saddened you and caused you to shudder, and when you see his downfall, you will be eased, since you will go out free.

### passuk 4
<b>the haughty one</b> Heb. מַדְהֵבָה. An expression of an excess of haughtiness and a heavy burden. Our Rabbis, however, expound it as: Those who say, ‘Measure and bring.’

### passuk 5
<b>The Lord has broken the staff of the wicked</b> For he would smite peoples with wrath.

### passuk 6
<b>pursued without relenting</b> Every nation was pursued by him without his relenting from pursuing and chasing each nation.

### passuk 7
<b>opened [their mouth] in song</b> This is the song they recited, “All the land rested, became tranquil.”

### passuk 8
<b>Box trees, too, rejoiced</b> Rulers, too, rejoiced [from Jonathan]; i.e., they rejoiced at your downfall.

### passuk 9
<b>toward your arrival</b> When you descend to Gehinnom, and what is the quaking? To arouse toward you...
<b>giants</b> Heb. רְפָאִים, the giants lying there.
<b>all the chiefs of the earth</b> [lit. the he-goats.] All the kings of the nations, the princes, and the princesses, are compared by Scripture, to bulls, to cows, and to he-goats. Comp. (Psalms 22:13) “Bulls surrounded me.” Also (Amos 4:1): “The cows of the Bashan that were on Mt. Shomron,” and here he compares them to he-goats.
<b>he caused to rise</b> he threw
<b>from their thrones</b> [i.e.,] the messenger of Gehinnom caused all the kings of the nations [to rise] from their thrones. [according to mss. and Shem Ephraim]

### passuk 10
<b>Have you too become weak like us</b> We are amazed how the misfortune has fallen upon you, that you too have become weak, to be like us, to die.

### passuk 11
<b>the stirring of your psalteries</b> The psalteries and harps that used to play before you. It is also possible to interpret, הֶמְיַתנְבָלֶיךָ as, the stirring of the wanton ones, who commit wanton acts, of your armies, and it seems to me that in the great Masorah, this was combined with (Amos 5:21) “The song of your psalteries,” in the aleph-beth of two meanings.

### passuk 12
<b>Lucifer, the morning star</b> This is Venus, which gives light as the morning star, הֵילֵל being derived from יהל, to shed light. This is the lamentation over the heavenly prince of Babylon, who will fall from heaven.
<b>You have been cut down to earth</b> You, Nebuchadnezzar, who would cast lots on nations. You would cast lots on them, on the kings, who of them would serve you on such and such a day, and who on such and such a day. Our Rabbis, however, expounded this to mean that he would cast lots on the kings for purposes of pederasty.

### passuk 13
<b>above the stars of God</b> Israel.
<b>on the mount of the assembly</b> The mount where all assemble, i.e., Mount Zion.
<b>in the farthest end of the north</b> In the forecourt, the chosen place, the north side, as the matter is stated (Lev. 1:11): “On the side of the altar to the north.”

### passuk 14
<b>I will ascend above the heights of the clouds</b> I am not fit to dwell with mortals. I will make myself a small cloud in the air and I will dwell there. Jonathan renders: I will ascend over all nations.

### passuk 15

### passuk 16
<b>shall look at you</b> They will look through holes and cracks [aboater in O.F.].
<b>shall gaze earnestly</b> [Por panser in O.F.] To think of oneself.

### passuk 17
<b>he did not open the house</b> Heb. בָּיְתָה. He did not open their house of imprisonment to release them all the days of their lives, to allow them to go to their home. Every word that requires a ‘lammed’ at the beginning Scripture placed a ‘heh’ to it at the end.

### passuk 18
<b>each in his house</b> In his grave, and so did Jonathan render: In his eternal house.

### passuk 19
<b>like a despised sapling</b> Like a sapling of a tree, which is despised by its owner, who digs it up and uproots it and takes it out. So were you cast out of your grave. The Sages stated (Lev. Rabbah 18:2): When he became an animal and a wild beast for seven years, the populace crowned Evil-Merodach, and when he was restored to his kingdom, he took him and imprisoned him in the dungeon until the day of his death. When he died, they took Evil-Merodach out of prison to crown him king, but he did not accept it upon himself. He said, If he returns to his kingdom, he will kill me. They said to him, He is dead and buried. But he did not believe them until they took him out of his grave and dragged him.
<b>[in] the garb of the slain</b> With filthy apparel, like that of the slain.
<b>of those pierced by the sword</b> Heb. מְטֹעֲנֵי, pierced by spears (sic). “Pierced” in Arabic is ‘mut’an.’
<b>who descend to the stones of the pit</b> to the depths of the pit, the place where stones sink there, you have descended.
<b>like a trampled corpse</b> Heb. מוּבָס. Jonathan renders: trampled, like (Ps. 44:6), “We will trample (נָבוּס) those who rise up against us”; (infra verse 25) “And on my mountains I will trample him (אֲבוּסֶנוּ)”; (Ezekiel 16: 6) “Trampled (מִתְבּוֹסֶסֶת) in your blood,” trampled like the mud of the streets.

### passuk 20
<b>You shall not join them in burial</b> You shall not be equal to other kings, to rest in your grave.
<b>for you have destroyed your land</b> with excessive labor, and you have slain your people groundlessly, as it is related in Daniel (2:12): “And he said to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.” Therefore, they hated you and treated you with contempt to throw you out of your grave.
<b>the seed of evil doers shall not be named forever</b> Even your children shall suffer for your iniquities, and they shall not endure long after you, for their enemies will unite against them and destroy them, and they shall say to each other.

### passuk 21
<b>Prepare a slaughter for his sons</b> lest they rise and inherit the land, and the land will be filled with enemies and oppressors. So did Jonathan render עַָרִים, enemies. Comp. (I Sam. 28:16) “And has become your adversary (עָרֶךְ).” It can also be interpreted: And fill the surface of the earth with cities. In contrast with what he said before (verse 17): “Who made the land like a desert and demolished his cities,” he says further: His seed shall perish, and the inhabitants of the cities shall return to their place, and the surface of the earth shall be filled with cities.

### passuk 22
<b>and a remnant</b> Heb. שְׁאָר, a remnant.
<b>and a son</b> Heb. וְנִין, a son ruling in the kingdom of his father.
<b>and a grandson</b> The son of the son. The son is Belshazzar, and the grandson [or granddaughter in this case] was Vashti.

### passuk 23
<b>hedgehog</b> Heb. קִפֹּד [hricon or hericon in O.F.] [In Modern French it is spelled herisson.]
<b>and I will sweep</b> Heb. וְטִאטֵאתִיהָ, an expression of sweeping [eskober in O.F.], as our Rabbis stated: The Rabbis did not know the meaning of וְטִאטֵאתִיהָ בְּמַטְאֲטֵא הַשְׁמֵד, until they heard [Rabbi’s (R. Judah Hanasi’s) maidservant say to her friend, “Take a broom (מַטְאֲטֵא) and sweep (וְטַאְטְאִי) the house.”]

### passuk 24
<b>as I thought</b> concerning Assyria, so it was. You, Nebuchadnezzar, saw that the words of the prophets of Israel about Sennacherib were fulfilled.

### passuk 25
<b>To break Assyria in My land</b> And with this you shall know that what I planned about you will remain as well.
<b>“To break...”</b> is connected to “As I thought, so it was.”
<b>will I trample him</b> Heb. אֲבוּסֶנוּ, which I said to tread upon him and trample him.

### passuk 26
<b>over all the nations</b> Over Assyria in its time and over Babylon in its time.

### passuk 27

### passuk 28
<b>In the year of King Ahaz’s death</b> and his son Hezekiah reigned, was this harsh prophecy concerning the Philistines given.

### passuk 29
<b>Rejoice not, Philistia, all of you</b> for you have lifted your head during the days of Ahaz, who was wicked, whose wickedness brought about that he was delivered into your hands, as the matter is stated in II Chron. 28:18: “And the Philistines raided the cities of the lowlands...”
<b>that the rod that smote you has been broken</b> that the kingdom of the House of David, which was wont to smite you, has been weakened and humbled, as we find concerning David, and so, concerning Uzziah, king of Judah, who smote you, as the matter is stated (II Chron. 26:6): “And he went out and fought against the Philistines and breached the wall of Gath.”
<b>for, from the root of a snake</b> From the root of that snake, shall emanate a venomous serpent, which is more formidable than a snake. Now who was this? This was Hezekiah, concerning whom it is stated (II Kings 18:8): “He slew the Philistines up to Gaza and its boundaries, from watchtower to fortified city.”
<b>and his offspring is a fiery flying serpent</b> Jonathan renders: And his deeds against you will be like flying snakes.

### passuk 30
<b>And the first born of the poor shall graze</b> In his days, the princes of Israel, who are now poor because of you, shall graze. “Firstborn,” is an expression of princes. Comp. (Ps. 89:28) “Also, I will appoint him My firstborn.”

### passuk 31
<b>for from the North smoke has come</b> Retribution harsh as smoke shall come upon them from the north. Gaza and its boundaries, which Hezekiah smote, were in the south of Eretz Israel in the southwestern corner. Eretz Israel is found to be north of it. And so we find in Sifrei in Ha’azinu 322: They attempted to flee through the south, and they turned them over, as it is stated (Amos 1:6): “For three transgressions of Gaza... [because of their exiling a complete exile to deliver to Edom.]” Hence, we learn that Gaza is on the south.
<b>and there is no straggler in his ranks</b> Jonathan renders: And there is no straggler among his appointed ones, i.e., in his ranks whom he appointed to come upon them, and no one delays his steps to be secluded and to come in seclusion alone, but all of them shall come as one, with strength.

### passuk 32
<b>And what shall the messengers of a nation announce</b> What shall the messengers of Israel, who go to bring news, announce in the days of Hezekiah? This is what they shall announce: The Lord has founded in Zion; He has set up therein a fitting and powerful king; the Lord is with him.
<b>and therein shall the poor of His people shelter themselves</b> Even from the ten tribes they would come there, as is related in II Chron. (30:6), “Hezekiah sent messengers throughout the border of Israel, to return to the Holy One, blessed be He.
