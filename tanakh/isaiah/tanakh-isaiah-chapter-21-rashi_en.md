<b>The harsh prophecy of the western desert</b> This prophecy refers to Babylonia, as is delineated therein. If you ask, Did he not already prophesy about it (supra 13): “On a tranquil mountain raise a banner,” and the entire chapter? sometimes the prophecy comes into his mouth today in one manner, and later in another manner.
<b>The harsh prophecy of the western desert</b> Jonathan paraphrases: A harsh prophecy concerning the armies that come from the desert, as numerous as the waters of the sea.
<b>like tempests in arid land, to pass</b> Like a tempest that whirls in an arid land, that raises much dust.
<b>to pass</b> So will many camps pass to come upon Babylon.
<b>from the desert</b> they shall come to them (lit.. to her).
<b>from an awesome land</b> Jonathan renders: From a land where mighty deeds have been performed. It is also possible to explain that it is a place of snakes and scorpions, as it is said (Deut. 8: 15): “The great and awesome desert.”

### passuk 2
<b>A harsh prophecy</b> The prophet says, “This harsh prophecy concerning Babylon was told to me.”
<b>the traitor shall be betrayed</b> Jonathan renders: The robbers are robbed and the plunderers are plundered. The Hebrew wording, according to the Targum, is to be explained thus: The traitor another will come and betray him; and the plunderer another will come and plunder him. These are Persia and Media, who rob and plunder Babylon, who, until now plundered and robbed all the countries.
<b>march, Elam</b> and come upon them (lit., her).
<b>besiege, O Media</b> (צוּרִי). I.e., besiege Babylon with a siege. Comp. (II Sam. 22:3) “God is my rock (צוּרִי).” The accent is on the latter syllable, on the “resh,” whereas, in this case, the accent is on the first syllable, like “rise (קוּמִי),” “return (שׁוּבִי).”
<b>all sighs have I brought to an end</b> (אַנְחָתָה). (This is) not (spelled with a) “Mappiq heh,” (which would mean “her sigh”) for this is like “all sighs in the world,” and it is an expression denoting a great sigh of many people (sospiradic in O.F.). All sighs have I brought to an end, for the world was sighing because of the yoke of the kingdom of Babylon; now I have brought it to an end.

### passuk 3
<b>my loins are filled with trembling</b> The prophet is merciful and sighs over the retribution meted out to the nations. This is the Midrash Aggadah (Tan., beginning of Balak). According to its simple meaning, however, the prophet is reciting the lamentation and the mourning as though this were Babylonia lamenting. pangs (צִירִים), an expression denoting trembling and pains. And our Rabbis said: A woman has doors and hinges (צִירִים) on her womb just as the doors of a house have hinges (Bechoroth 45a).
<b>I became confused</b> This is a malady known as עֲוִית, convulsions, in the language of the Sages.

### passuk 4
<b>fright</b> (פַּלָּצוּת). fright.
<b>the evening of my desire</b> The night that I longed for, for rejoicing and for a banquet. In the Book of Josipon we find that he was happy since his troops had defeated the army of Persia. (Book 1, ch. 5) That night He made for me into trembling, as it is said (Dan. 5:1): “King Belshazzar made a great feast...They drank wine...(verse 4). On that very night, King Belshazzar was slain...(verse 30).” (6:1) “And Darius the Mede received the kingdom.”

### passuk 5

<b>eating, drinking</b> And in the midst of the eating and the drinking, they cried, “Arise, princes!”
<b>anoint a shield</b> They were shields of boiled leather, and they would anoint them with oil so that the weapons would glide off. The same is mentioned concerning Saul (II Sam. 1:21): “For there the shield of the mighty was rejected.” It rejected its anointing and did not absorb it, and Saul’s shield became as though it was not anointed with oil.

### passuk 6
<b>Go set up the lookout</b> One of your disciples is destined to complain about My attribute, concerning the long prosperity of Babylon, and that was Habakkuk who made a circle and stood inside it, and said (Habakkuk 2:1), “On my watch will I stand, and I will look out to see what He will speak within me.” Said the Holy One, blessed be He, “Put up that lookout and promise him in My Name that he will stand on his watch and what he sees in the downfall of Babylon he will tell.”

### passuk 7
<b>And he shall see a chariot</b> and I will show him there a sort of chariot with a pair of riders, one riding a donkey and one riding a camel, and that is a sign of Persia and Media.
<b>and he shall listen attentively</b> And there he shall hear in his prophecy a representation of the mighty rumbling and stirring of armies.

### passuk 8
<b>And the lion called</b> That is Habakkuk. אַרְיֵה (lion) has the same numerical value as Habakkuk. Isaiah prophesied that Habakkuk was destined to pray for this and say the following.
<b>on the watchtower, O Lord</b> O Lord, my God, I always stand on the watchtower to inform me about this.

### passuk 9
<b>And behold this is coming</b> When he prays concerning this, he will see sort of a chariot of men, etc.
<b>Babylon has fallen, yea, it has fallen</b> Jonathan renders: Has fallen and is also destined to fall. This denotes two downfalls in two consecutive years, first through Media and Persia, and in the second year, through Heaven, as it is stated (supra 13:19): “And Babylon, the beauty of the kingdoms, the glory of the pride of the Chaldees, shall be like God’s overturning of Sodom...” And so we find in Seder Olam (ch. 28): And in that year the news came concerning Darius, and after him, in the year, the news, “And Babylon, the beauty of the kingdoms...shall be like the overturning, etc.” (supra 13:19).

### passuk 10
<b>My threshed grain and the product of my threshing floor</b> My hallowed grain, the stack of wheat which I was commanded by the Holy Spirit to rectify you and lead you on the straight path, like a man who threshes and winnows his grain on the threshing floor.
<b>What I heard</b> from Him I have related to you.

### passuk 11
<b>The harsh prophecy of Dumah</b> That is Edom, and so does Scripture say (Ezekiel 27:32): “Who is like Tyre, like Dumah in the midst of the sea?”
<b>To Me one calls from Seir</b> Said the Holy One, blessed be He: “To Me the prophet or the angel calls from the yoke of the kingdom of Seir.”
<b>Watchman, what will be of the night?</b> Watcher of Israel, what will be of this night and this darkness?

### passuk 12

<b>and also night</b> is prepared for the wicked at the time of the end.
<b>if you will request, request</b> If you make your request to hasten the end of the exile.
<b>return and come</b> in repentance.

### passuk 13
<b>The harsh prophecy concerning Arabia</b> About the Arabs.
<b>In the forest in Arabia did you lodge</b> I saw what you did when Assyria exiled my people, and they begged their captors to lead them through your land, since you are the descendants of their uncles, perhaps you would have mercy on them, and you were going out and lodging in the forest, the road where the caravans pass.
<b>the roads of your cousins</b> the children of your uncle.

### passuk 14
<b>Toward the thirsty</b> it is customary to bring water, but you, the inhabitants of the land of Tema, did not do so, but with his bread they came before the wanderer; they brought them sorts of salty foods and blown up flasks full of air, and he would eat and ask to drink, and he would put the opening of the flask into his mouth, and the air would go into his innards, and he would die. Another explanation of “Toward the thirsty they bring water,” is as follows: I did not do so to your forefather, Ishmael; when he was thirsty, I revealed to him a well of water.

### passuk 15
<b>Since because of the swords they wandered</b> (I.e.,) my people (wandered).
<b>the outstretched sword</b> (נְטוּשָׁה), spread over the surface of the earth, as (I Sam. 30:16) “And behold, they were scattered (נְטוּשִׁים) over the entire landscape,” (II Sam. 5: 18) “And spread out (וַיִּנָּטְשׁוּ) in the Valley of Rephaim.” Another explanation is that נְטוּשָׁה is like לְטוּשָׁה, sharp. All letters whose sources are close to being from one place, (i.e., from one speech organ,) are interchangeable with one another, the ‘nun’ with the ‘lamed,’ as in the case stated (in Nehemiah 13: 7): “To make him a chamber (נִשְׁכָּה),” like לִשְׁכָּה.

### passuk 16
<b>like the year of a hireling</b> I will be exact with them to limit the time like a hireling, hired by years, who is exact with the time of the completion of his year.

### passuk 17
