### passuk 3
<b>to the house of the God of Jacob</b> Since he [Jacob] called it [the Temple site] Beth El [the house of God], therefore, it will be called on his name, but Abraham called it a mount, “On God’s mount shall He appear” (Gen. 22:14); Isaac called it a field, “to meditate in the field” (ibid. 24:63).

### passuk 4
<b>into plowshares</b> koltres in O.F.
<b>pruning hooks</b> sarpes in O.F. [serpes in modern French], with which they prune the vineyards.

### passuk 5
<b>O house of Jacob...</b> The nations will say this to them, and this verse refers back to the verse [commencing with], “And many peoples shall go...”
<b>come and let us go in the light of the Lord</b> They will say this to them. Jonathan, however, renders: And those of the house of Jacob will say, [“Come and let us go in the teaching of the Law of the Lord”].

### passuk 6
<b>For You have forsaken Your people, the house of Jacob</b> The prophet addresses the Shechinah and says, “For until now You have forsaken Your People because of their iniquity.” [Other editions read:] “...that which You have forsaken Your people was because of their iniquity, for they are full of [witchcraft] from the East,” and the entire section, and all the chapters follow one another, until (ch. 5) “I will sing now...” Therefore, in the end of days, when the sinners perish, it will be good for them(Parshandatha). (Another explanation is: The prophet admonishes them and says this to them, “For you have forsaken your people, O house of Jacob...” You have forgotten [the deed of your people—Parshandatha] the good deed through which you became a people, you house of Jacob.)
<b>for they are full...from the east</b> Their hosts have become full of the deeds of the Arameans who dwell in the East, who were sorcerers and used the name of pagan deities. [Other editions read:]...and used the name of defilement [sorcery and demonism—Rashi ad loc.], as we say in Ch. Chelek (Sanh. 91a): “Abraham gave gifts” (Gen. 25:6)He gave them the name of defilement and sent them away to the land of the East [as quoted by Parshandatha].
<b>and with children of gentiles they please themselves</b> They cohabit with the daughters of the heathens and mingle with them, and they would bear children to them, with whom they are always pleased, and they occupy themselves [with them] and long for them and bother with them. This is an expression similar to [that of] (Job 36:18) “lest he incite you because of abundance (בְּשֶׂפֶק)” [debatement in O.F].

<b>and man has become humble</b> [This refers to] great [men], heroes, and warriors.

### passuk 11
<b>The haughty eyes of man</b> [This means] the haughty spirit, and so every expression of haughty eyes in the Scriptures, as it is said: “Whoever is haughty of eye, lustful in heart...” (Ps. 101:5).

<b>and over all coveted floors</b> Heb. שְׂכִיוֹת, palaces paved with coverings of marble floors, similar to: (Lev. 26:1) and a covering stone (וְְאֶבֶן מַשְׂכִּית), since they cover the ground with it.

### passuk 17
<b>on that day</b> That is the Day of Judgment.

### passuk 18
<b>shall completely pass away</b> They will all pass away; they will all vanish.

### passuk 19

<b>and into the hollows</b> They are caves.
<b>when He rises</b> for Judgment Day.
<b>to break the earth</b> to break the wicked of the earth.

### passuk 20
<b>to prostrate himself to moles</b> Heb. לַחְפֹּר פֵּרוֹת, idols in the likeness of moles, a species of rodents who dig in the earth, called talpes in O.F. [taupes in modern French].
<b>and to bats</b> kalbe soric [chauvesouris in modern French]. Alternatively, this may be interpreted to mean that man will cast his idols that he made for himself, before which to prostrate himself, into pits and ditches that he finds before him when he goes to escape and hide.

### passuk 21

### passuk 22
<b>Withdraw yourselves from man</b> not to heed those who cause you to stray from following Me and to prostrate yourselves to the work of his hands.
<b>whose breath is in his nostrils</b> Whose entire life and strength are dependent upon the breath of his nostrils, which is a fleeting spirit, in him today and leaving him tomorrow. Surely the image of the moles and the bats has no substance. Another explanation is: Withdraw yourselves from all the evil ways and learn from the man who has a soul in his nostrils. Have you seen to what he is esteemed? Surely the image of his handiwork is of no esteem.
