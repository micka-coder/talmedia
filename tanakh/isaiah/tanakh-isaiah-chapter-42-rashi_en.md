<b>Behold My servant, I will support him</b> Behold My servant Jacob is not like you, for I will support him.
<b>My chosen one</b> Israel is called ‘My chosen one’ ([mss.:] His chosen one) (Ps. 135:4) “For the Eternal chose Jacob for Himself.” Scripture states also (infra 45:4): “For the sake of My servant Jacob and Israel My chosen one.”
<b>whom My soul desires; I have placed My spirit upon him</b> to let his prophets know My secret, and his end will be that ‘he shall promulgate justice to the nations,’ as it is stated (supra 2:3): “And let Him teach us of His ways etc.”

### passuk 2
<b>nor shall he raise [his voice]</b> He shall not raise his voice. It will not be necessary to admonish and to prophesy to the nations, for they will come by themselves to learn from them [i.e., from Israel], as the matter is stated (Zech. 8:23): “Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.”

### passuk 3
<b>A breaking reed he shall not break</b> Jonathan paraphrases: The meek, who are like a breaking reed, shall not break, and the poor, who are like a flickering candle, shall not be quenched.

And they shall obey them, as the matter is stated (Zeph. 3:9): “For then I will make the nations pure of speech etc.” That is what follows: And for his instruction islands shall long. They shall all obey his instruction.

### passuk 5
<b>God the Lord</b> The Master of justice and the Master of clemency.
<b>the Creator of the heavens</b> First like a sort of ball of warp thread, and afterward He stretched it out as it is stated in Tractate Hagigah (12a).

<b>Who gave a soul</b> A soul of life.
<b>to the people upon it</b> To all of them equally.

### passuk 6
<b>I called you</b> To Isaiah He says.

<b>for a light to nations</b> Every tribe is called a nation by itself, as the matter is stated (Gen. 35:11): “A nation and a congregation of nations.”

### passuk 7
<b>To open blind eyes</b> who do not see My might, to take heart to return to Me.
<b>to bring prisoners out of a dungeon</b> And because their eyes will be opened, the prisoners will come out of the dungeon. Another explanation: To inform them of the exile destined to befall them, out of which they will eventually come.

### passuk 8

<b>behold they have come to pass</b> I kept My promise, and now new things I tell My people, to promise them concerning a second exile.

### passuk 10
<b>His praise from the end of the earth</b> Perforce, when they see My mighty deeds for Israel, all the heathens (nations [Parshandatha, K’li Paz]) will admit that I am God.
<b>those who go down to the sea</b> Those who embark in ships.
<b>and those therein</b> Those whose permanent residence is in the sea and not in the islands, but in the midst of the water, they spill earth, each one of them, enough for a house, and go from house to house by boat, like the city of Venice. [As in Warsaw ed. and Parshandatha.]

### passuk 11
<b>The desert and its cities shall raise [their voice]</b> their voice in song.
<b>Kedar shall be inhabited with villages</b> (Connected to “The desert...shall raise.” The desert of Kedar, where they now dwell in tents, shall raise their voice and sing. It is like: And the villages with which Kedar is settled.) The desert of Kedar, where they now dwell in tents, will be permanent cities and villages.
<b>rock dwellers</b> The dead who will be resurrected. So did Jonathan render this.
<b>from the mountain peaks they shall shout</b> From the mountain peaks they shall raise their voices [from Jonathan].

### passuk 12

### passuk 13

### passuk 14
<b>I was silent from time immemorial</b> Already for a long time I have been silent about the destruction of My Temple, and always...
<b>I am still; I restrain Myself</b> This is present tense. Until now My spirit has constrained Me, and from now, like a travailing woman will I cry.
<b>I will be terrified</b> Heb. אֶשֹּׁם, I will be terrified.

### passuk 15

<b>I will do them</b> Heb. עֲשִׂיתִם [lit. I did them], I will do. So is the language of prophecy, to speak of the future as if it was already done.

### passuk 17

### passuk 18
<b>You deaf ones...and you blind ones</b> He is referring to Israel.

### passuk 19
<b>Who is blind</b> among you? There is no one but My servant; he is the most blind of all of you. And the most deaf among you is like My messenger whom I send to prophesy prophecies.
<b>He who was blind is as the one who received his payment</b> He who was blind among you has already received his chastisements, and he is as one who was paid all payments due him and has emerged cleansed.

### passuk 20
<b>There is much to see</b> There are many sights before you, and you do not observe to look at My deeds and to return to Me.
<b>to open the ears</b> I am busy opening your ears through My prophets, but none of you listens to My words. This is a present tense.

### passuk 21
<b>The Lord desires</b> to show you and to open your ears for His righteousness’ sake; therefore, he magnifies and strengthens the Torah for you.

### passuk 22
<b>And it</b> This people is despised and pillaged, and the end of the section is (infra v. 25) “And they laid not to heart” all of this to say, “Why did this befall me?” (v. 24) “Who subjected Jacob to plunder?”
<b>all their youths are grieved</b> Heb. הָפֵחַ בַּחוּרִים, all their youths are grieved. (Addendum: Another explanation of הָפֵח בַּחוּרִים כֻּלָם They will put themselves into snares (פַּחֵי) of the earth and into pits. [The clause,] “And they are hidden in dungeons,” proves that this is so.)
<b>and no one says, “Return.”</b> Heb. הָשַׁב, like הָשֵׁב [the imperative]. Therefore, it is not punctuated with a dagesh, but (Gen. 43:17) “That returned (הַשָּׁב) in our sacks,” is punctuated with a ‘dagesh.’

### passuk 23
<b>will hearken</b> to pay attention to this, “Who subjected Jacob to plunder?”
<b>for the future</b> Who will hearken and hear something that will stand him in good stead at the end? Jonathan, too, renders: לְסוֹפָא, at the end, and likewise, every לְאָחוֹר in Scripture refers to something that is destined to be.

### passuk 24
<b>This, that we sinned against Him</b> This is what caused the plunder and the spoiling, what we sinned against Him.
<b>and they did not want</b> Our forefathers did not want to go in His ways.

### passuk 25
<b>and it blazed upon them all around</b> I brought retribution upon the heathens ([Ms.] nations) all around so that they see and learn their lesson, like the matter stated (Zeph. 3:6f.): “I cut off nations, their towers were desolate...I said, You shall but fear Me, you shall learn a lesson...” ([This appears in certain manuscripts and in printed editions. In Nach Lublin, the reading is:] So that Israel see and learn a lesson.)
<b>and they did not know</b> They actually did know, but they trod with their heels. They did not care to understand this and to repent of their wickedness.
