### passuk 1
Thus saith the LORD to His anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him, and to loose the loins of kings; to open the doors before him, and that the gates may not be shut:

### passuk 2
I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight; I will break in pieces the doors of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron;

### passuk 3
And I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I am the LORD, who call thee by thy name, even the God of Israel.

### passuk 4
For the sake of Jacob My servant, and Israel Mine elect, I have called thee by thy name, I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known Me.

### passuk 5
I am the LORD, and there is none else, beside Me there is no God; I have girded thee, though thou hast not known Me;

### passuk 6
That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none beside Me; I am the LORD; and there is none else;

### passuk 7
I form the light, and create darkness; I make peace, and create evil; I am the LORD, that doeth all these things.

### passuk 8
Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness; let the earth open, that they may bring forth salvation, and let her cause righteousness to spring up together; I the LORD have created it.

### passuk 9
Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker, as a potsherd with the potsherds of the earth! Shall the clay say to him that fashioned it: ‘What makest thou?’ Or: ‘Thy work, it hath no hands’?

### passuk 10
Woe unto him that saith unto his father. 'Wherefore begettest thou?’ Or to a woman: ‘Wherefore travailest thou?’

### passuk 11
Thus saith the LORD, The Holy One of Israel, and his Maker: Ask Me of the things that are to come; Concerning My sons, and concerning the work of My hands, command ye Me.

### passuk 12
I, even I, have made the earth, And created man upon it; I, even My hands, have stretched out the heavens, And all their host have I commanded.

### passuk 13
I have roused him up in victory, And I make level all his ways; He shall build My city, And he shall let Mine exiles go free, Not for price nor reward, Saith the LORD of hosts.

### passuk 14
Thus saith the LORD: The labour of Egypt, and the merchandise of Ethiopia, And of the Sabeans, men of stature, Shall come over unto thee, and they shall be thine; They shall go after thee, in chains they shall come over; And they shall fall down unto thee, They shall make supplication unto thee: Surely God is in thee, and there is none else, There is no other God.

### passuk 15
Verily Thou art a God that hidest Thyself, O God of Israel, the Saviour.

### passuk 16
They shall be ashamed, yea, confounded, all of them; They shall go in confusion together that are makers of idols.

### passuk 17
O Israel, that art saved by the LORD with an everlasting salvation; Ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end.

### passuk 18
For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens, He is God; That formed the earth and made it, He established it, He created it not to be empty or chaotic, He established it to be settled and inhabited: I am the LORD, and there is none else.

### passuk 19
I have not spoken in secret, In a place of the land of darkness; I said not unto the seed of Jacob: ‘Seek ye Me in vain’; I the LORD speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.

### passuk 20
Assemble yourselves and come, draw near together, Ye that are escaped of the nations; They have no knowledge that carry the wood of their graven image, And pray unto a god that cannot save.

### passuk 21
Declare ye, and bring them near, Yea, let them take counsel together: Who hath announced this from ancient time, And declared it of old? Have not I the LORD? And there is no God else beside Me, A just God and a Saviour; There is none beside Me.

### passuk 22
Look unto Me, and be ye saved, All the ends of the earth; For I am God, and there is none else.

### passuk 23
By Myself have I sworn, The word is gone forth from My mouth in righteousness, And shall not come back, That unto Me every knee shall bow, Every tongue shall swear.

### passuk 24
Only in the LORD, shall one say of Me, is victory and strength; Even to Him shall men come in confusion, All they that were incensed against Him.

### passuk 25
In the LORD shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory.
