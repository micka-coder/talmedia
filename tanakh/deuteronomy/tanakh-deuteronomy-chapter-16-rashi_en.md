### passuk 1
<b>Take heed of the month of spring.</b> Before it arrives. Take heed that it is compatible with springtime, so that you may bring the <i>omer-mincha</i>- offering. If not, add a month to the year. 
<b>From Egypt at night.</b> But didn’t they leave by day, as it is said, “On the day after the pascal-offering, the Israelites went out, etc.”? But, because it was at night that Pharoah granted them permission to leave, as it is said, “He called for Moshe and Aharon at night, etc.” 

### passuk 2
<b>You shall slaughter the pesach-offering to Hachem your God; flocks.</b> As it is said, “You shall take it from the sheep and goats.” 
<b>And cattle.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>You shall slaughter, as the <i>chagigah</i>-offering. If those engaged as partners in the <i>pesach</i> were a large group, they must bring, with it, a <i>chagigah</i>-offering, so that it is eaten when they have filled themselves. In addition, the Rabbis derive many teachings from this passage. 

### passuk 3
<b>Bread of anguish.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Bread which memorializes the anguish they suffered in Egypt.
<b>Since in haste you left.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Without sufficient time for the dough to leaven. This will serve as a memorial. The haste was not yours, but Egypt’s, as it is said, “The Egyptians pressed the people, etc.” 
<b>So that you remember.</b> By eating the <i>pesach</i> and <i>matzah,</i> the day of your departure. 

### passuk 4
<b>None of the flesh may remain —</b> which you slaughter towards evening of the first day — until morning. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This prohibits retaining the flesh of the <i>pesach</i> offered during future generations, since this was previously stated only with regard to the <i>pesach</i> brought in Egypt. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The “first day” mentioned here refers to the fourteenth of Nisan, as it is said, “But before the first day you must remove all leaven from your homes.” <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Because Scripture has digressed from matters concerning the <i>pesach,</i> and entered a discussion of the laws of the seven days — for example, “For seven days, are you to eat on it <i>matzos</i>,” “No sourdough of yours may be seen in all of your boundary” — it is now necessary to identify the slaughter to which this admonition is directed. For, if it had written, “None of the flesh which you slaughter towards evening may remain until morning,” one might have concluded that <i>shelamim</i>-offerings slaughtered throughout the entire seven day period are included in “do not allow to remain,” and thus may be eaten for only a day and a night. Scripture, therefore, specifies “towards evening ‘of the first day.”’ Another interpretation. To the <i>chagigah</i>-offering of the fourteenth, is Scripture’s reference, teaching that it may be eaten for two days. And “the first” mentioned here is Scripture’s reference to the first day of the festival. This is the sense of the passage: ‘The flesh of the <i>chagigah</i> which you slaughter towards evening may not remain overnight during the first day of the festival until the morning of the second; however, it may be eaten on the fourteenth and fifteenth.’ This is the way it is taught in tractate Pesachim. 

### passuk 5

### passuk 6
<b>Towards evening, at sunset, at the time you left Egypt.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>These are three separate times. Towards evening — after six hours — slaughter it. At sunset — eat it. At the time you left [Egypt] — you burn it, meaning that it is disqualified as <i>nosar,</i> and must be removed to the burning site. 

### passuk 7
<b>You shall cook.</b> The reference is to roasting over an open fire. This, too, is described as cooking. 
<b>You may depart in the morning.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The morning of the second day. This teaches that one is required to remain overnight, to include the night after the festival. 

### passuk 8
<b>For six days you shall eat matzos.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Elsewhere it is said seven days. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Seven from the old crop, six from the new. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Another interpretation. This teaches that eating <i>matzoh</i> on the seventh day is not obligatory. You learn from this, and apply it to all six days; For, the seventh was included in a general group, and then isolated, with the teaching that eating <i>matzah</i> then is not obligatory, but arbitrary. It was not isolated strictly for itself, but as an example for the entire group. Just as the seventh day is arbitrary, so are all the days arbitrary, except for the first evening, which Scripture designates as obligatory, as it is said, “In the evening you shall eat matzos.” 
<b>[Is one of] withdrawal for the sake of Hachem your God.</b> Withdraw from working. Another interpretation. A gathering for celebrating with food and drink, as in “Please, let us gather you up.” 

### passuk 9
<b>From the time the sickle begins felling the standing grain.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>From the time the <i>omer</i> is cut, which begins the harvest. 

### passuk 10
<b>The fullness of your open-handed gift.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The fullness of the gift of your hand, wholly commensurate with the blessing. Bring <i>shelamim</i>-offerings of rejoicing, and invite guests for feasting. 

### passuk 11
<b>The Levite, proselyte, orphan, and widow.</b> My four correspond with your four — your son, daughter, servant, and maid-servant. If you bring joy to Mine, I shall bring joy to yours. 

### passuk 12
<b>Remember that you were a slave, etc.</b> I redeemed you with thr stipulation that you observe and fulfill these statutes. 

### passuk 13
<b>When you harvest.</b> At harvest time, when you place the summer produce in storage. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Another interpretation of when you harvest your threshing area and wine cellar. This teaches that the <i>sukkah</i> should be covered with the husks and skins left in the threshing area and wine cellar. 

### passuk 14

### passuk 15
<b>You shall experience pure joy.</b> According to its plain meaning, this is not a command, but an assurance. According to the Talmudic teaching, however, it is derived from here that <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the last evening of the festival is included in the <i>mitzvah</i> to rejoice. 

### passuk 16
<b>He shall not appear empty handed in the presence of Hachem.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Rather, bring <i>olah</i>-pilgrimage-offerings and festive <i>shelamim</i>-offerings. 

### passuk 17
<b>Everyone according to the gift appropriate to his means.</b> Someone who has numerous guests and great affluence should bring many <i>olah-</i> and <i>shelamim</i>-offerings.

<b>Judges and police officers.</b> Judges: Magistrates who render legal decisions. Police officers — who compel the people to abide by their instructions <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>by administering corporal punishment with cudgels and whips, until they accept the judge’s decision. 
<b>In all of your cities.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>In each and every city.
<b>For your tribes.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This continues from ‘You shall appoint for yourself’ — “Judges and police officers you shall appoint for yourself for your tribes, in all of your cities which Hachem, your God, is giving you.” 
<b>For your tribes.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This teaches that judges are to be seated for each and every tribe and in each and every city.
<b>Who will judge the people, etc.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Appoint competent, righteous judges, to judge righteously. 

### passuk 19
<b>Do not pervert justice.</b> This follows the obvious interpretation.
<b>Do not display favoritism.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Not even during the arguments. This prohibits the judge from being gentle with one but harsh with the other, or from requiring one to stand while the other is seated; because when one notices the judge deferring to his fellow, his arguments are repressed. 
<b>Do not accept bribery.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Even to adjudicate fairly.
<b>For bribery blinds.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Once he has accepted his bribe, it is impossible for him not to be partial, and subvert the verdict in his favor.

### passuk 21
<b>Do not plant an Asherah tree for yourself.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This makes him liable from the time that it was planted. Even if he never worshipped it, he transgresses a negative commandment for the very planting. 
Do not plant an <i>Asherah</i> tree for yourself; any tree near the altar of Hachem, your God. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This prohibits planting a tree <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>or building a structure on the Temple mount. 

### passuk 22
<b>Do not erect for yourself a monument.</b> A single-stone monument <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>for sacrificial offerings, even for the sake of Heaven. 
<b>That [God] detests.</b> An altar made of stones or <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>an earthen altar is what He commanded, but He detests this, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>because it was in the canon of the Canaanites. Although He cherished it during the times of the patriarchs, He now detests it, since they included it in the idolatrous ritual.
