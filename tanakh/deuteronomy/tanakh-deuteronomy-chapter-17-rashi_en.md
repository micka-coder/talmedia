### passuk 1
<b>Do not sacrifice, etc., anything bad.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This prohibits causing the <i>pigul</i> disqualification of the sacred offerings through a pernicious statement. Additional derivations are extrapolated from this in the tractate dealing with the slaughter of the sacred offerings. 

### passuk 2
<b>By violating His covenant.</b> Which He established with them prohibiting idolatry.

### passuk 3
<b>That I did not command.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>To worship them.

### passuk 4
<b>Authenticated.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The testimony was consistent.

### passuk 5
<b>You are to take out that man . . . to your city, etc.</b> Anyone who renders אֶל שְׁעָרֶיךָ as “to the gates of your tribunal” is mistaken, for we have learned the following: “to your gates” — this refers to the gate where he worshipped. But perhaps it refers to the gate in which he was tried? <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>”Your gates” is said below, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>and “your gates” is said above. Just as “your gates” above refers to the gate in which he worshipped, so does “your gates” below refer to the gate in which he worshipped. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Targum [Onkelos] renders “to your city.” 

### passuk 6
<b>Two witnesses or three.</b> If testimony is valid with two, why is three specified? To compare three to two. Just as two comprise a single entity, so three comprise a single entity — hence, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>none are liable as “conspiring witnesses” unless all are convicted as conspirators. 

### passuk 7

### passuk 8
<b>If . . . is too abstruse.</b> הַפְלָאָה always denotes separation, or setting apart — <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the matter is separated, concealed from you. 
<b>Between blood and blood.</b> Between ritually unclean blood and clean blood.
<b>Between decision and decision.</b> Between a ‘not guilty’ decision, and a ‘guilty’ decision. 
<b>Or between leprosy and leprosy.</b> Between ritually unclean leprosy, and clean leprosy. 
<b>Matters under dispute.</b> When the wise men of the city disagree over the matter, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>one finding that it is unclean, the other that it is clean; one ruling ‘guilty,’ the other ‘not guilty.’ 
<b>You shall rise and ascend.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This teaches that the Beis Hamikdosh was loftier than all other places.

### passuk 9
<b>The <i>kohanim</i> — the Levites —</b> The <i>kohanim,</i> who are descended from the tribe of Levi. 
<b>And the judge officiating during those days.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Even if he is not comparable to the other judges who preceded him, you must obey him — you have no one but the judge in your day. 

### passuk 10

### passuk 11
<b>Neither right or left.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Even if he tells you that right is left or left is right; certainly, if he tells you that right is right and left is left. 

### passuk 12

### passuk 13
<b>Let all the people hear.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>From here it is derived that we wait with him until the festival, then execute him during the festival. 

### passuk 14

### passuk 15

### passuk 16
<b>He may not acquire an abundance of horses for himself.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Except as required for his riding entourage, so that he does not send the people back to Egypt, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the source of supply for horses, as it is said concerning Shlomo, “Chariots were brought up out of Egypt for six hundred silver pieces, and horses for one hundred fifty.” 

### passuk 17
<b>He may not acquire an abundance of wives.</b> No more than eighteen, as we find that Dovid had six wives, and it was said to him, “If this is insufficient, then I shall add, for you, as many, and again.” 
<b>And silver and gold he may not accumulate for himself in great abundance.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Except as required to maintain his retinue.

### passuk 18
<b>It shall be, that when he occupies.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>If he fulfills this, then he is worthy of his kingdom enduring. 
<b>A duplicate of [this] Torah.</b> Two Torah scrolls, one to be stored in his treasure chamber, and one to accompany him on his arrivals and departures. Onkelos, however, translates “text,” rendering מִשְׁנֵה as “teaching,” or “word.” 

### passuk 19
<b>Every word of this Torah.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This follows the plain meaning.

### passuk 20
<b>And he does not stray from the commandment.</b> Even an easily fulfilled directive by a prophet.
<b>So that the days of his reign are lengthy.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Implicit in the positive is the negative. We find this with Shaul, whom Shmuel told, “Wait seven days, until I come to you, etc.,” to offer <i>olah</i>-sacrifices. And it is written, “He waited seven days,” but did not keep his commitment to wait the entire day. He had hardly completed the <i>olah</i>-offering, when Shmuel arrived, and told him, “You have been foolish! You have not kept. etc., so now your reign will not endure.” Thus, you learn that, over an easily fulfilled directive by a prophet, he was punished. 
<b>He and his sons.</b> This teaches that if his son qualifies as a regent, he takes precedence over all other candidates.
