That day, the Holy One, may He be blessed, granted favor to the Israelites joyfully, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>and said to Moshe, ‘I have forgiven, just as you spoke.’ This is why it was designated for atonement and forgiveness. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>From where is it derived that He granted complete favor? For it is said concerning the forty days of the last tablets, “I remained on the mountain just as during the first days.” Just as the first were with favor, so were the last with favor. You may thus say that the interim days were with anger.
