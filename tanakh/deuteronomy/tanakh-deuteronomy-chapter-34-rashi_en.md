### passuk 1
<b>From the plains of Moav to Mount Nevo.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>There were a number of elevations, but Moshe vaulted them in a single leap. 
<b>The entire land.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>He showed him all of Eretz Yisroel in its tranquility, and the oppressors who are destined to afflict it. 
<b>Till Don.</b> He showed him the idolatrous sons of Don, as it is said, “The sons of Don established for themselves the idol.” And He showed him Shimshon, who was destined to descend from him as a saviour. 

### passuk 2
<b>And all of Naftoli.</b> He showed him his territory in its tranquility and its desolation, and He showed him Devorah and Barak of Kedesh Naftoli, waging war with Sisera and his legions. 
<b>The land of Ephraim and Menasheh.</b> He showed him their territory in its tranquility and its desolation. He showed him Yehoshua waging war with the kings of Canaan — as he was descended from Ephraim, and Gideon, who was descended from Menasheh, waging war with Midian and Amalek. 
<b>And all of the land of Yehudah.</b> In its tranquility and its desolation. And He showed him the royal house of Dovid, and their triumphs. 
<b>Up until the rearward Sea.</b> The western territory, in its tranquility and its desolation. Another interpretation: Don’t read “the rearward Sea,” but “the final day.” The Holy One, Blessed is He, showed him all the events that are destined to befall Yisroel until the rejuvenation of the dead. 

### passuk 3
<b>And the Negev.</b> The southern territory. Another interpretation: The Cave of Machpelah, as it is said, “They went up at the Negev, and he proceeded until Chevron.” 
<b>And the plain.</b> He showed him Shlomo casting the vessels for the Beis Hamikdosh, as it is said, “In the plain of the Yardein the king cast them, below the surface of the ground.” 

### passuk 4
<b>Saying, ‘I will give it to your descendants’. I have shown it to you.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>So that you may go forth and say to Avrohom, Yitzchak, and Yaakov, ‘The oath which the Holy One, may He be blessed, pronounced to you has been fulfilled.’ This is [the inference of] “saying” — for this reason I have showed it to you. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>However, it has been decreed before Me that you shall not make the passage there. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Were it not for this, I would have sustained you until you would have observed them implanted and established in it, so that you could have gone forward and related this to them. 

### passuk 5
<b>Moshe died there.</b> Is it possible that Moshe died, yet he wrote “Moshe died there”? Rather, until this point Moshe wrote, beyond this point, Yehoshua wrote. R’ Meir said, ‘Is it possible that the book of the Torah was incomplete when he said, “Take this book of the Torah”? Rather, the Holy One, Blessed is He, dictated, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>while Moshe wrote with teardrops. 
<b>By the mouth of Hachem.</b> With a kiss.

### passuk 6
<b>He buried him.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The Holy One, Blessed is He, in His glory. R’ Yishmael said, he buried himself. This is one of three “him” wordings which R’ Yishmael interpreted this way. Similarly, “When the days of nazirite status are fulfilled he shall bring ‘him”’ — he brings himself. Similarly, “They burden ‘them’ with the sin of their guilt.” Can others burden them? Rather, they burden themselves. 
<b>Facing Beis Peor.</b> His grave had been readied there since the six days of creation, to atone for the incident at Peor. This was one of the objects created on the eve of Shabbos at twilight. 

### passuk 7
<b>His appearance was not dulled.</b> Even after he died.
<b>And his freshness did not fade.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>His moistness. He was not subject to decay, his countenance was not disfigured. 

### passuk 8
<b>Bnei [the sons of] Yisroel.</b> The males. But with Aharon, because he pursued peace — making peace between neighbors, between women and their husbands — it is said, “The entire house of Yisroel” — male and female. 

### passuk 9

### passuk 10
<b>Whom Hachem knew face-to-face.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>He [Moshe] had an easy familiarity with Him, and could speak with Him any time he desired, as it is said, “Now I will go up to Hachem,” “Wait, while I hear His command to you.” 

### passuk 11

### passuk 12
<b>For the entire strong hand.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>He received the Torah in the tablets with his hands.
<b>And for the entire great display.</b> The miracles and mighty deeds in the immense, awesome wilderness. 
<b>In view of all of Yisroel.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>When he took the liberty of shattering the tablets before their eyes, as it is said, “I shattered them before your eyes.” <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The Holy One, Blessed is He consented to his opinion, as it is said, “which you shattered” — ‘More power to you for shattering them!’
