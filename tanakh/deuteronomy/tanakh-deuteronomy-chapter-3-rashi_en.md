<b>I pleaded.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The word חִנוּן everywhere signifies an undeserved gift. Although the righteous might claim [reward] based on their good deeds, they ask the Almighty only for an undeserved gift. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Because [the Almighty] had said to him, “I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious,” he [Moshe] uses the expression וְאֶתְחַנַּן . <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>There is another explanation: This is one of the ten terms <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>by which prayer is described, as is stated in Sifrei.

<b>You have begun to show Your servant</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>an opportunity to stand and pray even though the decree has gone forth. He [Moshe] said to Him, “I learned this from you, for You said to me, ‘Now leave me alone.’ Was I then holding You? [But You said this] to provide an opportunity [and to show] that it was up to me to pray for them. Similarly, I thought to do so now.” 
<b>Your Greatness.</b> This refers to Your attribute of goodness. Similarly it is said, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>”And now please magnify the Might of my Master.” 
<b>And Your hand.</b> This refers to Your right hand <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>which is extended to all who enter the world.

<b>Through your fault.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>You caused this [to happen] to me. Similarly it is said, “And they provoked Him at the waters of Merivah, and Moshe suffered harm because of them.” 
<b>Enough for you.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>So that people should not say, “How harsh is the Master, and how stubborn and pleading is the disciple.” <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Another explanation of רַב לָךְ .

<b>Because he will cross.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>If he will cross at the head [of this people] they will possess [the land], but if not they will not possess it. And similarly you find that when he sent some of the people against Ai and he remained [in the camp], “The men of Ai killed [thirty-six] of them.” <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>And when he fell on his face, he [God] said to him, “Get up.” <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>It [the word קֻם ] is written [without the <i>vov</i>] [so that it can be read] קָם לָךְ — [It is because of] you remaining in your place and sending My children to war [that caused this defeat.] Why is it that you have fallen on your face?
