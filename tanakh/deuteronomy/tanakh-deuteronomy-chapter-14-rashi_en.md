### passuk 1
<b>Do not lacerate yourselves.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Do not inflict lacerations and gashes on your flesh over the dead, as is the custom among the Emorites for you are God’s children, and must therefore appear suitably becoming, rather than lacerated and hairless. 
<b>Between your eyes.</b> Near the forehead. Elsewhere it is said, “They may not tear bald spots in their heads.” This equates the entire head with the area between the eyes. 

### passuk 2
<b>For you are a sacred people.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Your own sanctity extends from your forefathers; in addition, “Hachem has chosen you.” 

### passuk 3
<b>Any abomination.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Anything I made abominable to you. For example, puncturing the ear of a first-born animal in order to slaughter it outside the Sanctuary — this is something I made abominable to you, from “There shall not be any blemish on it.” Here the Torah proceeds to teach that it is forbidden to slaughter it and then eat it on the basis of that blemish. If one cooked meat with milk — this is something I made abominable to you, so eating it is prohibited here. 

### passuk 4
<b>These are the animals . . . the gazelle, the deer, the antelope.</b> We learn that wild animals are included in the word בְּהֵמָה, “animal”; and we learn that the unclean domestic and wild animals are more numerous than the clean ones, since the less numerous are specified everywhere. 

### passuk 5
<b>The ibex.</b> Targum renders “wild goat,” “Mountain goats.” This is the <i>esteinbuc</i> [in Old French]. 
<b>And the wild ox.</b> <i>Torbala,</i> ‘ox of the forest.’ <i>Bala,</i> ‘forest’ in Aramaic. 

### passuk 6
<b>Cloven.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Split, as Targum [Onkelos] renders. 
<b>Hoof.</b> <i>Plante</i> [in Old French].
<b>Truly split.</b> Divided into two nails. Some are cloven, but not divided into nails. They are unclean. 
<b>Within the animals.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The inference is, ‘what is found within the animal, you may eat.’ From here it is derived that the fetus is permitted through the slaughter of its mother. 

### passuk 7
<b>The dromedary.</b> A creature with two humps and two spinal columns. The Rabbis remark: Why were they repeated? The animals — because of the dromedary, and the fowl — because of the <i>ra’ah,</i> which were not listed in Toras Kohanim. 

### passuk 8
<b>And do not come in contact with their carcasses.</b> The Rabbis explain that this applies during the festivals, for a man is required to purify himself during the festival. Perhaps the admonition applies throughout the year? The Torah therefore teaches, “Say to the <i>kohanim,</i> etc.” If uncleanliness emanating from a human corpse is stringent, restricting only the <i>kohanim,</i> but not the Israelites — then the lenient uncleanliness emanating from an animal carcass is — certainly. 

### passuk 9

### passuk 10

### passuk 11
<b>You may eat any pure bird.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This permits the bird released by the <i>metzora. </i>

### passuk 12
<b>This is what you may not eat.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This prohibits the slaughtered bird.

### passuk 13
<b>The ra’ah, ayah, etc.</b> The <i>ra’ah, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>ayah,</i> and <i>dayah</i> are one and the same. Why is it entitled “<i>ra’ah</i>”? Because its vision is exceedingly powerful. Why does our prohibition specify all its names? In order to refute those who would take exception; so that one does not prohibit it as “<i>ra’ah,</i>” while another permits it with the claim that its name is “<i>dayah,</i>” or its name is “<i>ayah,</i>” and it was thus never prohibited by Scripture. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>With the birds, the impure ones are specified. This teaches that the pure birds are more numerous than the impure ones. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Therefore, those less numerous are specified. 

### passuk 14

### passuk 15

### passuk 16
<b>And the <i>tinshames.</i></b> <i>Chalve soriz,</i> [in Old French]. 

### passuk 17
<b>The <i>shalach.</i></b> Which catches fish in the ocean.

### passuk 18
<b>The <i>duchifas.</i></b> This refers to the wild turkey, in Old French, <i>herupe,</i> with a double crest. 

### passuk 19
<b>Flying creeping creatures.</b> This refers to tiny insects that creep along the ground. Flies, hornets, and impure locusts, are called שֶׁרֶץ . 

### passuk 20
<b>Every ritually clean bird, you may eat.</b> But not the impure ones. This adds a positive command to the negative. Similarly with the animals: “That, you may eat” — but not impure animals. A negative command derived from a positive statement is regarded as a positive command, so that the violator transgresses a positive as well as a negative command. 

### passuk 21
<b>To the alien in your cities.</b> The resident alien, who has resolved to refrain from idolatry, but eats meat without ritual slaughter. 
<b>For you are a people sanctified to Hachem.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Sanctify yourselves by abstaining from that which is permitted. Things which are permitted, but some abstain from them as if they were prohibited; do not permit them in their presence. 
<b>Do not cook a kid.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Three times; this excludes wild animals, fowl, and impure animals. 

### passuk 22
<b>Do not cook a kid, etc. You must surely tithe.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>What is the relationship between the two subjects? The Holy One, may He be blessed, said to Yisroel, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>‘Do not cause Me to cook the young shoots of your crops while still in their mothers’ innards, for, if you do not tithe properly, just before their ripening I shall summon the east wind and batter them, as it is said, “battered before becoming standing grain.” <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Similarly, with regard to the <i>bikurim</i>-gift. 
<b>On a yearly basis.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>From here it is derived that one may not use the new crop as tithe for the old.

### passuk 23
<b>You shall eat, etc.</b> This refers to the second tithe, for we have already been taught to give the first tithe to the Levites, as it is said, “When you receive, from the Israelites, etc.” And they are permitted to eat it anywhere, as it is said, “You may eat it anywhere.” Obviously, then, this refers to a different tithe. 

### passuk 24
<b>For . . . has blessed you.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>So that the grain is too abundant to carry.

### passuk 25

### passuk 26
<b>For anything you desire.</b> This is a general statement.
<b>For cattle, flocks, wine, intoxicating liquor.</b> This is specific. 
<b>And for anything that you wish.</b> This is a return to the general. Just as the specific statement refers explicitly to <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the earth’s progeny which is suitable for human consumption, etc. 

### passuk 27
<b>And the Levite, etc., you must not abandon. </b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>By neglecting to give him the first tithe. 
<b>Since he has no portion or inheritance with you.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This excludes the gleaning, forgotten sheaves, and edge of the field gifts, and abandoned produce, since his share in them is equivalent to yours. Hence, they are exempt from tithing. 

### passuk 28
<b>At the end of three years.</b> This comes to teach that if one withheld his tithes during the first and second years of the <i>shmittah</i>-cycle, he must divest his home of them during the third year. 

### passuk 29
<b>The Levite shall come.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>And take the first tithe.
<b>And the proselyte and the orphan.</b> They take the second tithe, which belongs to the indigent this year. You are not required to eat it in Jerusalem, the way you are required to eat the second tithe during the first two years. 
<b>Let them eat their fill.</b> Give them enough to satiate them. From here we derive, “One may not give the indigent in the threshing area less than, etc.” <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>You must bring to Jerusalem the first and second year’s tithes which you withheld, and confess, ‘I have divested my home of the sacred produce’ as specified in “When you have finished tithing.”
