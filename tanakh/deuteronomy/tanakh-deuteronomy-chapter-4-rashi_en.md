<b>Do not add.</b> For instance to place five <i>parshiyos</i> in the <i>tefillin,</i> to take five species [of fruit] for the mitzvah of <i>lulav,</i> to place five fringes [instead of four on one’s garment]; and this also applies to (the command), “And do not subtract from them.”

<b>You will preserve them.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This refers to the study of the Mishnah.
<b>And you will fulfill them.</b> As literally implied.
<b>For that [displays] your wisdom and understanding, etc.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Through this you will be considered wise and understanding in the eyes of the nations.

<b>[Only] look out for yourself, etc. Lest you forget the words.</b> Then, if you do not forget them, and you fulfill them correctly <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>will you be considered wise and understanding; but if you distort them through forgetfulness, you will be considered fools.

<b>Or lest you raise your eyes [heavenward] — </b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>to speculate about the matter, and to set your heart to blunder after them. 
<b>When Hachem has made them available</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>to provide them with light. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Another explanation: [He made them available] as deities. He did not prevent them <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>from blundering after them, but paved the way for them [to err] through their meaningless speculations, in order to banish them from the world. Similarly it states: “For he smoothes [the way] before his eyes, causing Him [God] to discover his iniquity for which He will hate him. 

### passuk 20
<b>[Iron] crucible.</b> This is a vessel in which gold is refined.

### passuk 23

### passuk 24
<b>A jealous Almighty.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>He is jealous to take vengeance; In Old French — <i>emportement.</i> His anger is glowing to punish those who worship idols.

### passuk 25
<b>And have grown old.</b> He hinted to them that they would be exiled from it at the end of <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>eight hundred and fifty-two years, which is the numerical value [<i>gematria</i>] of וְנוֹשַׁנְתֶּם . But he sent them into exile earlier — at the end of eight hundred and fifty years. He exiled them two years earlier than the numerical value of וְנוֹשַׁנְתֶּם so they would not suffer the fulfillment of “that you will be completely removed [from the land].” And this is [the meaning of] what is said: “And Hachem precipitated the evil, and He brought it upon us, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>for Hachem our God is righteous.” He acted righteously [charitably צְדָקָה) with us, for He hastened to bring [the evil] two years before its time. 

### passuk 26
<b>I bring as witness against you.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>I have designated them to be witnesses that I have warned you.

### passuk 31
<b>He will not forsake you by not supporting you with His hands.</b> The expression of לֹא יַרְפְּךָ is an expression signifying that He will not cause something — <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>he will not cause you to be weakened [forsaken], for He will not separate you from Him. Similarly, “I grasped him and would not let him go,” <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the word אַרְפֶּנוּ is not vocalized אֶרְפֶֶּנוּ . The term רִפְיוֹן always refers to the causative or reflexive form — [one who forsakes others or one who causes himself to be forsaken], as for example: <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>”Leave her alone,” — let her be released. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>”Leave Me alone” — release yourself from Me. 

### passuk 32
<b>The early years.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Regarding the early years.
<b>From one end of the heavens.</b> Also inquire of all the creatures [that exist] from one end [of heaven] to the other end. This is its plain meaning; but a Midrashic explanation teaches us <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>regarding the height of Adam <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>which reached from earth to heaven, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>which is the same measurement as from one end [of the heavens] to the other end. 
<b>Did anything ever happen comparable to this great event?</b> And what is this great event? [See next verses] Did any people [ever hear], etc. 

### passuk 33

### passuk 34
<b>Did any god ever miraculously [come].</b> Has any god ever performed such miracles to come and take for himself a nation, etc. All these letters <i>hei</i> (ה) are interrogative prefixes, and are therefore vocalized with <i>chataph patach:</i> הֲנִהְיָה — Did anything ever happen. הֲנִשְׁמַע — Did anyone ever hear הֲשָׁמַע — Did any people ever hear. הֲנִסָּה — Did any god ever miraculously. 
<b>Through tests.</b> By means of tests, he made His mighty deeds known to them, for example: “Glorify yourself at my expense,” whether I will be able to do so. This is an example of a test. 
<b>With signs.</b> With signs to confirm that he [Moshe] is the messenger of the Almighty, for example, “What is that in your hand.” 
<b>With wonders.</b> These refer to the wonders that He brought upon them — the astonishing plagues.
<b>Through warfare.</b> [This refers to the episode] of the [Reed] Sea, as it is said, “For Hachem is fighting for them.” 

### passuk 35
<b>You have been shown.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The word הָרְאֵתָ according to Targum Onkelos means “You were shown.” When the Holy One, blessed is He, gave the Torah, He lay open for them the seven heavens. And just as he split [opened] the upper spheres so too did He split the lower spheres, and thus they saw that He is the only One. It is therefore stated: “You have been shown that you might know.” 

### passuk 36

### passuk 37
<b>Because He loved [your fathers].</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>And all this was because He loved [your fathers].
<b>And He took you out before Him.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Like a man who leads his son before him, as it is said, “the angel of God moved [from its position] when it traveled in front of the Israelite camp, and went behind them.” Another explanation: “And He took you out in His Presence,” in the presence of their fathers, as it is said, “In the presence of their fathers, He did wonders.” <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Do not be puzzled that it refers to them (the fathers) in the singular for it has [already] written about them in the singular, “And He chose <i>his</i> descendants after <i>him.</i>” 

### passuk 38
<b>[Stronger] than you from before you.</b> Invert [the order of the verse] and then explain it: “to expel from before you nations greater and stronger than you.”

### passuk 41
<b>Then Moshe set aside.</b> [ יַבְדִיל is the future tense.] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>He gave thought in his heart to be concerned about the matter to set them [the cities] aside. And although they would not offer asylum until those cities of Canaan were set aside, Moshe said, a <i>mitzvah</i> that I can fulfil, I will fulfil. 
<b>Across the Yardein where the sun rises.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>On that side which is on the east of Yardein.
<b>Where the sun rises</b> Because מִזְרָחָה is in the construct state, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the letter <i>reish</i> is vocalized with a <i>chataf</i> [<i>sheva</i>], [meaning] the rising of the sun — i.e., the place of the sun’s rising.

### passuk 46
