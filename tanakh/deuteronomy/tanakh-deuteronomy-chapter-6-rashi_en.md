<b>Adonoy is our God, Adonoy is one.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Adonoy who is presently our God and not the God of the nations, will in the future be [recognized] as the One God, as is said, “For then I will turn over to the peoples a pure language that they may all call upon the Name of Adonoy.” And it is said, “On that day Adonoy will be One and His name One.” 

### passuk 5
<b>You are to love.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>You are to obey His words (commands) because of your love [for Him]. There is no comparison between one who obeys out of love and one who obeys out of fear. He who obeys (serves) his master out of fear, should the master over burden him, he will leave him and go away. 
<b>With all your heart.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>With your two inclinations. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Another interpretation, “with all your heart” — your heart should not be fragmented with God. 
<b>With all your soul.</b> Even if He were to take your soul.
<b>And with all your possesions.</b> With all your wealth. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>There are men whose wealth is dearer to them than their bodies. It is therefore said, “With all your possessions.” <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Another interpretation, “With what ever measure” — with what ever measure He apportions you, whether it is a measure of goodness or a measure of punishment (you must love Him). Similarly did Dovid say: “the cup of deliverance I will raise [and upon the Name, Adonoy, I will call]. “Trouble and sorrow I encounter, [and upon the Name, Adonoy, I call].” 

### passuk 6
<b>And these words.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>What is the form of love [you are commanded]? “These words [that I command you today, etc.]” For in this manner you be aware of the Holy One blessed is He, and You will cling to His ways. 
<b>That I command you today.</b> [These words] shall not be in your eyes like an outdated decree <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>which no one takes seriously, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>but rather like a newly given one, which is read eagerly by all. [The word] דְיוֹטַגְמָא [implies] a royal command in written form. 

### passuk 7
<b>And you shall teach them.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The word שִׁנַנְתָּם is an expression of sharpness, implying that they (words of Torah) should be sharp in your mouth, so that if a person asks you anything about them, you will not need to stammer (hesitate) about it, but tell him (the answer) immediately. 
<b>To your children.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>[In this instance בָנֶיךָ ] refers to the disciples (students). We find everywhere that disciples are referred to as children, as it is said, “You are children of Adonoy, your God,” and it says, “the children (disciples) of the prophets who were in Beis Eil.” Similarly in reference to King Chizkiyahu who taught the Torah to all of Yisroel, and he called them children, as it is said, “My children, now, do not be carelessely forgetful.” And even as disciples are called children as it is said, “You are children of Adonoy, your God, so too is the <i>Rav</i> (teacher) called father, as it is said, “My father, my father, the chariot of Yisroel, etc.” 
<b>And you are to discuss them.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Your main discussions should be only about them. Make them (words of Torah) primary and do not make them of secondary importance.
<b>When you go to sleep.</b> I might conclude that this means even if you go to sleep in midday, it is therefore stated, “When you arise.” I might then conclude that this means even if you arise in midnight, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>it is therefore stated, “When you sit at home and when you walk on the road”; thus the Torah speaks of the usual way of life, [indicating that בְּשָׁכְבְךָ means] the usual time of sleeping [and בְקוּמֶךָ means] the usual time of rising. 

### passuk 8
<b>And you are to tie them as a sign upon your arm.</b> These are the <i>tefillin</i> that are placed on the arm.
<b>And they are to be totafos between your eyes.</b> These are the <i>tefillin</i> that are placed on the head. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>It is due to the number of Scriptural sections [contained in them] that they are called <i>totafos,</i> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>for טֹט in Coptic language means two, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>and פֹת in the African language means two. 

### passuk 9
<b>The doorposts of your house.</b> The word מְזֻזוֹת is written defectively to indicate that only <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>one is necessary [for each door.]
<b>And on your gateposts.</b> [The plural is used] to include the gates of courtyards, the gates of provinces and the gates of cities. 

### passuk 10

### passuk 11
<b>Hewn cisterns.</b> since it [Eretz Yisroel] is a place of stones and cliffs, the word חַצִיבָה, hewn, is an appropriate term here. 

### passuk 12
<b>From the house of slavery.</b> As the Targum explains: “From the house of slavery,” <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>from the place where you were slaves. 

### passuk 13
<b>And swear by His Name.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>If you possess all these qualities: You fear His Name and you serve Him, then you may swear by His Name; for since you fear His Name you will be prudent with your oath, otherwise you should not swear. 

### passuk 14
<b>From the gods of the peoples around you.</b> This laws also applies to those that are far away, but since you observe how those around you go astray after them, the need to warn you against them was of greater necessity. 

### passuk 15

### passuk 16
<b>At Massoh.</b> When they went out of Egypt, it was there that they tested Him regarding water, as it is said, “Is Adonoy among us (or not).” 

### passuk 17

### passuk 18
<b>The upright and the good.</b> This refers to compromises beyond what is outlined by the law.

### passuk 19
<b>As (Adonoy) declared.</b> And where did He so declare? “And I will bring panic to all the people, etc.” 

### passuk 20
<b>When your son asks you tomorrow.</b> The word מָחָר (tomorrow) is used sometimes in reference to a distant future.
