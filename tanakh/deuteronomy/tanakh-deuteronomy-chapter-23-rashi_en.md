### passuk 1
<b>A man may not marry.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>He cannot effect marriage with her — marriage with her is legally invalid.
<b>And may not expose the edge of his father’s garment.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>His father’s prospective levirate partner, appropriate for his father. But he was already warned concerning her, from “the nakedness of your father’s brother.” <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Evidently, to transgress, with her, against two prohibitions, and to place, next to her, “the bastard may not enter,” <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>to teach that the bastard is only [someone born] of those liable to <i>kares</i> excision; certainly judicial execution, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>as no act of incest or adultery subject to judicial execution is exempt from <i>kares</i> excision. 

### passuk 2
<b>With injured or crushed.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Whose testicles were injured or crushed.
<b>Or with a gash causing spilling.</b> The organ was gashed, and no longer ejects a stream of semen, but spills and dribbles, and is sterile. 

### passuk 3
<b>A base-born may not enter into Hachem’s community.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>He may not marry an Israelite woman.

### passuk 4
<b>An Ammonite may not enter.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>He may not marry an Israelite woman.

### passuk 5
<b>Because of the matter.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Because of their advice concerning you, to incite you to sin [as written in the affair of Bilam]. 
<b>On the way.</b> When you were harried.

### passuk 6

### passuk 7
<b>Do not pursue their peace.</b> By inference from what is said, “He may remain with you, in your midst,” <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>perhaps this one as well? The Torah therefore teaches, “Do not pursue their peace.” 

### passuk 8
<b>Do not despise the Edomite.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Completely, although it would be appropriate for you to despise him, as he advanced towards you with the sword. 
<b>Do not despise the Egyptian.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Totally, although they hurled your males into the river. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>What is the reason? Because they received you hospitably during a time of need. Therefore: 

### passuk 9
<b>Children who will be born to them in the third generation, etc.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The other nations, however, are permitted immediately. Thus we learn that <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>someone who incites a man to sin is worse than someone who murders him. For the one who murders him, murders him in this world, while the one who incites him to sin, drives him out of this world and the World to Come. Therefore, Edom, who advanced towards them with the sword, is not to be despised. Similarly Egypt, which drowned them. These, however, who incited them to sin, are despicable. 

### passuk 10
<b>When you go out . . . take precautions.</b> As Satan incriminates in times of peril.

### passuk 11
<b>A nocturnal incident.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Scriptural law is expressed in common circumstances.
<b>He must go out of the camp.</b> This is a positive commandment.
<b>He may not enter into the midst of the camp.</b> This is a negative commandment. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>He is not permitted to enter the camp of the Levites, certainly not the camp of the <i>Shechinah.</i> 

### passuk 12
<b>As sunset nears.</b> Close to the setting of the sun, he should immerse himself, as <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>he does not become pure without the setting of the sun. 

### passuk 13
<b>Have a designated place.</b> As Targum [Onkelos] renders, similar to “everyone at his place.” 
<b>Outside the camp.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Outside the cloud.

### passuk 14
<b>In addition to your weapons.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Aside from your other utensils.
<b>Your weapons.</b> Similar to “your instruments of force.”

### passuk 15
<b>Let Him not see within you.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>[Let] the Holy One, Blessed is He [not see] disgraceful objects. 

### passuk 16
<b>Do not deliver a slave.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>As Targum [Onkelos] renders. Another interpretation: Even a Gentile slave owned by a Jew, who fled from outside the land to Eretz Yisroel. 

### passuk 17

### passuk 18
<b>There shall not be a harlot.</b> Promiscuous, dedicated to and designated for lecherous relations. 
<b>And there shall not be a male prostitute.</b> Designated for homosexual relations. Onkelos renders, ‘An Israelite woman shall not be kept by a slave,’ <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>for she, too, engages promiscuously in lecherous intimate relations, since his marriage is ineffective with her, as they are compared to the donkey, as it is said, “Remain here with the donkey” — a people compared to the donkey. ‘And an Israelite man shall not marry a maid servant,’ for he, too, becomes a male prostitute through her, since all of their intimate relations amount to lechery, as his marriage is ineffective with her. 

### passuk 19
<b>A harlot’s fee.</b> [If] he gave her a lamb as her harlot’s fee, it is disqualified as a sacrificial offering. 
<b>Or payment for a dog.</b> If he exchanged a sheep for a dog.
<b>Even both.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This adds alterations in form, as, for example, wheat kernels ground into flour. 

### passuk 20
<b>You may not pay usury.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This prohibits the borrower from paying interest to the lender. [Afterward, the prohibition to the lender: ‘You may not lend him your money for usury.’] 

### passuk 21
<b>You may pay usury to the stranger.</b> But not to your brother. A negative commandment deduced from the positive constitutes a positive commandment — <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>so that he transgresses, for this, two negative commandments and one positive commandment. 

### passuk 22
<b>Do not delay in discharging it.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>For three festivals. The Rabbis derive this from Scripture.

### passuk 23

### passuk 24
<b>Keep what you have articulated and perform.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This specifies a positive commandment with the negative.

### passuk 25
<b>When you enter your fellow’s vineyard.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Scripture refers to a laborer.
<b>As you desire.</b> As much as you desire.
<b>To your satisfaction.</b> But not to gorge yourself.
<b>But you may not place it in your container.</b> From here [we derive] that the Torah refers only to harvest time, when you place it into the owner’s receptacle. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>However, if he enters to till or to hoe, he may not eat. 

### passuk 26
<b>When you enter your fellow’s standing grainstalks.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>With this, as well, Scripture refers to the laborer.
