### passuk 1
<b>Everything.</b> The less significant as well as the greatly consequential.
<b>Be careful to fulfill.</b> This adds a negative command to the positive commands stated in this chapter, as “be careful” always denotes a negative command, except that one is not punished with lashes for violating “be careful” when it is added to a positive command. 
<b>Do not add to it.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Five <i>totafos</i> with the <i>tefilin,</i> five species with the <i>lulav,</i> four benedictions with the priestly benediction. 

### passuk 2
<b>And he gives you an omen.</b> In the heavens, as it is said with Gideon, “Produce an omen for me,” and it is said, “Please, let the fleece be dry, etc.” 
<b>Or a miracle.</b> On earth. In spite of this, pay no heed to him. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>And should you ask, ‘Why has the Holy One, may He be blessed, empowered him to produce an omen’? “For Hachem your God is testing you.” 

### passuk 3

### passuk 4

### passuk 5
<b>Keep his commandments.</b> The Torah given through Moshe.
<b>Heed his voice.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The voice of the prophets.
<b>Serve Him.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>In his Sanctuary.
<b>Cleave to Him.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Embrace His ways; engage in kindness, bury the dead, and visit the sick, just as the Holy One, may He be blessed, did. 

### passuk 6
<b>A fabrication.</b> Something cast out of the universe, non-existent, never created. I never told him to say it. <i>Destolude,</i> “perverted” in Old French. 
<b>And redeemed you from the house of bondage.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Even if He had done nothing for you but redeemed you, this is sufficient. 

### passuk 7
<b>If . . . should incite you.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The word הֲסָתָה always denotes inciting, as it is said, “If Hachem has incited you against me.” <i>Ametra,</i> “seduce” in Old French. He seduces him into performing the act. 
<b>Your brother.</b> Paternally, or — 
<b>Your mother’s son.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Maternally.
<b>Your bosom.</b> Who reclines in your bosom, and is wrapped up with you. <i>Afichiede</i> in Old French. Similarly, “And from the area wrapped in the earth” — from the foundation embedded in the earth. 
<b>Who is your soul mate.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This refers to your father. Scripture specifies those whom you cherish — certainly with others.
<b>Clandestinely.</b> Scripture depicts ordinary circumstances. The seducer will ordinarily only deliver his message clandestinely. Similarly, Solomon says, “In the evening, when day has darkened into night, in the black of night and murkiness.” 
<b>Whom you never knew, neither you nor your forefathers.</b> This is something extremely degrading to you, for even the Gentile nations do not abandon their forefathers’ tradition; yet, he tells you ‘Abandon your forefathers’ tradition’! 

### passuk 8
<b>Who are near you or at a distance.</b> Why specify “near” and “distant”? Rather, Scripture states the following: By the nature of those nearby, you may learn the nature of those at distance. Just as those nearby are empty of substance, so are those distant insubstantial. 
<b>From the ends of the earth.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This refers to the sun, the moon, and the heavenly hosts, which traverse the world from end to end. 

### passuk 9
<b>Do not be favorably inclined towards him.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Do not be inclined towards him, do not love him. Because it is said, “Love your fellow as yourself” — here, do not love him. 
<b>Do not listen to him.</b> When he begs for his life, for forgiveness. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Because it is said, “Lay aside [your hatred of him] and assist him” — here, do not lay aside [your hatred]. 
<b>Do not view him compassionately.</b> Because it is said, “Do not stand by at the spilling of your brother’s blood” — here, have no compassion. 
<b>Do not take pity.</b> Do not extend yourself to exonerate him.
<b>Do not cover for him.</b> If you have incriminating information, you are not permitted to keep silent. 

### passuk 10
<b>For you must surely execute him.</b> If the court found him innocent, retry him to incriminate him; but if the court found him guilty, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>do not retry him to exonerate him. 
<b>Let your hand strike him first.</b> It is a <i>mitzvah</i> for the object of his seduction to execute him. If he did not succeed in killing him, then others must perform the execution, as it is said, “The hand of all the people, etc.” 

### passuk 11

### passuk 12

### passuk 13
<b>In which to settle.</b> This excludes Jerusalem, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>which was not given as a dwelling place. 
<b>If you hear, etc., saying.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Saying the following: 

### passuk 14
<b>Men have gone out</b> — unscrupulous. Without a yoke, as they have cast off the yoke of Heaven. 
<b>Men.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>But not women.
<b>The inhabitants of their city.</b> But not the inhabitants of another city. From here it is derived that an apostate city cannot be so designated unless suborned by men, and by its own constituents. 

### passuk 15
<b>You must investigate, inquire, and interrogate thoroughly.</b> From here it is derived that there are seven inquiries, from the added passages. Here there are three: “investigation,” “inquiry,” and “thoroughness.” “Interrogate” is not counted, since the examining interrogation is derived from there. Elsewhere, it is said, “The magistrates must investigate thoroughly.” Still elsewhere, it is said, “You must investigate thoroughly.” <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>”Thoroughly” and “Thoroughly” are extrapolated by the principle of textual comparison, so that the Torah’s specifications with each may be applied to the other. 

### passuk 16
<b>You must surely strike down.</b> If you are unable to execute them by the method specified by Scripture for them, execute them by another method. 

### passuk 17
<b>For Hachem your God.</b> For His Name and for His sake.

### passuk 18
<b>So that Hachem withdraws His raising fury.</b> For, so long as idolatry exists in the world, fury rages in the world.
