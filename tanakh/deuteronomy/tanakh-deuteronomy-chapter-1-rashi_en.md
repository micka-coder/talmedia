<b>These are the words.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Because these are words of admonishment, and [because] he [Moshe] intended to recount here all the places where they [the Israelites] angered the Almighty, he therefore said these words in an obscure manner <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>and only intimated [that they sinned in these places] to uphold the honor of Israel. 
<b>To all of Yisroel.</b> Had he admonished [only] some of them, those that were in the market place could have said, “You heard what the son of Amram said [about us] and did not refute him about anything; had we been there we would have refuted [his charges].” Therefore, he gathered all of them, and said to them, “You are all present here, he who can refute [me], let him refute [me]. 
<b>In the wilderness.</b> They were not in the wilderness but in the plains of Moav. What then is the meaning of בַּמִּדְבָּר ? It is mentioned here because <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>they had angered God in the wilderness when they said “If only we had died [by the hand of Adonoy,] etc.” 
<b>In the Arava plain.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Because it was at Arava that they had sinned through Baal Peor at Shittim in the plains of Moav.
<b>Facing Suf.</b> Because they had rebelled at the Reed Sea — when they came to the Reed Sea, they said “were there not enough graves in Egypt.” And similarly when they went up from the midst of the sea, as it is said, “But they rebelled at the Sea, at the Sea of Reeds,” as it is taught in Maseches Eruchin. 
<b>Between Poron and Tofel and Lovon.</b> R. Shimon ben Yochai said, “We reviewed the entire Scripture and we found no place with the name Tofel or Lovon. Rather he admonished them [with these words] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>regarding the denigrating statements they made (<i>Tofel</i>) about the Manna which is white (<i>Lovon</i>), when they said, “Our soul detests this light bread.” [The word <i>Poron</i> implies] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the sin they committed in the wilderness of <i>Poron</i> because of the spies. 
<b>And Chatzeiros.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This refers to the rebellion of Korach. Another explanation — He said to them, “You should have learned [a lesson] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>from what I did to Miriam at Chatzeiros because of the slander she spoke, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>and nevertheless you spoke against the Almighty. 
<b>And Di Zohov.</b> He admonished them about the [golden] calf they made because of the abundance of gold they had [accumulated], as it is said, “I gave them silver and gold in abundance, they made it into a <i>Baal</i> [an idol].” 

### passuk 2
<b>Eleven days [travelling time] from Choreiv.</b> Moshe said to them, “See what you brought on yourselves, there is no shorter route from Choreiv to Kadeish Barnea than by way of Mount Seir, and even that is a journey of eleven days; and [yet] you covered the distance in three days.” For you travelled from Choreiv on the twentieth of Iyar, as it is said, “In the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month [the cloud went up and the Bnei Yisroel journeyed out of the wilderness of Sinai, Choreiv], and on the twenty-ninth day of Sivan they sent the spies from Kodeish-Barnea. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Deduct from these days the thirty days they lived in Kivros haTaavah where they ate the meat for a month of days; [and deduct] the seven days they camped at Chatzeiros waiting for Miriam who was closed up there; thus we find that in three days, they travelled that entire route. To this extent <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the <i>Shechina</i> attempted for your good to hasten your coming to the Land, but because of your misconduct, He made you <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>circle around Mount Seir for forty years. 

### passuk 3
<b>[Beginning] in the fortieth year in the eleventh month, on the first of the month.</b> This teaches that he admonished them <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>only shortly before his death. From whom did he learn this? From Yaakov — For Yaakov admonished his sons only shortly before his death. He said, “Reuvein, my son, I will tell you why I did not admonish you during all these years; because I did not want you to desert me and go to join my brother Eisov.” There are four reasons why one would not admonish a person until shortly before one’s death: 1) <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>so that he does not admonish him again and again, 2) <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>so that his fellow not be ashamed when he sees him, etc., as it is taught in Sifre. Similarly, Yehoshua admonished the Bnei Yisroel only shortly before his death, and so Shmuel, as it is said, “Behold testify against me,” and so Dovid admonished his son Shlomo, [shortly before his death.] 

### passuk 4
<b>After he had smitten [Sichon].</b> Moshe said, “If <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>I admonish them before they come into [at least] part of the land, they could say, “What claim does he have on us? What good has he done for us? He has come only to harass us and <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>to find an excuse [for leaving us in the wilderness], for he has no power to bring us into the land.” Therefore he waited until he crushed Sichon and Og before them and had given them possession of their land, and then he admonished them. 
<b>Sichon, [King of the Emorites] who was living in Cheshbon.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Even if Sichon was not a formidable opponent but had lived in Cheshbon, it would have been difficult [to defeat him] because the city itself was formidable; and if it would have been another city and Sichon had lived there, it would have been difficult [to defeat him] because the King [Sichon] was a formidable opponent. How much more [difficult was the situation] when both King and city were formidable [opponents.] 
<b>[Og] who was living in Ashtoros, in Edrei.</b> [Here too] the King and the city were formidable [opponents.] 
<b>Ashtoros.</b> This is an expression denoting cliffs and ruggedness of terrain <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>similar to Ashteros Karnayim, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>and this Ashtoros is indeed the same Ashteros Karnayim where the Rephaim were when Amrofel smote them, as it is said, “and they defeated the Rephaim in Ashteros Karnayim.” Og was the only one who escaped from them, and he is referred to in the verse as it is said, “the one who escaped came [and told Avram], and it is stated, “Only Og, King of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim.” 
<b>In Edrei.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This was the name of the empire.

### passuk 5
<b>[Moshe] began.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>[The word הוֹאִיל means] he began; just as it is [said,] “Here I have begun [to speak].” 
<b>To elucidate this Torah.</b> He explained it to them <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>in seventy languages.

### passuk 6
<b>Enough of your living [at this mountain].</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>According to its plain meaning [it refers to the extended length of time]; <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>but there is an Aggadic interpretation: You have received much fame and reward as a result of your having dwelt on this mountain — you constructed the <i>Mishkan,</i> the <i>Menorah</i> and [various other sacred] articles, you received the Torah, you appointed a <i>Sanhedrin</i> for yourselves, officers in charge of hundreds and officers of thousands. 

### passuk 7
<b>Turn and Travel for yourselves.</b> This was the route through Arad and Chormah.
<b>And arrive at the Emorite hill [region].</b> Understand this literally.
<b>And at all its neighbors.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This refers to Ammon, and Moav, and Mount Seir. 
<b>On the plain.</b> This refers to plain of the forest.
<b>On the mountain.</b> The King’s mountain.
<b>And in the low land.</b> This refers to the low land of the south[ern region].
<b>And in the Negev, and on the seacoast.</b> Ashkelon, Gaza, and Caesarea, etc. as is stated in Siphrei. 
<b>Up to the great River [the Euphrates].</b> Because it is mentioned in connection to Eretz Yisroel, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>it is referred to as great. There is a proverb that says, The servant of the King is a King; <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>attach yourself to the chief and people will bow to you; <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>become close to one who is anointed [distinguished] and you become anointed. 

### passuk 8
<b>See I have set.</b> You see this with your own eyes. I am not saying this to you based on guesswork or rumor.
<b>Come and inherit [the land].</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>No one will contest this matter, and you will not need to go to war. Had they not sent spies, they would have had no need for weapons. 
<b>To your forefathers.</b> What need was there to mention [them by Name] Avrohom, Yitzchok and Yaakov? [To teach that the merit of] Avrohom alone was sufficient, [the merit of] Yitzchok alone was sufficient, [the merit of] of Yaakov alone was sufficient. 

### passuk 9
<b>I said to you at that time saying.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>What is the significance of לֵאמֹר in this context? Moshe said to them, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>”I am not telling you this on my own initiative, but at the behest of the Holy One, blessed is He.” 
<b>I cannot [carry you] by myself.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Is it possible that Moshe was unable to judge [Bnei] Yisroel? The man who brought them out of Egypt, who split the sea for them, who caused the Manna to fall, who piled up the quails, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>was unable to judge them? However, this is what he said to them, “Adonoy, your God, has <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>multiplied you, i.e., he has made you great and has uplifted you over your judges; He has removed the penalty from you <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>and set it upon judges. Shlomo intimated the same thing when he said, “For who is able to judge this difficult people of Yours.” Is it possible that he of whom it is written, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>”He is the wisest of all men,” should say, “Who is able to judge, etc.”; but this is actually what Shlomo said [meant], the judges of this people are not like the judges of the nations of the world, for when they [wrongly] judge a person, send to death, or whipping, or strangulation, or if they pervert his justice and rob him, it is not considered a serious matter, but if I wrongly sentence a person to pay money I am liable for my very life, as it is said, “And He robs the life of those who rob them.” 

### passuk 10
<b>And you are today like the stars in the sky.</b> Were they really numerous as the stars that day? They actually numbered only six hundred thousand [at the time]. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>What then does “<i>you are today</i>” mean? You are compared to the day, you are as eternal <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>as the sun, the moon and the stars. 

### passuk 11
<b>[He] will add to you one thousandfold.</b> What is the significance of the additional words: <b>And will bless you as He spoke about you?</b> They [Bnei Yisroel] said to Moshe, “You are limiting our blessing, the Holy One blessed is He, has already assured Avrohom, “[I will make your descendants as the dust of the earth] so that if a man can count, etc.” <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>[Moshe then] said to them, “This [one thousandfold blessing] is my personal blessing, but He will bless you “As He spoke about you.” 

### passuk 12
<b>How can I carry alone.</b> If I would say, [“I will do so] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>in order to be rewarded,” I cannot do so. This is what I have [already] told you, “I did not say this to you on my own accord but by the order of the Holy One Blessed is He.” 
<b>Your troublesomeness.</b> This teaches us that Bnei Yisroel were troublesome. If one of them would see that his rival was about to win the Din Torah, he would say, “I have [additional] witnesses to bring, I have [more] proof to bring, I want to add additional judges over you.” 
<b>Your burdensomeness.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This teaches that they were scoffers. When Moshe left his tent early [in the morning], they would say, “Why does the son of Amram leave so early? Perhaps things are not calm in his house”? When he left late, they would say, “For what reason is the son of Amram not leaving? What do you think [is the reason]? He is sitting and planning evil schemes against you, and is thinking up plots [against you].” 
<b>Contentiousness.</b> This teaches that they were discontented.

### passuk 13
<b>Provide yourselves [men]</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Prepare yourselves to fulfil this matter.
<b>Men.</b> Would you think [that he expected them to take] women [as leaders]? Why then was it necessary to stipulate “men”? [To emphasize that they should be] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>righteous men, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Men who are desired. Wise men.
<b>Understanding.</b> Men who are able to deduce one matter on the basis of another matter. This is what Arius asked R’ Yosi, “What is the difference between wise men and understanding men”? A wise man is like a wealthy currency dealer, when people bring him <i>dinarim</i> to evaluate, he evaluates them; and when they do not bring to him, he sits and is idle. An understanding man is like a commercial trader, when they bring him coins to evaluate, he evaluates them; and when they do not bring to him, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>he goes about to bring his own. 
<b>And renowned to your tribes.</b> those that are known to you, for if he would come before me <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>enwrapped in his <i>talis,</i> I would not know who he is, and from which tribe he comes, and if he is qualified; but you know him, for you have raised him. Therefore it is said, “And renowned to your tribes.” 
<b>Leaders over you.</b> Leaders and men of honor over you, that you will conduct yourselves with them with respect and reverence. 
<b>And designated them.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The word אַשִׂמֵם lacks the letter <i>yud</i> (our <i>sifrei Torah</i> however have the <i>yud</i> in place). This teaches that the guilt of Bnei Yisroel is placed on the heads of their judges (leaders) for it is their duty to admonish and direct them onto the right path.

### passuk 14
<b>And you answered me [and said].</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>You answered with determination to your benefit. You should have replied, “Moshe, our teacher, from whom is it more fitting to learn, from you or from your disciple? Would it not be better [to learn] from you who <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>suffered for it?” But I knew your thoughts when you said, now many judges will be appointed over us, if he is not of our acquaintance, we will bring him a present (bribe), and he will deal favorably with us. 
<b>To do.</b> [Even] if I had been sluggish [in doing so], you [would have] said “Do it quickly.” 

### passuk 15
<b>I took the leaders of your tribes.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>I persuaded them with words: Fortunate are you! Over whom are you to be appointed? Over the children of Avrohom, Yitzchok and Yaakov, over those who are called [by the Almighty] [His] bretheren, friends, [His] portion, inheritance, and by every expression of affection. 
<b>Men wise and renowned.</b> But men of understanding I did not find. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This qualification was one of the seven requirements which Yisro outlined to Moshe. [Moshe] found only three of them: righteous men, wise men, and men of renown. 
<b>Leaders over You.</b> You must show them respect: [they must be given] first to buy, first chance to sell, first chance in business dealings; <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>he is to enter [the Synagogue or Bais Hamidrash] last and he is to be first to leave. 
<b>Masters of thousands.</b> One who is appointed [to govern] over one thousand.
<b>Master of hundreds.</b> One who is appointed [to govern] over one hundered.
<b>Court-officers.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>I appointed court-officers for your tribes. These jail and flog the offender by order of judges.

### passuk 16
<b>I commanded your judges.</b> I said to them, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>”Act with patience in judging. If certain litigation is brought before you once, twice and three times, do not say ‘this litigation has already been before me many times,’ but deliberate the case thoroughly.” 
<b>At that time.</b> When I appointed them, I said to them, “The situation now is no longer as it was. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>In the past you were on your own, [but] now you are obligated to the community.” 
<b>Listen.</b> שָׁמֹעַ is a grammatical form denoting present active, <i>odant</i> in Old French, similar to זָכוֹר remember, and שָׁמוֹר preserve. 
<b>And between his complainant.</b> This refers to his complainant in a litigation <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>who accumulates words against him. Another explanation — between his co-dweller — even refers to a dispute concerning a dwelling such as the division of a house between brothers, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>even [a dispute] about an oven and a range. 

### passuk 17
<b>Do not show favor in judgement.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This [command is addressed] to the one who appoints judges, he should not say, “This person is handsome or powerful, I will appoint him to be a judge; this person is my relative, I will appoint him to be a judge in the city,” and since this person is not an expert in the laws, consequently, he will convict the innocent, and acquit the guilty. I will consider it against the one who appointed him as though he showed favor in judgement. 
<b>Small and great alike will you hear out.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Litigation involving a <i>peruta</i> should be as dear to you as litigation involving a hundred <i>maneh,</i> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>so if a [minor litigation] comes before you first, do not push it off until the last. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Another explanation: Small and great alike will you hear out, can be explained as the <i>Targum Onkelos</i> has it: [hear out the words of the small as well as the great person,] i.e., he should not say, “This one is a poor man, and his friend [opponent] is a rich man and since he is commanded to support him, I will rule in favor of the poor man and thus he will be supported in a tidy manner.” Another explanation: He should not say, “How can I offend the dignity of this rich man because of one <i>dinar?</i> I will rule in his favor for the moment, and when he goes outside [the court] I will say to him ‘give it back to him because you [really] owe it to him.”’ 
<b>Do not fear any man.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Do not be afraid. Another explanation of לֹא תָגוּרוּ : <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Do not gather in [suppress] your words because of man. תָגוּרוּ is an expression similar to אוֹגֵר בְּקַיִץ — Gathering in the summer.
<b>For justice belongs to God.</b> Whatever you take from this man unjustly, you force Me to restore to him. The result being <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>that you diverted the judgement upon Me. 
<b>Present to me.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Because of this [statement] the law eluded him regarding the daughters of Tselofchod. Similarly, when Shmuel said to Shaul, “I am the Seer [prophet],” the Holy One Blessed is He said to him, “By your life! I will inform you that you are not a Seer [prophet].” When did He inform him? When he (Shmuel) came to anoint Dovid [it is written] “And when he saw Eliav, he said, ‘Surely before Adonoy stands His anointed.’ The Holy One blessed is He, said to him (Shmuel), “Did you not say ‘I am the Seer,’ do not look at the physical appearance.” 

### passuk 18
<b>All the things that you are to do.</b> This refers to the ten things that differentiate <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>between monetary litigations and capital litigations.

### passuk 19
<b>The Great and awesome wilderness.</b> [It is so called] because <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>in there were snakes thick as beams and scorpions large as bows.

### passuk 20

### passuk 21

### passuk 22
<b>You approached me, all of You.</b> [All of you together] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>in a hodgepodge. But later, he [Moshe] said, “You approached me, all the leaders of your tribes and your elders, and you said, ‘Look, etc.”’ that approach was proper — the young people showed respect for the elders, letting them them go ahead of them, and the elders showed respect for the leaders, letting them go ahead of them; but here you approached me, all of you, in a hodgepodge — the young pushing aside the elders, and the elders pushing aside the leaders. 
<b>And let them bring back word to us.</b> Let them tell us <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>what language they speak.
<b>The route we are to go up on.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>There is no road in which there are no winding curves.
<b>And the cities we will be coming to.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>[Which cities] will we have to capture first.

### passuk 23
<b>The idea pleased me.</b> In my eyes [the idea was good] but not in the eyes of the Almighty. If the idea pleased Moshe, why did he mention it among his admonishments? [This can be explained with a] parable. A man says to his fellow, “Sell this donkey of yours to me.” He says, “yes [I will sell it to you].” “Will you give it to me on a trial basis”? He answers, “Yes.” “May I try it out on hills and mountains”? He answers, “Yes.” Since he [the buyer] saw that the seller placed no restrictions [on the sale], the buyer says to himself, “This man is confident that I will find no defect in it.” He then immediately says to him, “Take your money — I need not test it.” [Here too, Moshe said], “I too consented to your words, [thinking] perhaps you would change your minds [when you saw that I did not object, but you did not change your minds.”] 
<b>I took from you.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>From the choicest among you, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>from the finest among you. 
<b>Twelve men, one man per tribe.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This tells us that the tribe of Levi was not among them. 

### passuk 24
<b>[They arrived] at Wadi Eshkol.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This tells us that it was called [Eshkol] because of the incident that was to happen there.
<b>And they spied it out.</b> This teaches that they passed through it <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>along four lines — through its length and breadth.

### passuk 25
<b>And brought down to us.</b> This tells us Eretz Yisroel is higher than all other lands.
<b>And they said, “Good is the land.”</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Who were they that said [the land was] good? Yehoshua and Caleiv. 

### passuk 26
<b>And You defied.</b> וַתַּמְרוּ is an expression of defiance. You defied His word.

### passuk 27
<b>You grumbled.</b> You spoke slanderous words. This is similar to “the words of a נִרְגָן,” i.e., a man who slanders. 
<b>Because of Adonoy’s hatred of us.</b> In reality, He loved you, but you hated Him. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>A popular proverb says, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>”What is in your heart regarding your friend, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>[you imagine] is in his heart regarding yourself.” 
<b>Because of Adonoy’s hatred of us, He took us out of the land of Egypt.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>His taking us out was an act of hatred. This may be compared to a human King who had two sons and two fields, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>one of which was well-watered, and the other was dry. To the son he loves he gives the well-watered field, and to the son he hates he gives the dry field. The land of Egypt is a well-watered land, for the Nile river rises and irrigates it, and the land of Canaan is a dry land — and He took us out of Egypt in order to give us the land of Canaan. 

### passuk 28
<b>Cities great and fortified sky-high.</b> Scriptual texts [at times] speak in <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>exaggerated terms.

### passuk 29
<b>Do not crumble.</b> תַעַרְצוּן is an expression of breaking; as the Targum [translates it]; and it is similar to “To abide in עָרוּץ נְחָלִים — in the cleavage of the valleys.”

### passuk 30
<b>He will wage war for you.</b> On your behalf.

### passuk 31
<b>In the wilderness as you have seen.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This verse is connected to the previous verse: “As in everything that He did with you in Egypt,” and now also in the wilderness as you have seen how He carried, etc. 
<b>The way a man carries his son.</b> [Understand this] just as I explained the verse: “the angel of Elohim moved [from its position] when it travelled in front of the camp of Yisroel, etc.” This can be compared to a person on a journey with his son walking ahead of him, and highwaymen come to kidnap him [the son], etc. 

### passuk 32
<b>Yet in this matter — </b> that He promised you to bring you to the Land, you did not trust Him. 

### passuk 33
<b>To show you [the way].</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The word לַרְאֹתְכֶם is the same as לְהַרְאֹתְכֶם . Similarly, הַנְחוֹתָם הַדֶּרֶך, [to lead them on the way] is the same as לְהַנְחֹתָם . Similarly, לַשְׁמִיעַ בְּקוֹל תּוֹדָה, [to make myself heard in a voice of thanksgiving is the same as לְהַשְׁמִיעַ .] Similarly, לָלֶכֶת לַגִיד בְּיִזְרְאֶל [ לַגִיד is the same as לְהַגִיד ] 

### passuk 34

### passuk 35

### passuk 36
<b>That he trod upon.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This refers to Chevron, as it is said, “And he came to Chevron.” 

### passuk 37

### passuk 40
<b>Turn yourselves [around].</b> I said [thought] to let you pass across the breadth of the land of Edom, northward, to enter the Land [Eretz Yisroel]; however you sinned and caused this delay for yourselves. 
<b>Turn yourselves [around].</b> Turn backwards and travel through the wilderness toward the Reed Sea, for the wilderness through which they were travelling, was south of Mount Seir, separating the Reed Sea and Mount Seir.
