<b>For he will turn your son away from me.</b> If the son of the gentile will marry your daughter, he will turn away your son (grandson) whom your daughter will bear for him, from following after Me. From this we learn that your daughter’s son, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>who is born of a gentile, is considered <i>your</i> son; but your son’s son, born of a gentile woman, is not considered your son, rather <i>her</i> son; for it is not said [regarding the prohibition:] “Do not take his daughter for your son,” because <i>she</i> will turn [your (grand)son away from Me], but only that <i>he</i> (the gentile) will turn your son, etc.

<b>Not because of the multitude of your population.</b> This is to be taken literally, but there is also a Midrashic interpretation: Because you do not magnify yourselves (boasting) when I shower you with goodness, therefore did [Hachem] delight in you. 
<b>For you are the least.</b> You diminish yourselves, as did Avrohom, who said, “I am but dust and ashes,” and like Moshe and Aharon who said, “What are we”? And you are not as Nevuchadnetzar, who said, “I will be compared to the Most High,” or like like Sancherev, who said, “Who are they among all the gods of these lands, [that have delivered their land out of my hand that Hachem should deliver Jerusalem and of my hand”?] or like Chirom, who said, “I am a god, in the seat of God, I sit.”

### passuk 13
<b>The offspring of your cattle.</b> The young of your cattle <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>which the female casts out from her womb.

Onkelos translates it as herds of your sheep. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Our Sages said: “Why are they called עַשְׁתָּרֹת ? “Because they enrich their owners.”

### passuk 17
<b>Perhaps you may think to yourself.</b> You must agree that (כִּי) in this context is an expression of perhaps: Perhaps you may think to yourself “Because they are [so] many, I will be unable to dispossess them.” You should not say [think] so. Do not fear them. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>And it is impossible to explain [the word כִּי ] according to any of the other meanings of כִּי that would fit in with: Do not fear them.

<b>Lest the wild animals multiply against you.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>But is it not true that if they do the will of the Omnipresent they would not have to fear the beast, as it is said, “And the wild animals will be at peace with you”? However it was known to Him that they would sin in the future. 

### passuk 23
<b>And will confuse them.</b> Both syllables of the word הָמָם have a <i>kometz</i> vowel because the last <i>mem</i> is not part of the root. Thus וְהָמָם is the same as וְהָם אוֹתָם [and will confuse them]. However (the word וְהָמַם in the verse,) “And though the roller of his wagon was noisy,” the verb הָמַם consists entirely of root letters; therefore half of it has a <i>kometz</i> (הָ) and half of it has a <i>patach</i> (מַ) like any other verb of three letters.
