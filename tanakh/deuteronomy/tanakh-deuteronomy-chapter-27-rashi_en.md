<b>To bless the people.</b> As stated in tractate Sotah. Six tribes ascended the summit of Mount Gerizim, and six the summit of Mount Eival, with the <i>kohanim</i> and <i>Levi’im</i> and the ark below, at the center. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The <i>Levi’im</i> directed their faces toward Mount Gerizim, and began the blessing: ‘Blessed is the man who does not make a sculpture or molten idol, etc.’ These, and the others as well, answered, <i>Amein.</i> They turned, directed their faces toward Mount Eival, and began the curse, saying: ‘Cursed is the man who makes a sculpture, etc.’ [These, and the others as well, answered <i>Amein.</i> They turned, directed their faces toward Mount Gerizim, and said: ‘Blessed is the one who does not revile his father or mother,’ etc. Then they turned, directed their faces toward Mount Eival, saying: ‘Cursed is the one who reviles his father or mother.’] Similarly with all of them, until ‘Cursed is whoever does not uphold.’

<b>Whoever strikes his fellow in secret.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This refers to slander. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>I have seen [this] in R’ Moshe Hadarshan’s commentary: There are eleven curses here, corresponding to eleven tribes. However, corresponding to Shimon, no curse is recorded. Because he (Moshe) did not intend to bless him before his death, as he blessed the other tribes, he, therefore, did not want to curse him.

### passuk 26
<b>Whoever does not uphold.</b> Here, he encompasses all of the Torah in its entirety, which they accepted by an imprecation and an oath.
