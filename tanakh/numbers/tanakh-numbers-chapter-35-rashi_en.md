### passuk 2
<b>And open space.</b> Open space, an empty area surrounding the city, to beautify the city. One is not permitted to build a house there, or plant a vineyard, or sow seeds. 

### passuk 3
<b>And all of their necessities to live.</b> For all their vital needs.

### passuk 4
<b>A thousand <i>amos</i> all around.</b> But afterward it says, “two thousand <i>amos.</i>” How is this? He gave them two thousand (<i>amos</i>) all around the city. Of those, the inner thousand are for parkland, and the outer (thousand) are for fields and vineyards.

### passuk 11
<b>You shall provide.</b> הַקְרָיָיה means [nothing but] providing. Similarly, it says, “because the Hachem your God provided for me.” 

### passuk 12
<b>From the avenger.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Against the blood redeemer, who is the kinsman of the murder victim. 

### passuk 13
<b>Six refuge cities.</b> This teaches that although Moshe designated three cities across the Yardein, during his lifetime, they did not absorb, until the selection of <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the three that Yehoshua placed in the land of Canaan. 

### passuk 14
<b>Three cities, etc.</b> Although there were, in the land of Canaan, nine tribes, and here only two and one half, the number of their cities of refuge was the same. Because Gil’ad was <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>rife 
with murderers, as it is written, “Gil’ad, city of evildoers, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>bloody ambush.” 

### passuk 15

### passuk 16
<b>But if he struck him with an iron instrument. </b> This does not refer to the inadvertent killing discussed in the preceding context, but, rather, to premeditated murder. It teaches that all implements of murder must be sizable enough to kill, for it is said, concerning all of them, “which can kill,” rendered by Targum [Onkelos], <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>”of a size capable of killing” — except for iron. For it is clearly evident to The Holy One, Blessed is He, that iron of any size can kill, even a needle. The Torah, therefore, did not specify a size by saying “which can kill.” Still, you may ask, “perhaps our passage refers to one who killed inadvertently?” <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>But it states, below, “or, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>with a stone which can kill, without seeing, etc.” This teaches that, in its statements above, Scripture refers to premeditated murder. 

### passuk 17
<b>With a stone that can be held in the hand.</b> Large enough to fill the hand.
<b>Which can kill.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Large enough to kill, as rendered by Targum [Onkelos]. Since it is said, “if a man strikes his fellow with a stone” without specifying its size, perhaps any size? It is said, therefore, “which can kill.” 

### passuk 18
<b>Or with a wooden implement [that can be held] in the hand.</b> Since it is said, “if a man strikes his slave or his maidservant with a rod,” perhaps any size? It is said, concerning wood, therefore, “which can cause death” — it must be sizable enough to kill. 

### passuk 19
<b>Wherever he meets him.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Even inside the cities of refuge. 

### passuk 20
<b>Deliberately.</b> As Targum [Onkelos] renders, בְּכַמְנָא, “from ambush.” 

### passuk 21

### passuk 22
<b>Suddenly.</b> Accidentally. Targum [Onkelos] renders בִּתְכֵיף, “suddenly.” He was nearby, and there was no time for him to take heed. 

### passuk 23
<b>Or with a stone which can kill.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>He struck him.
<b>Without seeing.</b> He did not see him. 
<b>He threw it down on him.</b> From here they (the Rabbis) said, “someone who kills <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>while descending, is exiled; [but if he kills] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>while ascending, is not exiled.” 

### passuk 24

### passuk 25
<b>Until the death of the Kohen gadol.</b> As he causes the Divine Presence to reside in Israel, and lengthens their lives, while the murderer causes the Divine Presence to leave Israel, and shortens their lives, he (the murderer) is unworthy of being in the presence of the <i>Kohen Gadol</i>. Another interpretation: Because the <i>Kohen Gadol</i> should have prayed <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>that this pitfall not occur in Israel during his lifetime. 
<b>Who was anointed with the sacred oil.</b> According to its plain meaning, this is one of the shortened passages, as it does not explain <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>who anointed him, but, rather, as if to say, “whom, whoever anointed him with the sacred oil.” Our sages expound this, in <i>Maseches</i> Makos, as verification of a teaching, to teach that, if before his case was decided, the <i>Kohen Gadol</i> died and another was appointed in his place, and his case was then decided, he is released from exile at the death of the second, as it is said, “whom he anointed.” Was it he who anointed him as a <i>Kohen,</i> or a <i>Kohen</i> who anointed him? Therefore, this is meant to include one who was anointed in his days — that he is released from exile at his death. 

### passuk 26

### passuk 27
<b>lit. He has no blood.</b> It is as if he had murdered a lifeless man, as his blood is forfeit. 

### passuk 28

### passuk 29
<b>In all your dwelling places.</b> This teaches that the lower Sanhedrin court functions outside the land <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>so long as it functions in Eretz Yisroel.

### passuk 30
<b>If anyone lls a person, etc.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The one who endeavors to kill him because he had killed a person. . . 
<b>Upon the testimony of witnesses shall [the murderer] be killed.</b> Who testify that the murderer acted intentionally, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>and was forwarned. 

### passuk 31
<b>And do not accept atonement compensation.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>He cannot absolve himself with money

### passuk 32
<b>And, do not accept atonement compensation for one who has fled to his refuge city.</b> For, someone who fled to a refuge city because he killed inadvertently, is not absolved from exile with money, by paying atonement compensation so that he may return and dwell in the land before the <i>Kohen</i> dies. 
<b> לָנוּס .</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Like לְנָס, as in שׁוּבֵי מִלְחָמָה, “who returned from battle.” Similarly, נוּגֵי מִמּוֹעֵד, “who were excluded from the festivals.” Similarly, כִּי מֻלִים הָיוּ, “for they were circumcised.” Just as one says שׁוּב concerning someone who has already returned, and מוּל concerning someone who was already circumcised, so does one say לָנוּס concerning someone who has already fled. He is called נוּס as if to say מֻבְרָח, “has fled.” But perhaps you might interpret לָנוּס as לִבְרוֹחַ,”to flee,” and explain “do not accept atonement compensation” “for someone who must flee,” and absolve him from exile? Then I do not know how it could say “so that he may return and dwell in the land,” when he did not yet flee — from where shall he return? 

### passuk 33
<b>Do not pollute (lit. falsely flatter).</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Do not bring evil, as Targum [Onkelos] renders, וְלָא תְחַיְּבוּן, “do not bring guilt.” 

### passuk 34
<b>Wherein I reside.</b> Do not cause Me to reside in its defilement.
<b>For I, Hachem, dwell among Bnei Yisroel.</b> Even when they are defiled, the Divine Presence rests among them.
