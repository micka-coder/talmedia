<b>Command Bnei Yisroel.</b> What is stated above? <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>”May God command. . .” The Holy One, Blessed is He, said to him, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>‘Before you command Me concerning My children, command My children concerning Me.’ This is comparable to a princess who was passing from the world. She instructed her husband concerning her children, etc., as is stated in Sifri. 
<b>My offering.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This refers to the blood.
<b>My bread.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This refers to the “<i>emurin</i>” parts, as it is said, “The <i>Kohen</i> shall burn them on the altar, bread of the fire.” 
<b>Of My fires.</b> to be placed on the fires of My altar.
<b>You shall be vigilant.</b> The <i>kohanim,</i> Levites and Bnei Yisroel shall stand over it. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>They learned from here, and instituted the “<i>ma’amados</i>” units. 
<b>At its prescribed time.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Every day is the time prescribed for the constant-offerings.

### passuk 3
<b>Say to them.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This is an admonishment to the <i>Bais Din</i>.
<b>Two each day.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Like the plain interpretation, but essentially, it teaches <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>that they should be slaughtered towards the sun, the constant morning sacrifice to the west, and that of the afternoon <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>to the east of the rings. 

### passuk 4
<b>One lamb.</b> Although it is already stated in the <i>parasha</i> of “You shall command” — “this is what you shall offer,” — those instructions were for the days of inauguration, whereas <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>here, the commandment is for all the generations. 

### passuk 5
<b>Fine flour as a meal-offering.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The libation <i>minchah.</i>

### passuk 6
<b>As offered on Mount Sinai.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Like those which were done during the days of inauguration. Another interpretation [of] which was done at Mount Sinai: The constant burnt-offering is compared to the burnt-offering at Mount Sinai — the one brought before the giving of the Torah — of which Scripture states “. . .and [he] placed it in the basins.” This teaches that it (the constant-offering) requires a vessel.

### passuk 7
<b>Its libation.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Wine.
<b>In the Holy [Sanctuary], you shall pour.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>They shall be poured on the altar. 
<b>An intoxicating libation.</b> Intoxicating wine. This excludes wine, fresh from the wine press. 

### passuk 8
<b>A pleasing aroma.</b> It pleases Me that I spoke and My wish was fulfilled.

### passuk 9

### passuk 10
<b>This is the burnt-offering on its Shabbos.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>But not one Shabbos burnt-offering on another Shabbos. Suppose it was not offered on this Shabbos, I might think that two should be offered on the following Shabbos. The Torah therefore teaches “on its Shabbos.” This informs us that once its day has passed, the offering expires. 
<b>In addition to the constant (daily) burnt-offering.</b> This refers to the <i>musaf</i> sacrifices, aside from the two constant burnt-offering lambs. This teaches that they (the <i>musaf</i> sacrifices) may be brought only <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>between the two constant-offerings. Similarly, concerning all the <i>musaf</i> sacrifices it is said, “in addition to the constant burnt-offering,” for this teaching. 

### passuk 11

### passuk 12
<b>Three tenths [of an <i>eiphah</i>].</b> As specified for the libations of a bull, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>designated as such in the chapter of the libations. 

### passuk 13

### passuk 14
<b>This is the burnt-offering of each [Rosh] Chodesh, at its renewal.</b> But once its designated day has passed, the offering expires, with no provision for restitution. 

### passuk 15
<b>And one he-goat, etc.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>All the <i>musaf</i> goats came in atonement for <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the ritual defilement of the Sanctuary and its sacred objects, everything as explained in Tractate Shevuos. There is a distinction with the New Moon goat, for it is said, concerning it, “. . .to God.” This teaches you that it atones for someone <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>who was not cognizant either at the beginning or the end, as no one recognizes the transgression save for the Holy One, Blessed is He, alone. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The other goats are derived from this one. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This is also expounded <i>aggadically</i> [as follows]: The Holy One, Blessed is He, said: ‘Bring atonement for Me, because I diminished the moon.’ 
<b>In addition to the constant (daily) burnt-offering, it shall be done.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This entire offering. 
<b>And its libation.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>”Its libation” does not relate to the goat, as a sin-offering has no libation. 

### passuk 16

### passuk 18
<b>Any work of consequence.</b> Even work necessary for you, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>for example, to prevent a loss, which is permitted during the intermediary holiday, is prohibited during the festival. 

### passuk 19
<b>Bulls.</b> Corresponding with Avraham, as it is said, “Avraham ran to the cattle.” 
<b>Ram.</b> Corresponding with the ram of Yitzchak.
<b>Sheep.</b> Corresponding with Yaakov, as it is said, “Yaakov separated the lambs.” I saw this in R’ Moshe Hadarshan’s commentary.

<b>Like these, yoshall make daily.</b> They should not be progressively decreasing like the oxen of the [<i>Succos</i>] festival. 

### passuk 25

### passuk 26
<b>On the day of the first fruits.</b> The Shavuos festival is called “[The festival of] the first fruits of the wheat harvest,” because of the offering of the two loaves, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>which are the first of the wheat <i>minchah</i>-offerings to come from the new crop.

<b>[The sacrifices] shall be without blemish — and their libations.</b> The libations must also be unblemished. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The Rabbis derive from this that wine in which floury decay globules have surfaced is disqualified for libations.
