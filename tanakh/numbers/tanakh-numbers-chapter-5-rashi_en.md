<b>Command Bnei Yisroel.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This <i>parshah</i> was said on the day the <i>Mishkon</i> was erected. Eight <i>parshiyos</i> were said on that day, as is stated in Tractate Gittin, <i>perek</i> Hanizakin. 
<b>They must expel from the camp.</b> There were <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>three camps when they rested: Within the curtains was the camp of the <i>Shechinah;</i> the surrounding Levite encampment, as stated expressly in the <i>parshah</i> of Bemidbar Sinai, was the camp of the Levites; from there to the end of the encampment of the banners, in all the four directions, was the camp of the Israelites. The <i>metzoro</i> was sent <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>out of all of them. The <i>zav</i> was permitted in the camp of the Israelites, but expelled from the [other] two. A person defiled by the dead was permitted even among the [encampment of] the Levites, being expelled only <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>from the encampment of the <i>Shechinah.</i> All this, the Rabbis derive from Scriptural passages in Maseches Pesachim. 
<b>Defiled by a [departed] soul.</b> [Onkelos renders] דִּמְסָאָב לִטְמֵי נַפְשָׁא דֶאֱנָשָׁא, (“who were defiled by the bones of a human soul.”) In my opinion, the word <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>means “human bones” in Aramaic. There are many [examples] in Bereishis Rabbah, “ טַמְיָא “ אַדְרִיאָנוּס שְׁחִיק — may [his] “bones” be crushed.

### passuk 6
<b>Acting treacherously against Adonoy.</b> Scripture now reiterates the <i>parshah</i> of the thief who swears falsely, previously stated in the Portion of Vayikra, “[If a person sins] . . . and acts treacherously against God, lying to his fellow . . .” It is repeated here for the sake of two innovations. Firstly, Scripture writes “And they confess . . . [their sin],” teaching that he (the thief) is not required to pay the fifth and bring the <i>asham</i> (guilt-offering) when convicted by the testimony of witnesses, unless he confesses to the act. And secondly, [to teach] that property stolen from a proselyte must be given to the <i>kohanim.</i> 

### passuk 7
<b>Principal amount of his guilt.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This is the principal [payment] concerning which he took the oath.
<b>To whom he is indebted.</b> To the one <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>to whom he is liable.

### passuk 8
<b>But if the man has no redeemer.</b> As the claimant died who put him (the thief) to the oath — without heirs.
<b>To whom the debt may be returned.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>When he (the thief) recants and confesses to his crime. The Rabbis remark, ‘Is there anyone in Yisroel without redeemers, whether a son, brother, or paternal blood relation [branching] upward to [the patriarch] Yaakov? But <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>[this refers to] a proselyte who died without heirs. 
<b>The debt being returned.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This is the principal and the fifth thereof.
<b>To Adonoy, [then] to the kohein.</b> God takes possession of it, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>then gives it to the <i>kohein [serving] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>in that watch. </i>
<b>Besides the ram of forgiveness.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Mentioned in Vayikra, which he is required to bring. 

### passuk 9
<b>Every terumah-gift, etc.</b> R’ Yishmael said, “Is <i>terumah</i>-gift brought to the <i>kohein</i>? Does he not seek it, himself, in the granary? Then why does the Torah state, ‘ . . . which they bring to the <i>kohein</i>?’ These are the <i>bikurim</i>-gifts, about which it is stated, ‘[. . . the first fruits of your land] must be brought to the House of Adonoy, your God.’ <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>But one does not know what must be done with them. The Torah therefore states, ‘ . . . to the <i>kohein,</i> it shall belong to him.’ Scripture teaches, concerning the <i>bikurim</i>-gifts, that they must be given to the <i>kohein.</i> 

### passuk 10
<b>A man’s sacred objects shall be his.</b> Since the priestly and Levite gifts are mandated, one might assume that they may confiscate them forcefully. The Torah therefore teaches that “A man’s sacred objects shall be his,” <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>informing [us] that the executory benefits belong to the [original Israelite] owner. Many other homiletical interpretations are offered by Sifri. Midrash Aggadah [states], “A man’s sacred objects shall be his” [states]: If someone withholds his tithes, and refuses to give them, [then] “[they shall] be his” — the tithes. Ultimately, his land will yield only one tenth of its normal produce. 
<b>Whatever a man gives to the kohein [lit. A man who gives to the <i>kohein].</i></b><i> The proper gifts. </i>
<b>Shall be his.</b> Great riches.

### passuk 11

### passuk 12
<b>If any man’s wife goes astray.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>What is written [immediately] above this subject? “A man’s sacred objects shall be his.” (v. 10) [This implies that] If you withhold the <i>kohein’s</i> gifts, then by your life! You will find it necessary to visit him, to bring the <i>sotah</i> to him. 
<b>Any man [lit. A man, a man].</b> This teaches that she is doubly treacherous; against the “man of warfare” on high, and her husband [lit. “man”] below. 
<b>[If any man’s] wife goes astray.</b> Our Rabbis teach: Adulterers do not commit adultery unless they are imbued with the <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>spirit of foolishness, as it is written כִּי תִשְׂטֶה [lit. acts foolishly]. and it is written, “the adulterer lacks reason”: The simple explanation of the verse is, “[If any man’s wife] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>turns aside from the ways of modesty” and arouses his suspicion, as in “turn aside from him, and pass by,” “let your heart not turn to her ways. 
<b>And acts treacherously toward him.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>What is the treachery? 

### passuk 13
<b>And a man has lain.</b> This excludes a minor and a non-human.
<b>With her.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Lying with her disqualifies her. but not laying with her sister (as in the incident of two sisters who resembled one another). 
<b>But it was hidden from her husband’s eyes.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This excludes a blind man. Therefore, if he (the husband) saw [the adultery] and feigned ignorance, the [bitter] waters do not test her. 
<b>She was concealed.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Long enough to have been defiled by intercourse.
<b>There is no witness against her.</b> But if <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>even one witness testified that she was defiled [by intercourse], she did not drink [the bitter waters]. 
<b>There is no witness against her.</b> To the defilement, but there are witnesses to the concealment. 
<b>Seized forcibly.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Ravished, as in, “. . . siezed her forcibly and laid with her.” 

### passuk 14
<b>Comes upon him.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Before the concealment.
<b>A spirit of jealousy, and he is jealous.</b> The Rabbis interpret this as “warning.” He warns her not to be alone with a certain man, 
<b>And she was defiled. Or, comes upon him . . . etc.</b> As if it had said, ‘he warned her and she ignored the warning, but <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>it is not known whether or not she was defiled.’ 

### passuk 15
<b>flour.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>But not of fine flour.
<b>Barley.</b> But not wheat. [Because] she acted like an animal, her offering consists of animal feed. 
<b>He shall not pour oil over it.</b> So that her offering may not be resplendent. for, [olive] oil is <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>identified as light, while she acted in darkness. 
<b>He shall not put frankincense on it.</b> The matriarchs are called “frankincense,” as it is said, “. . . and to the hill of frankincense,” but she departed from their ways. 
<b>For it is a meal-offering of jealousy.</b> This meal. “Meal” is masculine.
<b>A meal-offering of jealousy (wrath).</b> She arouses a double wrath against her; the wrath of the Supreme Omnipresent Being, and the wrath of her husband. 

### passuk 16

### passuk 17
<b>Sanctified waters.</b> Sanctified in the wash basin. Because the wash basin was made from the copper of the “multitude mirrors,” while this [<i>sotah</i>] departed from their ways. They had relations with their husbands in Egypt beneath the apple tree, but this [<i>sotah</i>] corrupted herself with a stranger — let her be tested by it (the wash basin). 
<b>In a clay utensil.</b> She served the adulterer excellent wine in superb goblets — therefore, let her drink the bitter water in a wretched clay cup. 

### passuk 18
<b>The kohein shall station . . . etc., </b> Has it not already said, ‘ . .and station her before Adonoy’? (V. 16) <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>But, they moved her from place to place to exhaust her, so that she might lose her composure and confess. 
<b>Expose.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>He disentangles the plaits of her hair, to humiliate her. From this we derive that, for daughters of Yisroel, a bared head is <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>debasing. 
<b>Before Adonoy.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>At the <i>Nikanor</i> gate. This was the eastern gateway to the [Temple] courtyard, the route by which everyone entered. 
<b>And place, on her palms.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>To exhaust her, [in the hope] that she might lose her composure and confess, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>so that the Sacred Name not be erased in the water. 
<b>The bitter.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Because of their aftermath, when they are bitter to her. 
<b>Lethal.</b> Which eliminate her from the world, like the phrase, “. . . lethal thornbush.” But it is inappropriate to translate “accursed waters,” as they are sacred [v.17]. And Scripture does not write אֲרוּרִים, but מְאָרְרִים — affecting others. Even Onkelos did not translate לִיטַיָּא, “accursed,” but מְלַטְטַיָּא, “curse causing” — they reveal the curse in the body of this [<i>sotah</i>]. 

### passuk 19
<b>Shall place her under oath . . . etc. </b> What is the oath? <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>‘If no [man] laid [with you], be absolved but if he laid [with you], may you choke’! A negative statement expresses, by implication, its positive converse, but we are commanded to open capital cases with the presumption of innocence. 

### passuk 20
<b>If you have gone astray.</b> כִּי is used <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>in the sense of “if.”

### passuk 21
<b>With the oath of accursedness.</b> The oath which contains the curse.
<b>Adonoy shall make you a curse:</b> Everyone will curse through you: ‘May [a curse] befall you <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the way it befell so-and-so.’
<b>And an oath.</b> Everyone will swear through you: ‘If [my oath is] not [true], may [disaster] happen to me the way it happened to so-and-so. Similarly, it says, “you will leave your names [to be used] as an oath by My chosen.” — the virtuous swear by the punishment of the wicked. Similarly, with regard to blessings, “and through you will be blessed . . . etc., “through you shall [the People of] Yisroel bless, saying. . .” 
<b>Your thigh.</b> In the curse, the thigh precedes the abdomen, because her transgression began there. 
<b>Swell.</b> As Targum [Onkelos] translates, “swollen.” 

### passuk 22
<b>To swell the abdomen.</b> [לַצְבּוֹת בֶּטֶן is] like לְהַצְבּוֹת בֶּטֶן, “to cause the abdomen to swell.” This is the function of the פַּתַּח when it vocalizes the ל' . Similarly, לַנְחוֹתָם הַדֶּרֶךְ, (“to lead them on the way,”) לַרְאוֹתְכֶם בַּדֶּרֶךְ אֲשֶר תֵּלְכוּ בָהּ (“to show you the way in which to go.”) Similarly, לַנְפִּל יָרֵך, לְהַנְפִּיל יָרֵךְ (“to cause the thigh to collapse”). The waters swell the abdomen and collapse the thigh. 
<b>To swell the abdomen and collapse the thigh.</b> The abdomen and thigh of the adulterer, or perhaps it refers only to the adulteress? When Scripture says, “. . . your thigh to collapse and abdomen to swell,” the [punishment of the] adulteress has been stated. 
<b>Amein, Amein.</b> [This is] The acceptance of the oath. Amein <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>for the curse, Amein for the oath. Amein if [I strayed] from this husband, Amein if [I strayed] from a different husband. Amein that I did not stray [when] betrothed, married, levirately engaged or taken to his home. 

### passuk 23

### passuk 24
<b>He shall have the woman drink.</b> It was not done in this order, as <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>he brought her offering first. But Scripture informs you that when he does give her the waters, they will penetrate her with bitterness. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Since it [merely] says “abdomen” and “thigh,” how do we know the rest of the body [is affected]? The Torah states “and [the waters] shall enter her,” completely. If so, why does the Torah say “abdomen” and “thigh”? Since they began the transgression, the punishment began with them. 
<b>To become bitter.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>They will be harmful and bitter for her. 

### passuk 25
<b>And shall wave.</b> He moves it forward, back, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>up, and down. She, too, waves with him, with her hand <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>above the hand of the <i>kohein.</i> 
<b>And bring it.</b> This refers to placing it at the southwest corner of the altar <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>before taking the handful, like the other <i>minchah</i>- offerings. 

### passuk 26
<b>Its commemoration.</b> This is the handful. Through its burning, the <i>mincha</i>-offering is remembered on high. (Sifri, 5:72.) 

### passuk 27
<b>He shall make her drink the water.</b> [This is written] to add that if she said, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>”I will not drink” after the scroll was erased, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>we coerce her, forcing her to drink against her will, unless she says “I am defiled.” 
<b>Her abdomen will swell.</b> Although, in the curse, Scripture mentions the thigh first, the water <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>tested her just the way it entered her. 
<b>The woman will be a curse.</b> As I explained, everyone will <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>use her to curse. 
<b>Among her people.</b> There is a difference between a person disgraced <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>among those who know her, and a person disgraced among those who do not know her. 

### passuk 28
<b>But if the woman was not defiled.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>During this concealment.
<b>And is pure.</b> From any other place.
<b>She will be cleansed.</b> Of the lethal waters. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Furthermore, “she will bear seed” — if she suffered during childbirth, her labor will now be painless. If she gave birth to swarthy [babies], they will now be light. 

### passuk 29

### passuk 30
<b>If (lit., or) [he is] a man.</b> As in, “If it was known.” As if it had said, “If he is a vengeful man, and, therefore, he shall have the woman stand.” 

### passuk 31
<b>The man is cleansed of sin.</b> If the water affected her, let him not be tormented saying: “I was responsible for her death.” He is cleansed from punishment. Another interpretation: After he (the <i>kohein</i>) causes her to drink, she is permitted to be with him (her husband), and he is cleansed of sin. For, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the [untested] <i>sotah</i> is forbidden to [have intimate relations with] her husband.
