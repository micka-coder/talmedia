### passuk 1
<b>In the first month.</b> The chapter at the beginning of this book <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>was not said until Iyar. You learn, that there is no order of precedence or succession in the Torah. But why did He not begin with this [chapter]? Because it is to Yisroel’s discredit, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>that throughout the forty years that Yisroel was in the wilderness they offered no other <i>Pesach</i>-offering but this. 

### passuk 2
<b>In its proper time.</b> Even on Shabbos; <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>even during ritual uncleanliness. 

### passuk 3
<b>According to all its statutes.</b> These are the commandments pertaining to its body [i.e., the animal itself] a lamb; unblemished; male; a yearling. 
<b>And according to all its laws.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>These are commandments having a bearing on the animal but originate from another place (i.e., outside the animal) For example, the seven days of eating <i>matzoh</i> and of eliminating <i>chometz</i>. ([An alternate text:] The commandments pertaining to its body — a lamb; unblemished; male; a yearling. Having a bearing on the animal; roasted over fire, its head with its knees and its inner organs. Outside its body — <i>matzoh</i> and eliminating <i>chometz.</i>) 

### passuk 4
<b>Moshe spoke, etc.</b> What does the Torah teach? Does it not say, “Moshe spoke <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>of God’s holidays”? Evidently, when he heard the <i>parshah</i> of the holidays at Sinai, he told it to them, and then he reviewed it and exhorted them at the time it was to be performed. 

### passuk 5

### passuk 6
<b>Before Moshe and before Aharon.</b> When both were seated in the study hall, they approached them and asked. But it is untenable to say [that they asked them] one after the other, for if Moshe did not know, how would Aharon [know]? 

### passuk 7
<b>Why should we be excluded.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>He (Moshe) said to them: “The sacred offerings cannot be brought during ritual impurity.” They said to him: “[But] let the blood be sprinkled on us by ritually pure <i>kohanim</i> and the flesh eaten by those who are pure.” He said to them: “Wait, while I listen,” like a disciple assured of hearing from his master’s mouth. Fortunate is the mortal thus assured, for whenever he wished, he could speak with the Divine Presence. Now <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>this chapter should appropriately have been said through Moshe, as is all the rest of the Torah. But these [people] gained the merit of having it said through them, because Providence brings about merit through the meritorious.

### passuk 10
<b>Or on a distant road.</b> There is a dot over this, as if to say: Not that it was definitely distant, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>but that he was outside the threshold of the [Temple] courtyard thoughout the time for slaughtering [the Pesach]. [At] the second <i>Pesach, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>matzoh</i> and <i>chometz</i> may be with him at home; it is not considered ‘<i>yom tov</i>’; and <i>chometz</i> is not prohibited except while he eats [the <i>korbon</i>].

### passuk 14
<b>If a proselyte dwells among you, and brings the Pesach-offering.</b> Perhaps everyone who converts must immediately bring the <i>Pesach</i>-offering? The Torah therefore teaches, “One statute, etc . . .” Rather, this is its meaning: “If a proselyte dwells among you, and he comes to bring the <i>Pesach</i>-offering with his fellows, according to the statutes of the <i>Pesach</i>-offering and its laws shall he do.” 

### passuk 15
<b>The Mishkon [which served] as the Tent of Testimony.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The <i>Mishkon</i> which was made to be a tent for the tablets of testimony.
<b>There was over the <i>Mishkon.</i></b> Similar to, “would constantly be” over the <i>Mishkon.</i> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Similarly, all the usages in the <i>parshah.</i> 

### passuk 16

### passuk 17
<b>The Cloud was lifted.</b> As Targum [Onkelos] renders, אִסְתַּלָּקוּת, (“was lifted”). Similarly, “the Cloud <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>was lifted.” But it would be improper to write “According to when the Cloud rose,” “the Cloud rose,” because the connotation is not rising, but flowering and ascending, as in, “behold, a tiny cloud, like a man’s palm, rises from the sea.” 

### passuk 18
<b>On the word of Adonoy did they travel.</b> We learned in [the Beraysa describing] the work of the <i>Mishkon</i>; When the Israelites were departing the Cloud column would fold, and extend over the tribe of Yehudah like a type of beam. They sounded the <i>tekiah, teruah,</i> and <i>tekiah. But it did not proceed until Moshe intoned, “Rise, Adonoy . . .” Then the banner of the camp of Yehudah departed. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This is in Sifri. </i>
<b>On the word of Adonoy did they camp.</b> When the Israelites were camping, the Cloud column would mushroom upward and extend over the tribe of Yehudah like a type of protective covering. It did not separate until Moshe said, “Come to rest, Adonoy, among the myriads and thousands of Israel.” Thus you say, “on the order of Adonoy, through Moshe.” 

### passuk 19

### passuk 20
<b>Sometimes (lit. there is).</b> As if to say, “sometimes.” 
<b>A number of days.</b> “a few days.” 

### passuk 21

### passuk 22
<b>Or a year. (lit. days).</b> A year, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>as in “[יָמִים], a year shall be its redemption [period].”
