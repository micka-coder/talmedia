And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:

### passuk 2
’Send thou men, that they may spy out the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel; of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a prince among them.’

### passuk 3
And Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran according to the commandment of the LORD; all of them men who were heads of the children of Israel.

### passuk 4
And these were their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.

### passuk 5
Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.

### passuk 6
Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.

### passuk 7
Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.

### passuk 8
Of the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun.

### passuk 9
Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.

### passuk 10
Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.

### passuk 11
Of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi.

### passuk 12
Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.

### passuk 13

### passuk 14
Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.

### passuk 15
Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.

### passuk 16
These are the names of the men that Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua.

### passuk 17
And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them: ‘Get you up here into the South, and go up into the mountains;

### passuk 18
and see the land, what it is; and the people that dwelleth therein, whether they are strong or weak, whether they are few or many;

### passuk 19
and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad; and what cities they are that they dwell in, whether in camps, or in strongholds;

### passuk 20
and what the land is, whether it is fat or lean, whether there is wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land.’—Now the time was the time of the first-ripe grapes.—

### passuk 21
So they went up, and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, at the entrance to Hamath.

### passuk 22
And they went up into the South, and came unto Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were there.—Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.—

### passuk 23
And they came unto the valley of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bore it upon a pole between two; they took also of the pomegranates, and of the figs.—

### passuk 24
That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the children of Israel cut down from thence.—

### passuk 25
And they returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days.

### passuk 26
And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.

### passuk 27
And they told him, and said: ‘We came unto the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it.

### passuk 28
Howbeit the people that dwell in the land are fierce, and the cities are fortified, and very great; and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.

### passuk 29
Amalek dwelleth in the land of the South; and the Hittite, and

### passuk 30
And Caleb stilled the people toward Moses, and said: ‘We should go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.’

### passuk 31
But the men that went up with him said: ‘We are not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.’

### passuk 32
And they spread an evil report of the land which they had spied out unto the children of Israel, saying: ‘The land, through which we have passed to spy it out, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature.

### passuk 33
And there we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who come of the Nephilim; and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.’
