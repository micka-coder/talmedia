<b>Korach took.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This passage is beautifully expounded by Midrash R’ Tanchuma.
<b>Korach took.</b> He took himself to a different side, to be <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>disassociated from the community and to cast aspersion on the <i>kehunah</i>. This is why Onkelos translates וְאִתְפְּלֵג, he separated himself from the rest of the community in order to maintain the dispute. Similarly, “why does your heart take you?”— (i.e.,) it takes you to separate you from other people. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Another interpretation [of] “Korach took”: He won over the heads of the Sanhedrin among them, with flattering words, as it is said, “take Aharon,” “take words with you.” 
<b>The son of Yitzhar, the son of Kehat, the son of Levi.</b> But <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Scripture does not mention, “the son of Yaakov,” since he [Yaakov] implored [God] for compassion on himself that his name be omitted from their dispute, as it is said, “let my honor not be identified with their assembly.” <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Where is his (Yaakov’s) name mentioned with Korach? At the genealogical identification [of the Levites] at the platform, in Divrei Hayamim, as it is said, “the son of Evyasaf, the son of Korach, the son of Yitzhar, the son of Kehat, the son of Levi, the son of Yisroel.” 
<b>And Dasan and Aviram.</b> Because the tribe of Reuven made their camp at the south, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>neighboring Kehat and his sons, who camped at the south, they joined Korach in his dispute. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>”Woe to the wicked, woe to his neighbor”! <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Why did Korach see fit to dispute Moshe? He envied <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Elitzafan the son of Uziel for his leadership. Moshe appointed him leader over the sons of Kehat, by the word of God. Korach said, ‘Father had four brothers, as it is said: “The sons of Kehat, etc.” Amram was the firstborn. His two sons assumed great distinction — one (Moshe) is the monarch, the other (Aharon) the <i>Kohen Gadol</i>. Who should appropriately assume the second [position], if not I, the son of Yitzhar, second to Amram? Yet he appointed, as leader, the son of the youngest of all of his (Amram’s) brothers. I will oppose him, and nullify everything he said.’ What did he do? He rose up and gathered two hundred fifty heads of Sanhedrin, mostly from the neighboring tribe of Reuven — they were Elitzur the son of Shdeiur, and his companions, and the like, as it is said, “leaders of the congregation, who were called to meetings,” and it says above, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>”those called from the congregation (leaders of their ancestral tribes).” He clothed them in <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>garments made completely of <i>techeiles.</i> They came and stood before Moshe and said to him: “Does a garment made completely of <i>techeiles</i> require <i>tzitzis,</i> or not?’ He said to them: “It is required.” They began scoffing at him. “How is it possible that a garment made of other material is absolved by a single thread of <i>techeiles,</i> yet one made completely of <i>techeiles</i> cannot absolve itself?” 
<b>The sons of Reouven.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Dasan and Aviram, and On the son of Peles.

<b>You have [taken] too much for yourselves.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>You have taken much more distinction for yourselves [than is appropriate].
<b>Are all holy.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>They all heard the Word, at Sinai, from the mouth of the Almighty. 
<b>Why do you raise yourselves.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>If you took the monarchy, you should not have chosen the <i>kehunah</i> for your brother. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>You were not alone in hearing, at Sinai, “I am God your God”— the entire community heard. 

### passuk 4
<b>He fell upon his face.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Because of the dispute, as this was, already, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>their fourth despicable act. They sinned with the golden calf — “Moshe implored . . . “ With the complainers — “Moshe prayed . . .” With the spies — “Moshe said to God, If Egypt should hear. . .” At Korach’s dispute, his hands were weakened. This is compared to a prince who acted despicably against his father. His intimate friend placated him the first, second, and third times, but at the fourth despicable act, the friend’s hands were weakened. He said: “How long can I impose upon the king? Perhaps he will no longer receive me.” 

### passuk 5
<b>[In the] morning, [Hachem] will make known.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This is a time when we are intoxicated, and it would be improper [for us] to appear in His Presence. His intention was to delay, so that they might repent. 
<b>[In the] morning, Hachem will make known who is [qualified to be] His.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>For the Levite services. 
<b>And who is holy.</b> For the <i>kehunah</i>.
<b>He will bring.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Them close to Him. Targum [Onkelos] demonstrates this: “He will bring into His presence.” “He will bring into His service.” According to the Midrashic interpretation of “morning”: Moshe said to them, ‘God marked His universe with boundaries. Can you possibly transform morning into evening? that is how possible it is for you to nullify this, as it is said, “it became evening and it became morning, and He separated” Similarly, “Aharon was separated to be consecrated etc.” 

### passuk 6
<b>Do this: Take, for yourselves, fire pans.</b> Why did he see fit to tell them this? He said to them, “the gentile way is to have a variety of rituals, with many priests, [not all] gathered in one Temple. We have only one God, one Ark, one Torah, one Altar, and one <i>Kohen Gadol</i>. Yet you — two hundred and fifty men — seek the <i>kehunah Gedolah</i>! I, too, will acquiesce. Here you have the most precious service, the incense, more precious than all the sacrifices. But a deadly poison is placed in it, which consumed Nadav and Avihu.” He, therefore, warned them, “The man who will be chosen by Hachem, he is the holy one.” He was already holy. Do we not know that the chosen one is holy? Rather, Moshe said to them, “I tell you this so that you will not be found guilty. The chosen one will survive, but all of you will be lost.” 
<b>Fire pans.</b> Utensils for stoking coals, with a handle. 

### passuk 7
<b>You have taken [too] much upon yourselves, sons of Levi.</b> [I told you many things which are acceptable to the heart (i.e., reasonable). Another interpretation:] What I have said to you is a matter of great significance. Were they not fools, for he warned them, and yet they undertook to bring the offering? They sinned with their souls, as it is said, “the firepans of these sinners with their souls.” <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>But Korach who was astute, why did he see fit to engage in this foolishness? His vision deceived him. He saw a great dynasty descending from him — Shmuel, who was equal to Moshe and Aharon. He said, “for his sake, I will be spared.” And twenty four watches arising from his descendants, all prophesying by Divine inspiration, as it is said, “all of these were the sons of Heiman.” He said, “is it possible that all this greatness is destined to arise from me, and I shall remain silent”? This is why he participated, for, he had heard from Moshe’s mouth, that they would all be lost, but one would be spared: “The one whom God will choose, he is holy.” He mistakenly attributed this to himself, but his vision was flawed, as his sons repented. But Moshe saw. 
<b>Too much upon yourselves</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>You have undertaken a great task for yourselves to dispute the Holy One, Blessed is He. 

### passuk 8
<b>Moshe said to Korach, “Please listen, sons of Levi.”</b> He began speaking gently to him, but when he saw that he was stiff necked, he said, “before the other tribes join and are lost with him, I had better speak with all of them, too.” He began exhorting them, “please listen, sons of Levi.” 

### passuk 9
<b>And to stand before the congregation.</b> To sing on the platform.

### passuk 10
<b>He brought you near.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>To the service from which he distanced the rest of the community of Yisroel.

### passuk 11
<b>Therefore,</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Because of this, you, and your entire congregation who are gathered with you, have assembled against God, for I have acted as His representative in awarding the <i>kehunah</i> to Aharon. This quarrel is not with us. 

### passuk 12
<b>Moshe sent, etc.</b> From here [we derive] that one should not maintain a dispute, for Moshe sought them out in order to come to terms with them through a peaceful dialogue. 
<b>We will not go up.</b> Their own words caused them to stumble — they will have nothing but a downfall. 

### passuk 13

### passuk 14
<b>And [not] given us.</b> The statement relates to Gא (“not”), mentioned above, as if to say, “you have not brought us, and you have not given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>You told us, ‘I will bring you up out of the suffering of Egypt to a good land . . . [flowing with milk and honey].’ You brought us out of there, but not to a land flowing with milk and honey did you bring us. Rather, you decreed, against us, that we die in the wilderness, as you said to us, ‘Your corpses will fall in this wilderness’.” 
<b>If you put those people’s eyes out, etc.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Even if you send agents to put our eyes out unless we go up to you, we will not go up. 
<b>Those people.</b> Like a man who attributes his own curse to someone else.

### passuk 15
<b>Moshe was extremely distressed.</b> And Moshe was very grieved.
<b>Do not turn to their offering.</b> According to the plain interpretation, [through] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the incense which they will offer before you tomorrow, do not turn to them. According to the Midrash, he said, “I know <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>that they have a portion in the continual communal sacrifices. Let their portion not be received by you favorably. Let the fire allow it to remain without consuming it.” 
<b>Not a donkey did I sequester from any one of them.</b> I did not take a donkey from any <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>one of them. Even when I went from Midyan to Egypt and set my wife and sons on a donkey, when <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>I could have justifiably taken that donkey from them, I took only of my own. Onkelos translates שְׁחָרִית, “sequestered.” In Aramaic, the king’s service is called שַׁחְוַור . 

### passuk 16
<b>And they.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Your congregation.

### passuk 17
<b>And you will offer before Hachem each man his firepan.</b> The two hundred fifty men among you.

### passuk 18

### passuk 19
<b>Korach congregated against them.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>With mockery. All that night he went to the tribes and enticed them. — “Do you think I am indignant for my sake alone? I am indignant only for the sake of all of you! They came and took all the great offices, the monarchy for himself, and the <i>kehunah</i> for his brother. . .,” until they were all convinced. 
<b>The glory of Hachem appeared.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>He came in the pillar of cloud. 

### passuk 20

### passuk 21

### passuk 22
<b>Almighty, the God of the spirits.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Knower of thoughts. Your attributes are not like mortal attributes. A mortal king, against whom some of his kingdom acted scurrilously, does not know who the sinner is. Therefore, when he is angry, he punishes them all. But You — to You, all thoughts are revealed, and You know who the sinner is. 
<b>If one man.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Has sinned, will You <b>be angry with the entire congregation?</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The Holy One, Blessed is He, said: “You have spoken well. I know, and will make known, who sinned and who did not sin.” 

### passuk 23

### passuk 24
<b>Depart (lit. go up).</b> As Targum [Onkelos] renders, (אִסְתַּלָּקוּ), <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>”depart,” from around Korach’s dwelling. 

### passuk 25
<b>Moshe rose up.</b> He thought they would treat him with regard, but they did not. 

### passuk 26

### passuk 27
<b>Went out and stood.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>With a haughty bearing, to revile and blaspheme, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>as “he stood disdainfully for forty days” [at the incident] of Golias. 
<b>With their wives, children and infants.</b> Come, see <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>how inexorably destructive disputes are, for earthly tribunals do not mete out punishment until two pubic hairs have appeared, and the heavenly tribunal until twenty years, but here, even nursing infants perished. 

### passuk 28
<b>To perform all these deeds.</b> Which I have done by the word of God; <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>conferring the <i>kehunah Gedolah</i> on Aharon, [appointing] his sons as assistants, and Elitzafan as leader of the Kehatites. 

### passuk 29
<b>Hachem has not sent me.</b> Rather, I did everything independently, and he (Korach) is justified in opposing me. 

### passuk 30
<b>But if Hachem will create a new creation. </b>
 To kill them <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>with a death no one has ever experienced until now. What is this creation? “The earth will open its mouth and swallow them.” Then, you will know that they angered God, and I spoke according to the word of the Almighty. The Rabbis interpret, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>‘if the mouth of the earth was created during the six days of creation, fine, but if not, let God it create [now]!’ 

### passuk 31

<b>Fled from their uproar.</b> Because of <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the sound of the earth swallowing them up.
