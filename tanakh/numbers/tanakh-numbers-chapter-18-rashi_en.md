### passuk 1
<b>Hachem said to Aharon.</b> He told Moshe <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>to say to Aharon, To exhort him concerning [precautions] for the benefit of the Israelites, so that they do not enter the Sanctuary. 
<b>You, your sons, and your father’s house.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The children of Kehat, Amram’s father. 
<b>Will bear the sin of the Sanctuary.</b> I am casting, upon you, the punishment of the unauthorized persons who sin by their involvement with the sacred objects placed in your charge — the Tent, Ark, Table, and sacred vessels. You must station yourselves and warn every unauthorized person who attempts contact. 
<b>And you and your sons.</b> The <i>kohanim.</i>
<b>Will bear the sin of your <i>kehunah</i>.</b> Since it is not a charge given to the Levites, you must warn the erring Levites not to come in contact with you during your service. 

### passuk 2
<b>Also, your brothers.</b> The sons of Gershon and the sons of Merori. 
<b>They shall join you.</b> They shall unite with you <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>in also warning the unauthorized persons not to approach them.
<b>And serve you.</b> By guarding the gateways, and through the appointment, from them, of custodians and <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>administrators. 

### passuk 3

### passuk 4
<b>A commonor should not approach you.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>I admonish you about this.

### passuk 5
<b>So that there will be no more wrath.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>As there already was, as it is said, “for the wrath has surfaced.” 

### passuk 6
<b>Given to you as a gift.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Perhaps for your personal, secular service? The Torah, therefore, teaches, “for God,” as specified above, to attend to the mandate — custodians and administrators. 

### passuk 7
<b>The service as a gift.</b> I have given it to you <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>as a gift.

### passuk 8
<b>Behold, I have given you.</b> With joy. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This term denotes joy, as in, “behold, he is going out to meet you, and when he sees you, he will rejoice in his heart.” This is compared to a king who gave a property to his intimate friend, but did not write and sign a deed, or register it with the authorities. Someone came and claimed the property. The king said to him: “Whoever wishes will come and claim against you. Behold, I will write and sign a deed to you, and register it with the authorites.” Here, too, because Korach came and claimed the <i>kehunah</i> from Aharon, Scripture <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>presents him with twenty-four <i>kehunah</i> gifts, with the eternal covenant of salt. This is why this chapter was placed here. 
<b>The guarding of my <i>terumah</i>-gifts.</b> Which you must <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>guard in ritual purity.
<b>For consecration.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>For greatness.

### passuk 9
<b>From the fire.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>After the burning of the fire.
<b>[Of] all their sacrifices.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>For example, the communal <i>shelamim</i>-offerings. 
<b>Their <i>minchah</i>-offerings, their sin-offerings, and their guilt-offerings.</b> As the plain meaning indicates. 
<b>Which they return to Me.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This refers to the proselyte’s stolen property.

### passuk 10
<b>You shall eat it in the supremely holy.</b> This teaches that the supremely holy offerings <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>may be eaten only in the Sanctuary courtyard, and by the male <i>kohanim.</i> 

### passuk 11
<b>Their <i>terumah</i>-gift.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Which was set aside from the thanksgiving-offering, the peace- offering, and the ram of the nazarite. 
<b>Of all of the wave-offerings.</b> Since these require waving.
<b>All those ritually pure.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>But not those ritually defiled. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Another interpretation of “all those ritually pure” — to include his wife.

### passuk 12
<b>Their <i>terumah</i>-gift.</b> This refers to the major <i>terumah</i>-gift. 

### passuk 13

### passuk 14

### passuk 15

### passuk 16

### passuk 17

### passuk 18
<b>Like the breast which is waved and like the right thigh.</b> Of the peace-offering, which are eaten by the <i>kohanim,</i> and their wives, children, and servants, for two days and one night. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The firstborn [animal], also, is eaten for two days and one night. 
<b>It shall be yours.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>R’ Akiva came, and expounded: Scripture adds an additional “being,” so that you should not say, “like the breast and thigh of the thanksgiving-offering, which is only eaten for a day and a night.” 

### passuk 19
<b>All of the sacred <i>terumah</i>-gifts.</b> Because this <i>parashah</i> is precious, it is generalized at the beginning, generalized at the end, and detailed in between. 
<b>An eternal covenant of salt.</b> He made a covenant with Aharon with a robust, enduring object which invigorates others. 
<b>A covenant of salt.</b> Like the covenant made with salt, which never spoils. 

### passuk 20
<b>And you will not have a share among them.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Even in the spoils. 

### passuk 21

### passuk 22

### passuk 23
<b>They.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The Levites will bear the sins of the Israelites, since it is incumbent upon them to warn unauthorized persons against approaching them. 

### passuk 24
Which they must set aside to Hachem as a <i>terumah</i>-gift. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Scripture calls it “a <i>terumah</i>-gift” until he separates the <i>terumah</i> of the tithe from it.

### passuk 25

### passuk 26

### passuk 27
<b>Your terumah-gift will be considered the same as grain from the granary.</b> The <i>terumah</i> of your tithe is prohibited to unauthorized persons and to the ritually unclean, and they are liable to the death penalty, and to the additional fifth, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>like the major <i>terumah</i>- gift, which is called the first portion of grain from the granary. 
<b>And [wine and oil of] fully ripened fruit from the cistern.</b> The <i>terumah</i>-gift of wine and oil taken from the cisterns.
<b>Fully ripened fruit (lit. full).</b> The term denotes ripeness. Full produce.
<b>Cistern.</b> This refers to the pit before the press, wherein the wine flows. The word יֶקֶב always denotes an excavation of earth. Similarly, “the king’s cisterns,” referring to the sea of Okiyanus, an excavation dug by the King of the universe. 

### passuk 28
<b>So must you, too, set aside.</b> Just as the Israelites set aside from their granaries and cisterns, so must you, too, from your tithe, since that is your inheritance. 

### passuk 29
<b>From all of your gifts you must set aside all of the terumah-gifts of Hachem.</b> Scripture speaks of <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>major <i>terumah,</i> [teaching] that if the Levite pre-empted the <i>Kohen</i> at the storage bin, and received his tithes before the <i>Kohen</i> took the major <i>terumah</i> from the storage bin, the Levite must first set aside one fiftieth of the tithe as major <i>terumah,</i> and then return and set aside the <i>terumah</i> of the tithe. 

### passuk 30
<b>When you set aside the finest part of it.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>After you set aside the <i>terumah</i> of the tithe from it.
<b>It will be considered.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>What remains for the Levites [will be considered] completely secular.
<b>Like the produce of the granary.</b> To the Israelite. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>So that you should not say, since the Torah calls it “<i>terumah,</i>” as it is said, “for the Israelites’ tithe which they set aside for God as a <i>terumah</i>-gift,” perhaps it is completely forbidden. The Torah therefore teaches, “It will be considered, for the Levites, like the produce of the granary.” Just as that of the Israelite is secular, so is that of the Levite secular. 

### passuk 31
<b>Anywhere.</b> Even in the cemetery.

### passuk 32
<b>You will not bear a sin because of it, etc.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Hence, if you do not set aside, you will bear a sin. 
<b>And you will not die.</b> Hence, if you profane, you will die.
