<b>(Make for yourself.</b> So that they they may sound the trumpet before you like a king, as it is said, “There was a king among the righteous.” 
<b>Make for yourself.</b> From your own resources.
<b>Make for yourself.</b> You shall make them and use them, but no one else.) 
<b>To summon the congregation.</b> When you want to speak with the Sanhedrin or the rest of the people, and you summon them to gather before you, summon them with the trumpets. 
<b>And to initiate the departure of the camps.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>At the time of the camps’ departure, sound them as a signal. Consequently, you say that they departed on the basis of three [initiatives]. By the word of the Holy One, Blessed is He; by the word of Moshe; and by the trumpets. 
<b>Beaten.</b> From a [single] ingot you should make it, by beating [it] with a hammer. 

### passuk 3
<b>When they will blow them.</b> Both of them. This is the signal for summoning the community, as it is said, “The entire community shall present itself to you at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.” 

### passuk 4
<b>But if they blow one of them.</b> This is the signal for summoning the leaders, as it is said, “The leaders shall present themselves to you.” <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>They, too, meet at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This is derived by Scriptural comparison in Sifri. 

### passuk 5
<b>When you blow a <i>teruah.</i></b> The signal for the camps to depart; <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i><i>tekiah, teruah</i> <i>tekiah.</i> This is how it is extrapolated by Sifri from the redundant passages. 

### passuk 6

### passuk 7
<b>But when gathering the congregation, etc.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Since it says, “they shall be used by you, to summon the congregation and to initiate departure of the camps” — [we derive that] just as, when summoning the community, the trumpeting is by two <i>kohanim</i> with both [trumpets], as it is said, “they shall trumpet with them, etc . . .” so, when initiating the camps’ departure, with both. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Perhaps, just as, when initiating the camps’ departure, they sound the <i>tekiah, teruah,</i> and <i>tekiah,</i> so, too, when summoning the community, they sound the <i>tekiah, teruah,</i> and <i>tekiah,</i> thus leaving no differentiation between summoning the community and initiating the camps’ departure? The Torah therefore teaches, “But when gathering the congregation, etc. . .” to say that there is no <i>teruah</i> for gathering the community. The same rule applies for the leaders. Here is a synopsis for all three: summoning the community with two, that of the leaders with one. Each of these has no <i>teruah.</i> Initiating the camps’ departure with two, through the <i>teruah</i> and <i>tekiah.</i> 

### passuk 8
<b>The sons of Aharon . . . shall sound.</b> For those summonings and departures.

<b>For your burnt — offerings.</b> Scripture speaks <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>of the communal offerings. 
<b>I am Hachem your God.</b> From here we learn [that we combine Hachem’s] Majesty, remembrance, and the <i>shofar,</i> as it is said, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>”You shall blow” — hence the <i>shofar,</i> “as a remembrance” — this is remembrance, “I am Hachem your God” — this is Majesty, etc. 

### passuk 11
<b>In the second month.</b> Thus you say that they spent <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>twelve months minus ten days at Chorev, since on the first of the month of Sivan they encamped there and did not depart until the twentieth of Iyar the following year. 

### passuk 12
<b>On their journeys.</b> According to the rules specified for the journeying of their banners — who was first, and who last. 
<b>In the desert of Paran.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Kivros Hata’avoh was in the desert of Paran. That is where they camped <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>after this journey.

<b>The Mishkon was dismantled.</b> When the banner of Yehudah was departing, Aharon and his sons entered, dismantled the <i>paroches,</i> and covered the Ark with it, as it says, “Aharon and his sons shall enter when the camp is about to travel.” The sons of Gershon and the sons of Merori dismantled the <i>Mishkon</i> and loaded it onto the wagons [and traveled]. The Ark and the sacred vessels carried by the sons of Kehat remain covered, placed on poles, until the banner of the camp of Reuven departed. Afterward, “The Kehat family traveled.”

<b>Carriers of the sacred.</b> Carriers of the sacred objects.
<b>They erected the Mishkon.</b> The sons of Gershon and the sons of Merori, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>who were preceded by <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the departure of two banners, would erect the <i>Mishkon</i> when the Cloud rested. The signal for making camp was observed by the banner of the camp of Yehudah. They camped while the sons of Kehat still traveled behind with the two final banners. The sons of Gershon and the sons of Merori would erect the Sanctuary, so that when the sons of Kehat arrived, they found it set in place, and brought in the Ark, Table, Menorah, and Altars. This is the sense of the passage: “They — the <i>Mishkon’s erectors — erected it before the arrival of the sons of Kehat.”

<b>The gatherer for all the camps.</b> Talmud Yerushalmi [teaches]: Because the tribe of Don was heavily populated, they traveled last. If anyone lost property, it would return it to them. There is an opinion that <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>they traveled in the shape of a box, derived from, “Just as they camped, so they traveled.” <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Another opinion is that they traveled in the shape of a beam, derived from “The gatherer for all the camps.”

<b>These are the journeys.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This is the order of their journeys. 
<b>They journeyed.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>On that day, they journeyed. 

### passuk 29
<b>Chovav.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This was Yisro, as it is said, “Of the children of Chovav, the father-in-law of Moshe.” Then why does the Torah say, “They came to their father, Reuel”? This teaches that children call their grandfather “father.” He had many names. “Yisro” [lit. “additional”] because he added a chapter to the Torah; “Chovav” [lit. “one who cherishes”] because he cherished the Torah, etc . . . 
<b>We are journeying to the place.</b> Immediately. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Within three days, we enter the [holy] land. Because at this first journey, they traveled with the intention of entering Eretz Yisroel, but they sinned with the complainers. But why did Moshe include himself with them? Because the decree was not yet issued against him, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>and he thought he would enter. 

### passuk 30
<b>To my land and to my birthplace.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Whether for the sake of my properties, or for the sake of my family. 

### passuk 31
<b>Please do not forsake.</b> נָא is a term indicating nothing but request, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>so that they will not say Yisro did not convert out of devotion. He thought that proselytes receive a portion of the land [but] now that he saw that they do not receive a portion, he left them and went on his way. 
<b>For, because you know of our encampment in the desert.</b> For it is appropriate for you to do this, because you know of our encampment in the desert, and you saw the miracles and mightiness done for us. 
<b>For, because you know.</b> Like עַל אֲשֶׁר יָדַעְתָּ, “because” you know, as in כִּי עַל כֵּן, for, “because” I did not give her to my son Shelah, כִּי עַל כֵּן, for, “because” you passed by, כִּי עַל כֵּן, for, “because” they came, כִּי עַל כֵּן, for, “because” I saw your face. 
<b>You will be our eyes.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Past tense, as Targum [Onkelos] renders. Another interpretation: <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Future tense. [Should] anything [be] concealed from our eyes, you shall enlighten our eyes. Another interpretation: You shall be as precious to us as the pupils of our eyes, as it is said, “You shall love the proselyte.” 

### passuk 32
<b>It shall be that the very good (lit. that good).</b> What good did they bestow upon him? They said: “When the Israelites divided the land there was <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>a fertile area of Yericho, five hundred <i>amos</i> by five hundred <i>amos,</i> which they left undivided.” They said: “The one in whose portion the Temple would be built would take it.” In the interim, they gave it to the children of Yisro, to Yonadav, the son of Rechav, as it is said, “The sons of Keini, Moshe’s father-in-law, went up from the city of the dates, etc . . .” 

### passuk 33
<b>A journey of three days.</b> Three days’ traveling distance, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>they traveled in one day, because the Holy One, Blessed is He, wanted to bring them into the land immediately. 
<b>The Ark of the Covenant of Hachem traveled in front of them a journey of three days.</b> This was the Ark which <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>went with them to war, in which the broken Tablets were placed. It preceded them by three days’ travel to prepare a camping place for them. 

### passuk 34
<b>The Cloud of Hachem was above them.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Seven Clouds are recorded during their journeys; Four on four sides, one above, one below, and one preceding them, to lower the highlands, raise the lowlands, and to kill snakes and scorpions. 
<b>From the camp.</b> From their camping place.

### passuk 35
<b>Whenever the Ark departed.</b> Scripture placed symbols before and after this [chapter] to teach <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>that this is not its place. Why, then, was it written here? In order to intervene <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>between one punishment and the next . . . etc., as stated in “all the sacred scriptures.” 
<b>Rise, Hachem.</b> Because He (Hachem) preceded them by three days’ travel, Moshe would say, ‘Rise and wait for us, do not go further away.’ Midrash Tanchuma, Vayakhel. 
<b>May Your enemies disperse.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Those gathered together.
<b>Those who hate You flee.</b> These are the pursuers.
<b>Those who hate You.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>These are the haters of Yisroel, since all those who hate Yisroel hate the One who spoke, and the world came into being, as it is said, “those who hate You have raised [their] heads” — who are they? — “Against Your people they counsel cunningly.” 

### passuk 36
<b>Come to rest, Hachem.</b> Menachem interprets this as a term meaning rest. Similarly, “with rest and calm you will be saved.” 
<b>[Among] the myriads and thousands of Israel.</b> This informs us that the Divine Presence does not rest among the Israelites when there are fewer than <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>twenty-two thousand.
