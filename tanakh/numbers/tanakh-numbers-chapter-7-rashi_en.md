<b>It came to pass, on the day Moshe finished.</b> The text reads כַּלּוֹת . On the day that the <i>Mishkon</i> was erected, the Israelites were like a כַּלָּה — a bride entering the wedding canopy. 
<b>Moshe finished.</b> Bezalel, Aholiav, and all the wise — hearted men constructed the <i>Mishkon,</i> yet Scripture credits it to Moshe, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>because he utterly dedicated himself to it, observing the structural design of each object as shown to him on the mountain (Sinai) in order to instruct the artisans, without making a single error in design. We find a similarity with regard to [king] David, because he utterly dedicated himself to the construction of the Beis Ha Mikdash — as it is said: “Remember, Hachem, unto David all his afflictions; how he swore to Hachem . . . etc. it was, therefore, called by his name, as it is said: “Observe your House, David.” 
<b>[On the day] Moshe finished erecting.</b> It does not say, “On the day [Moshe] erected . . .” This teaches that throughout the seven days of installation Moshe erected and dismantled it, and on that day, he erected it without dismantling it. This is why it says, “On the day Moshe finished erecting” — that day his erecting ended. It was the first of the month of Nisan. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>On the second, the [red] cow was burned, on the third, they sprinkled with the first sprinkling, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>and on the seventh, [after having been sprinkled again] they were shaven. 

### passuk 2
<b>They were the leaders of the tribes.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>They were officers over them in Egypt, and were beaten because of them, as it is said: “And the officers of the Israelites were beaten, etc.” 
<b>They stood by during the counting.</b> They stood with Moshe and Aharon when they counted [Bnei] Yisroel, as it is said, “with you [Moshe and Aharon], shall be. . .” 

### passuk 3
<b>Six covered wagons.</b> צָב can only mean “covered.” Similarly, “[They will bring your brothers from all the nations . . . with horses and chariots] וּבַצַּבִּים וּבַפְּרָדִים,” “in covered wagons and on mules . . .” Covered wagons are called צַבִּים . [Some interpret צָב in the sense of הַצְבִי יִשְׂרָאֵל, (“The finest in Israel.”) They (the wagons) were fine looking.] 
<b>They placed them before the Mishkon.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Because Moshe did not accept [the gift] from their hands until [so] instructed by the omnipresent [God.] R’ Noson said, “Why did the leaders see fit to contribute here at the outset, but for the materials of the <i>Mishkon,</i> they did not contribute at the outset? Because the leaders said as follows: “Let the community contribute as they wish, and any shortfall, we will furnish.” But when they saw that the community had supplied everything, as it is said, “the material was sufficient,” they said, “Now what can we do”? They brought the onyx stones, and the stones set into the <i>ephod and breastplate. This is why they contributed here at the outset. </i>

<b>According to their work.</b> The load of the sons of Gershon was lighter than that of the sons of Merori, who carried the planks, pillars, and sockets. 

### passuk 8

### passuk 9
<b>Because the sacred work was [incumbent] on them.</b> The carrying of sacred objects — the ark, table, etc. Therefore, “they had to carry [them] on their shoulders.” 

### passuk 10
<b>The leaders brought forward the [offerings for] the consecration of the altar.</b> After they contributed the wagons and cattle to carry the <i>Mishkon,</i> they were ennobled to contribute the offerings for the altar to consecrate it. 
<b>The leaders placed their offering before the altar.</b> Because <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Moshe did not accept [the gift] from their hands until [so] instructed by the Almighty. 

### passuk 11
<b>They shall bring forth their offering for the dedication of the altar.</b> But Moshe still did not know how they were to bring the offerings — whether in order of their birth, or in order of the traveling — until the Holy One, Blessed is He, told him that they should bring the offerings according to the traveling, each in his day. 

### passuk 12
<b>On the first day.</b> That day took ten crowns; [it fell on] the first [day] of creation, first of the leaders, etc., as recorded in Seder Olam. 
<b>Of the tribe of Yehudah.</b> Scripture establishes his tribal kinship; <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>but not that he solicited [payment] from his tribe and then brought [the offering]. But perhaps I should say לְמַטֵּה יְהוּדָה, “for the tribe of Yehudah,” [teaching] that he solicited payment from his tribe and then brought [the offering]? The Torah therefore teaches “this is Nachshon’s offering.” He brought his own. 

### passuk 13
<b>Both were filled with fine flour.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>As a voluntary meal-offering.

### passuk 14
<b>[Of] ten gold [<i>shekolim</i>].</b> As Targum [Onkelos] interprets, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the weight of ten <i>shekolim</i> by the Sanctuary standard was in it. 
<b>Filled with incense.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>We do not find incense [brought] by an individual, nor [brought] on the outer altar, except for this one alone. This was a temporary injunction. 

### passuk 15
<b>One [young] bull.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The best of its herd. 

### passuk 16
<b>One he-goat as a sin-offering.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>To atone for [defilement by passing over] the grave of the abyss — [for] indefinite defilement.

### passuk 17

### passuk 18
<b>Nesanel the son of Tzu’ar brought forward — he brought forward his offering.</b> What does the Torah teach [by saying] “he brought forward” with respect to the tribe of Yissachar, without having said it with respect to all the [other] tribes? Because Reuven came with a complaint, saying ‘Enough that Yehudah preceded me! Let me bring my offering after him.’ Moshe said to him, By the Almighty ‘It was told to me that they should bring the offerings in the order of the journeys, according to their banners.’ This is why it says אֶת קָרְבָּנוֹ “ הִקְרִב,” without the “<i>yud</i>,” inferring הַקְרֵב, “you shall bring forward!” — the imperative usage, since Moshe was commanded by the Almighty, “ הַקְרֵב .” What is [the inference of] “[Nesanel] brought forward,” [“he brought forward”] twice? Because there were two reasons by which he merited bringing his offering second among the tribes. One, because of their (his tribe’s) knowledge of Torah, as it is said, “From the sons of Yissachar, of sagacious, timely knowledge.” And one, because they advised the leaders to donate these offerings. In R’ Moshe Hadarshan’s commentary I found: “R’ Pinchos ben Yair said: ‘Nesanel the son of Tzu'ar offered this advice.”’ 

### passuk 19
<b>Silver tray.</b> Its letters are numerically equivalent to <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>930, corresponding to the years of Adam. 
<b>Its weight was one hundred thirty [<i>shekolim</i>].</b> Alluding that when he (Adam) fathered progeny to sustain the world, he was one hundred thirty years old, as it is said: “Adam lived one hundred thirty years, and fathered . . . etc.” 
<b>One silver bowl.</b> The numerical value is 520, alluding to Noach, who fathered his progeny at the age of 500, and alluding to the 20 years by which the decree for the flood preceded his progeny, as I explained [the verse] “His days shall be a hundred and twenty years.” This is why it says מִזְרָק אֶחָד כֶּסֶף, but does not say מִזְרַק כֶּסֶף אֶחָד, as it says concerning the tray — to teach that the letters of אֶחָד are also included in the calculation. 
<b>Seventy shekolim.</b> Corresponding to the 70 nations which emerged from his (Noach’s) sons.

### passuk 20
<b>One spoon (lit. hand).</b> Corresponding to the Torah, which was given from the hand of the Holy One, Blessed is He. 
<b>Ten gold [shekolim].</b> Corresponding to the ten commandments.
<b>Filled with incense.</b> The numerical value of קְטֹרֶת, is 613, corresponding to the 613 commandments — provided you convert the קו"ף into a דל"ת, by using א"ת ב"ש ג"ר ד"ק . 

### passuk 21
<b>One [young] bull.</b> Corresponding to Avraham, concerning whom it is said: “He took a young bull.” 
<b>One ram.</b> Corresponding to Yitzchak, “He took the ram.” 
<b>One [yearling] sheep.</b> Corresponding to Yaakov: “Yaakov separated the sheep.”

### passuk 22
<b>Goat.</b> To atone for the sale of Yossef, concerning whom it is said: “They slaughtered a goat.” 

### passuk 23
<b>For the peace-offering sacrifice, two oxen.</b> Corresponding to Moshe and Aharon, who made peace between the Israelites and their Father in heaven. 
<b>Rams, goats, sheep.</b> Three species, corresponding to <i>kohanim,</i> Levites and Israelites, and corresponding to the Torah, the Prophets, and the Sacred Scripture. Three fives, corresponding to the five <i>chumashim</i> [of the Torah], to the five commandments written on the one tablet, and five commandments written on the other. Until here, [my remarks are] from the commentary of R’ Moshe Hadarshan. 

### passuk 24
<b>On the third day, the leader etc.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>On the third day, the leader who brought the offering was from the sons of Zevulun, and so with all of them. But with Nesanel, concerning whom it is said, “Nesanel brought forth,” the proper succeeding words are “leader of Yissachar,” since it has already mentioned his name and that he brought. With the others, about whom it does not say “he brought,” the proper words are these: “the leader of the children of so-and-so,” that day, the leader who brought was from the tribe of so-and-so.

<b>On the day it was anointed.</b> On the very day it was anointed, he (each leader) brought the offering. Then how do I justify “after it was anointed”? [To teach] That it was anointed first, and then he brought the offering. But, perhaps “after it was anointed” [means] after a time, and “on the day it was anointed” merely teaches that it was anointed by day? When it says “on the day they were anointed,” we learn that it was anointed by day. Then why does the Torah write “on the day it was anointed”? <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>On the day it was anointed, he brought the offering. 
<b>Twelve silver trays.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>These were the very ones that were donated, none were disqualified. 

### passuk 85
<b>One hundred thirty [shekolim was the weight of] each tray.</b> Why does the Torah say this? Because it said “one hundred thirty [<i>shekolim</i> was] its weight,” but does not explain <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>by which <i>shekel</i> standard. Therefore, Scripture repeats it here, and includes everything — “all the silver of the vessels” — in the <i>shekel</i> of the sacred standard. 
<b>All the silver vessels, etc.</b> This teaches you that the Sanctuary vessels were weighed with <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>precision. Whether weighed individually or collectively, there was neither excess nor shortfall. 

### passuk 86
<b>Twelve golden spoons.</b> Why is this said? Because it says, “one spoon of ten gold,” [meaning] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>it was golden, and it weighed ten silver <i>shekolim</i>. But perhaps [it means] one silver spoon, weighing ten golden <i>shekolim</i> — and the golden <i>shekolim</i> are not the same weight as the silver ones? — The Torah therefore writes “golden spoons” — they (the spoons) were gold. 

### passuk 87

### passuk 89
<b>When Moshe would enter.</b> When two passages conflict, a third decides between them. One passage says: “God spoke to him from the Tent of Meeting” — this was outside the <i>paroches</i> partition. And one passage says: “I will speak to you from above the cover [of the Ark].” This [passage] comes and decides between them. Moshe came to the Tent of Meeting. There he heard the Voice coming from above the cover. <b>Between the two cherubs.</b> The Voice emanated from heaven to the space between the two cherubs, and from there to the Tent of Meeting. 
<b>He would hear the Voice.</b> Perhaps the Voice was low (of a lesser degree)? The Torah therefore writes אֶת הַקּוֹל, “the Voice” — the Voice spoken to him at Sinai. But when it reached the doorway, it ceased, and did not go out of the tent. 
<b>Being spoken.</b> As being spoken unto Itself. It is respectful to the One above to speak thusly. He was speaking to Himself, and Moshe was listening in. 
<b>He spoke to him.</b> This excludes Aharon from the communications.
