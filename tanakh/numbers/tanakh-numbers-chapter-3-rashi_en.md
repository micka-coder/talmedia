<b>These are the descendants of Aharon and Moshe.</b> [Scripture] mentions only the sons of Aharon, yet they are called the descendants of Moshe — because he taught them Torah. This teaches us that one who teaches another’s son Torah is considered as having procreated him. 
<b>On the day that Adonoy spoke to Moshe</b> They became his descendants, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>since he taught them what he had learned from the mouth of the Almighty.

### passuk 6
<b>And they shall serve him.</b> What is the service? [The next passage explains —] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>”They shall preserve his guardianship;” since he (Aharon) is obligated to guard the Sanctuary so that no stranger may approach, as it is said, “. . . you (Aharon), your sons, and your father’s house with you shall bear [responsibility for] the sin of [defiling] the Sanctuary . . .,” and these Levites aided them, this is the service. 

### passuk 7
<b>They shall take care to preserve his guardianship.</b> Any position to which a person is appointed which requires his active management is called a “watch” throughout Scripture, and in the Mishnaic idiom, as stated concerning Bigsan and Seresh, “But surely my watch is not similar to yours”? Similarly, the “watches” of the <i>kohanim</i> and Levites. 

### passuk 8
<b>And the watch of Bnei Yisroel.</b> They were all actually obligated to provide the needs of the Sanctuary; the Levites merely served in their place, as surrogates. This is why they (the Levites) accepted the tithes from them, in payment, as it is said, “. . . for it (the tithe) is your payment, in return for your service . . .” 

### passuk 9
<b>They are presented to him.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>For assistance.
<b>From [among] Bnei Yisroel</b> This [מֵאֵת, “from”] is understood as מִתּוֹךְ, “from among” Bnei Yisroel, meaning <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>from the rest of the entire congregation they (the Levites) were selected for this by Divine decree and He (God) gave them to him (Aharon), as it is said, “I (God) have given the Levites, given [them] . . .” 

### passuk 10
<b>Appoint Aharon and his sons.</b> The word connotes appointment, not counting. 
<b>And they shall guard their priesthood.</b> Referring to the blood [of the sacrificial offerings], sprinkling [it on the altar], burning [the sacrifices], [and other] services entrusted to the <i>kohanim.</i> 

### passuk 11

### passuk 12
<b>Behold, I have taken [the Levites].</b> What is My right to them? <b>From among Bnei Yisroel</b> That the Israelites must hire them to serve Me? Through the [Israelites’] first born, I gained my right to them, having taken them (the Levites) in their place. Because the sacred service was [originally performed] by the firstborn, but when they sinned with the golden calf, they were disqualified. The Levites, who did not indulge in idolatry, were chosen instead. 

### passuk 13

### passuk 15
<b>From the age of one month and above.</b> When he (the infant) can no longer be categorized as stillborn, he is listed among those entitled “guardian of the sacred watch.” R’ Yehudah B’rabi Shalom said, “This [Levite] tribe is regularly counted from the womb, as it is said, “. . . [Yocheved, Levi’s daughter] . . . whom she (Levi’s wife) bore to Levi in Egypt . . .” While entering the portals of Egypt, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>she bore her (Yocheved). yet she is counted among the seventy souls [who came down to Egypt]. for, when one tallies their total, one finds only sixty-nine and she completed the total. 

### passuk 16
<b>According to the word of Adonoy.</b> Moshe said before the Holy One, Blessed is He, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>”How can I enter into their tents to determine the number of their nursing infants”? The Holy One, Blessed is He, replied, “Do yours, and I will do Mine”! Moshe proceeded, and stood at the door of the tent, whereupon the Divine Presence preceded him [and entered the tent]. A voice then echoed from the tent, announcing, “There are so many and so many nursing infants in this tent”! This is why it is said, “. . . according to the word of God . . .”

<b>The families of the children of Kehos shall camp . . . on the south.</b> Near them [was] the banner of Reuven, who camped to the south. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Woe to the wicked, woe to his neighbor! This is why [Reuven’s constituents] were punished — Doson, Avirom, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>and two hundred and fifty men — together with Korach and his assembly, because they (the Reuvenites) were drawn, with them, into the dispute.

<b>Moshe, Aharon and his sons.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Near them [was] the banner of the camp of Yehudah, and those who camped near him, Yissachar and Zevulun. Good fortune to the righteous, good fortune to his neighbor! Because they were neighbors of Moshe, who engaged in Torah [study], they became great Torah scholars, as it is said, “Yehudah my lawgiver”; “From the sons of Yissachar of sagacious knowledge, etc.” — [this refers to] two hundred heads of Sanhedrin; “and from Zevulun, came those that handle the scribe’s quill.” 

### passuk 39
<b>Whom Moshe and Aharon counted.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>There are dots over [the word] וְאַהֲרֹן, to teach that he was not included in the counting of the Levites. 
<b>Twenty two thousand.</b> When counting them individually, however, one discovers three hundred extra: the sons of Gershon, seven thousand five hundred; the sons of Kehos, eight thousand six hundred; the sons of Merori, six thousand two hundred [hence, twenty two thousand three hundred]. Why aren’t they included among the rest to redeem the firstborn, thus exempting the two hundred seventy three overlapping firstborn from redemption? Our sages answered, in Maseches Bechoros, that the three hundred Levites were, themselves, firstborn. It was sufficient <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>for them to release themselves from redemption. 

### passuk 40
<b>Count every male firstborn . . . from the age of one month and above.</b> When he (the infant) can no longer be categorized as stillborn.

<b>And the animals of the Levites . . .etc.</b> The animals of the Levites did not redeem the firstlings of the Israelites’ clean (i.e., kosher) animals, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>but [they did redeem] the firstlings of their donkeys. And a single sheep belonging to a Levite released numerous of the Israelites’ donkey firstlings. The proof is that Scripture counts the extra men, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>but did not count the extra animals. 

### passuk 46
<b>And the redemption of the [two hundred and seventy-]three.</b> The firstborn who require redemption among them (the Israelites), these are the two hundred seventy-three extras among them, over and above the Levites. From them, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>take five <i>shekolim</i> per head. This was the sale price for Yoseif, twenty silver [pieces], who was Rochel’s firstborn.

<b>[Those whose numbers were] in excess of those who were redeemed through the Levites.</b> Those redeemed by the very presence of the Levites.

### passuk 50
<b>One thousand three hundred sixty five.</b> This is the sum total, [at] five <i>shekolim</i> per head. For two hundred firstborn: one thousand <i>shekolim.</i> For seventy firstborn — three hundred and fifty <i>shekolim.</i> For three firstborn — fifteen <i>shekolim.</i> He (Moshe) said, “How shall I do this? Any firstborn whom I tell to pay five <i>shekolim</i> will say, ‘I am from those redeemed by the Levites”’! What did he do? He brought <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>twenty-two thousand slips and wrote “Levite” on them, and two hundred and seventy three slips and wrote “five <i>shekolim</i>” on them. He mixed them together, and placed them in a container. [Then] he told them, “Come, choose your slips by lot.”
