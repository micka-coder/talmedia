<b>These are the journeys.</b> Why were these journeys recorded? To make the Omnipresent’s benevolence known. For, although He decreed to move them about and cause them to wander in the wilderness, do not say that they wandered and were moved about from journey to journey all forty years, and had no rest — for there are only forty two journeys here. Subtract fourteen, all of which took place during the first year, before the decree, from their journey from Ra’meses until they reached Rismah, from where the spies were dispatched, as it is said, “after, the people journeyed from Chatzeros, etc. Send, for yourself, men, etc.,” and here it says, “they journeyed from Chatzeros and camped at Rismah,” <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>you learn that it was in the desert of Paran. Exclude, further, from there, eight journeys which took place after Aharon’s death, from Mount Hor to the plains of Moav, during the fortieth year, it is found <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>that throughout the thirty eight years, they took only twenty journeys. This is from R’ Moshe [Hadarshan]’s commentary. R’ Tanchuma <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>expounds the matter differently: This is compared to a king whose son was ill, and he brought him to a distant place for treatment. When they returned, the father began enumerating all the journeys. He said to him, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>”Here, we slept; here, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>we were chilled; here, your head ached, etc.’

<b>The Cannanite heard.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This teaches you that the death of Aharon was the news he heard that the clouds of glory had departed, and he (the Canaanite) thought that it was permissible to wage war against the Israelites. This is why Scripture repeats it.

<b>When you cross the Yardein, etc. You must drive out, etc.</b> Were they not admonished several times concerning this? But this is what Moshe said to them: “When you cross the Yardein on dry land, you must cross on this condition, and if you do not, the waters will come and inundate you.” We find that Yehoshua spoke to them similarly while they were still in the Yardein.
