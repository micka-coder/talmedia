<b>Aside from the atonement sin-offering.</b> The goat offered in the inner chamber, mentioned in “Acharei Mos.” It, too, was a sin- offering. 
<b>And the constant (daily) burnt- offering</b> And <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>aside from the constant burnt- offering, you shall offer these burnt-offerings. 
<b>And their libations.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This relates to the <i>musaf</i>-offerings stated above, and to “you shall offer.” <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>It denotes a command: ‘Aside from the constant burnt-offering and its <i>minchah,</i> you shall offer these and their libations.’ It is the same with every “their libations” said at all the festivals, except those concerning the [<i>Succos</i>] holiday sacrifices. Every “and its libation,” “and their libations,” “and its libations” among them refer to the constant sacrifice, and are not commands, since the <i>musaf</i> libations are written separately for each day.

<b>Their meal-offerings and their libations for the bulls.</b> There were seventy festival bulls, representing the seventy nations, which were progressively diminishing, symbolizing their destruction. During the time of the Sanctuary, [however,] These sacrifices shielded them from suffering. 
<b>And the lambs.</b> Representing Israel, which is called “the dispersed lamb.” Their numbers are constant, and they total ninety eight, to nullify the ninety eight curses in Mishneh Torah. On the second day, וְנִסְכֵּיהֶם, “and their libations,” is said, in relation to the day’s two constant-offerings. The change in language was intended for exposition, as the Rabbis, of blessed memory, remarked: On the second day, וְנִסְכֵּיהֶם, “and their libations,” is said, on the sixth, וּנְסָכֶיהָ, “and her libations,” on the seventh, כְּמִשְׁפָּטָם, “according to ‘their’ requirement.” מ"ם, יו"ד, מ"ם . which spells מַּיִם, “water,” and is an allusion that the water libation, during the Festival is Scriptural.

<b>Shall be a [day of] restraint for you.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Restraint from doing work. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Another interpetation [of] restraint, restrain yourselves from leaving. This teaches that they were required to remain overnight. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>According to the Aggadic Midrash, because, throughout the entire holiday, they brought offerings which represented the seventy nations. When they were going to leave, the Omnipresent said to them, ‘I request of you, make a small repast for me, so that I may enjoy your company.’

<b>One young bull, one ram.</b> These <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>represent Yisroel [which is singular to the Holy One, Blessed is He] — ‘Remain with Me a little longer’. This denotes affection, as when children take leave of their father, and he says to them, ‘Your departure distresses me, remain yet another day’. This is compared to a king who made a repast, etc., as stated in tractate Succah. Midrash R’ Tanchumah interprets: The Torah teaches <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>proper conduct. Someone who entertains a guest should, on the first day, feed him fattened fowl, the next day fish, the next beef, the next day he should feed him grains, and the next, vegetables. Progressive diminishment, like the festival bulls.

<b>These you shall make to Adonoy on your festivals.</b> Those things designated <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>as obligations.
<b>Aside from your vows.</b> If you should decide to vow offerings during the holiday, this will be credited to you as a commendable act. Or, the vows and gifts which you pledged throughout the year, bring during the holiday, as it may be difficult for you to make the return pilgrimage to Jerusalem to offer up your pledges, and you may thus ultimately violate the prohibition of “. . .do not delay [fulfilling your pledge].”
