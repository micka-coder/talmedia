<b>And if the yoveil occurs.</b> From here <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>R’ Yehudah said that <i>yoveil</i> is destined <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>to discontinue.
<b>And if the <i>yoveil</i> occurs.</b> As if to say, this is not a sale, which reverts on <i>yoveil</i>, for an inheritance does not revert on <i>yoveil.</i> So even if <i>yoveil</i> occurs, the inheritance will not revert to its tribe, and will thus be added to the inheritance of the tribe into which they marry.
