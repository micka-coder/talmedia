<b>When you light.</b> Why is the <i>parshah</i> of the Menorah adjacent to the <i>parshah</i> of the leaders? Because when Aharon saw the leaders’ dedication (offerings) he was humiliated, since he did not join them in the dedication, neither he nor his tribe. The Holy One, Blessed is He, said to him, “By your life, yours is greater than theirs! For you will light and cleanse the lamps.” 
<b>When you light (lit. cause to rise).</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Because the flame rises, igniting is described in terms of “rising.” He is required to ignite [the lamp] until the flame rises by itself. In addition, the Rabbis derive from here <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>that there was a platform before the Menorah, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>upon which the <i>kohein</i> stood when he lit [the lamps]. 
<b>Toward the face of the Menorah.</b> Toward the middle lamp which was not on one of the branches, but on the Menorah itself. 
<b>Shall the seven lamps cast [their] light.</b> The six [lamps] that were on the six branches [and one on its stem]. The three eastern ones turned toward the middle [by] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>their wicks. Similarly, the three western ones — the heads of their wicks [were] towards the middle. Why? So that it whould not be said that He (God) needs the light. 

### passuk 3
<b>Aharon did so.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>To indicate his [Aharon’s] virtue — he did not digress. 

### passuk 4
<b>This is how the Menorah was made.</b> The Holy One, Blessed is He, showed him (Moshe) by pointing [as one would point] with the finger, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>since he had difficulty with it. This is why it says וְזֶה (“This”). 
<b>Beaten.</b> <i>Batedic</i> (hammered) in Old French, meaning the same as דָּא לְדָא נָקְשָׁן, (“they struck one another”). There was a <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>lump of gold, [weighing] a <i>kikar,</i> [which] he beat with a hammer and cut with <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>shears to extend its (the Menorah’s) limbs properly; but it was not made limb by limb and [then] connected. 
<b>From its base until its flowers.</b> Its base was the hollow box over the legs, hollowed like the silver candelabras before princes. 
<b>From its base until its flowers.</b> As if to say, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>”The Menorah proper, in its entirety, and all its dependent parts.” 
<b>From its base.</b> Which was a large limb.
<b>Until its flowers.</b> Its most <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>delicate work — it was all one piece. עַד (“until”), is customarily used in this sense, like “From the harvested crop, until the standing grain, and until the olive grove.” 
<b>According to the vision which [Adonoy] showed . . . </b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>According to the form which He showed him on the mountain (Sinai), as it is said: “Observe and make them according to the form. . .etc.” 
<b>So he made the Menorah.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The one who made it. But Midrash Aggadah [states] by the Holy One, Blessed is He, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>it was made spontaneously.

<b>Take the Levites.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Take them with words of persuasion, “you are fortunate to merit becoming servants of the Omnipresent.” 

### passuk 7
<b>Sprinkle them with the sin-offering waters.</b> Of the ashes of the red cow, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>for some of them were defiled by contact with the dead. 
<b>And cause a razor to pass.</b> I found in R’ Moshe Hadarshan’s remarks: “Because they were given in atonement for the firstborn <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>who practiced idolatry, which is referred to as ‘sacrificing to the dead,’ and since the leper is considered dead, they required shaving like lepers.” 

### passuk 8
<b>They should take a young bullock.</b> This was a burnt-offering, as it is written, “he should make . . . one a burnt-offering.” This is the communal sacrifice for idolatry. 
<b>And a second bullock.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>What does the Torah teach [by specifying] ‘a second’? To inform you that, just as the burnt-offering was not eaten, so was the sin-offering not eaten. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This supports his remarks, from Toras Kohanim. Now I say <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>that it was a temporary ruling, as they should have brought a goat as a sin-offering for idolatry with the burnt-offering bull. 

### passuk 9
<b>And you shall gather the entire congregation</b> Since the Levites are given as an atonement-offering in their place, let them come <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>and stand near their offering and rest their hands on them. 

### passuk 10

### passuk 11
<b>Aharon shall wave the Levites as a wave-offering</b> Just as the leper’s guilt- offering <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>requires waving when it is still alive. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Three wavings were stated in this chapter: The first, of the sons of Kehos. Therefore it is stated of them: “They will be [entrusted] to do the worship of Adonoy,” since the work of the holiest is upon them — the Ark and the Table etc. The second, of the sons of Gershon. It is therefore stated of them: “A wave-offering to Adonoy,” for even they were entrusted with holy work — tapestries and the hooks which were seen in the Holy of Holies. And the third, of the sons of Merori.

<b>For every first born is Mine.</b> The first born were Mine by the rules of justice, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>since I protected them among the Egyptian firstborn. So I took them for Myself — until they strayed with the [golden] calf. Now I have taken the Levites. 

### passuk 18

### passuk 19
<b>I have given the Levites, etc.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Bnei Yisroel are mentioned five times, in this passage, to make their preciousness known. They are remembered repeatedly in a single passage to correspond with the number of the five books of the Torah. I saw this in Bereishis Rabbah. 
<b>So that there will not be a plague among Bnei Yisroel.</b> So that they will not need <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>to approach the Holy, for if they approach, there will be a plague. 

### passuk 20
<b>Moshe, Aharon, and the entire congregation did, etc.</b> Moshe placed them, Aharon waved them, and <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the Israelites rested their hands.

### passuk 22
<b>Just as Adonoy commanded, etc. so they did.</b> This indicates the praiseworthiness of those who did, and those with whom it was done — <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>no one objected. 

### passuk 23

### passuk 24
<b>This concerns the Levites.</b> Age disqualifies them, but physical deformity does not disqualify them. 
<b>From the age of twenty-five.</b> But elsewhere it says, “From the age of thirty.” How is this reconciled? From the age of twenty-five he begins to study of the laws of the service. He studies for five years, and serves at the age of thirty. From here [we derive] that a pupil who does not see <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>favorable indications in his studies for five years will never see (them). 

### passuk 25
<b>And shall no longer work.</b> At the task of carrying <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>on the shoulder, but he returns to lock the gates, to sing, and to load the wagons. This is [the meaning of] “But he shall serve <i>his</i> brethren,” ‘<i>with</i> his brethren’, as Targum [Onkelos] renders. 

### passuk 26
<b>To keep the watch.</b> To camp around the Tent, and erect and dismantle [it] during the journeys.
