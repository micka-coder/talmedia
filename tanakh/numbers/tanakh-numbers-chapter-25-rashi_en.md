<b>In Shittim.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This was its name. 
<b>Acting promiscuously with the daughters of Moav.</b> As a result of Bil’am’s advice, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>as stated in “Chelek.” 

### passuk 2
<b>And prostrated themselves before their gods.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>When he was overcome by lust, and asked her to submit to him, she drew a statue of Pe’or from her bosom toward him and said, ‘Prostrate yourself before this’! 

### passuk 3
<b>Pe’or.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Because they bared, their buttocks before it and relieved themselves — this is the way it was worshipped. 
<b>The rage of Hachem flared against Yisroel.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>He sent a plague on them.

### passuk 4
<b>Take all the leaders of the people.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>To pass judgement on those who worshipped Pe’or.
<b>And hang them.</b> The worshippers.
<b> וְהוֹקַע .</b> This refers to hanging, as we find concerning the sons of Shaul, “and let us hang them for [the sake of] God.” and there, hanging is specified, idolatry is [punished] with stoning, and <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>all those stoned are hung. 
<b>Facing the sun.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>In full public view. Midrash Aggadah: The sun identifies the sinners. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The cloud rolls back from the area above him, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>and the sun shines on him. 

### passuk 5
<b>Each of you must execute his men.</b> Each of the Israelite judges executed two men, and there were eighty eight thousand Israelite judges, as stated in Sanhedrin. 

### passuk 6
<b>Behold, a man came from among Bnei Yisroel.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The tribe of Shimon gathered around Zimri, who was their leader, and said to him, “We are being sentenced to death, and you sit by, etc.,” as stated in “Eilu Hein Hanisrafin.” 
<b>The Midianite woman.</b> Kozbi, daughter of Tzur. 
<b>Before the eyes of Moshe.</b> They said to him, “Moshe, is she forbidden or permitted? If you say ‘forbidden,’ <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>who permitted the daughter of Yisro to you? etc.” as stated there. 
<b>Who were weeping.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The <i>halachah</i> was concealed from him [that anyone having relations with a gentile woman is to be executed by the zealous], so they all burst into tears. At the golden calf, Moshe stood against six hundred thousand, as it is said, “he ground it into powder, etc.,” yet here he was enfeebled? But this was in order that Pinchas might come and take what was appropriately his. 

### passuk 7
<b>Pinchas. . .saw.</b> He saw the incident <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>and remembered the <i>halachah.</i> He said to Moshe, “I received from you [the teaching] that anyone having relations with a gentile woman is to be <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>executed by the zealous.” He replied to him, “Let the one who reads the correspondence serve as its executor.” Instantly, “he took a spear in his hand, etc.” 

### passuk 8
<b> אֶל הַקֻבָּה .</b> Into the tent.
<b>Through her belly.</b> As in “the jaws and the uterus.” He struck precisely at Zimri’s male organ and her female organ, so everyone saw that he did not kill them needlessly. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Many miracles were performed for him, etc., as stated there. 

### passuk 9

### passuk 10

### passuk 11
Pinchas the son of Elozor, the son of Aharon the Kohen. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Because the tri es disparaged him, [saying] ‘Have you seen that son of “Puti,” whose mother’s father fattened calves for idol worship, and <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>who murdered the chieftain of a tribe of Israel?’ Therefore, Scripture traces his lineage to Aharon. 
<b>By his vengeance for Me.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>By avenging My vengeance — by his rage where I should have been enraged. קִנְאָה always denotes someone <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>enflamed to avenge something. <i>Enportment,</i> “flaming anger,” in Old French. 

### passuk 12
<b>My covenant [of] peace.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>To be a covenant of peace for him like a man who harbors <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>gratitude and favor towards someone who benefitted him. Here, too, the Holy One, Blessed is He, expressed to him His peace. 

### passuk 13
<b>It shall be.</b> To him — <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>this covenant of Mine.
<b>A covenant of eternal kehunah.</b> Although the <i>kehunah</i> had already been given to Aharon’s descendants, it was given <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>solely to Aharon and his sons who were annointed with him, and to their generations who would be borne after their annointment. Pinchas, however, who was born before, and was not annointed, was not included in the <i>kehunah</i> until here. Similarly, we learned in Zevachim, ‘Pinchas was not rendered a <i>Kohen until he killed Zimri.’ </i>
<b>For his God.</b> For the sake of his God, like הַמְקַנֵּא אַתָּה לִי, “are you zealous ‘for’ me?” and קִנֵּאתִי לְצִיּוֹן, “for the sake of Tzion.” 

### passuk 14
<b>The name of the Israelite man, etc.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Where he mentions the relationship of the saint for praise he mentions the relationship of the wicked for shame. 
<b>Leader of a paternal house of Shimon.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Of one of the five paternal houses of the tribe of Shimon. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Another interpretation: To proclaim the merit of Pinchas. Although this one was a leader, he did not refrain from avenging the desecration of the Name [of God]. This is why Scripture informs you of the identity of the one who was killed. 

### passuk 15
<b>The name of the slain woman, etc.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>To inform you of the hatred of the Midianites, who abandoned a princess to promiscuous behavior in order to entice the Israelites into sinning. 
<b>The national leader.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>One of the five kings of Midian, “Evi, Rekem, Tzur, etc.” He was the most prominent of all of them, as it is said, “the national leader,” <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>but because he debased himself by abandoning his daughter, he is counted third. 
<b>Of a paternal house.</b> There were five paternal houses in Midian, Eiphah, Eipher, Chanoch, Avidah, and Eldoah. This one was the king of one them. 

### passuk 16

### passuk 17
<b>Antagonize.</b> Like זָכוֹר, “remember,” שָׁמוֹר,”keep,” meaning ongoing action. It is incumbent upon you to act with hostility toward them. 

### passuk 18
<b>For they antagonized you, etc., in the matter of Pe’or.</b> Since they abandoned their daughters to promiscuity <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>in order to cause you to stray after Pe’or. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>However, He did not order the destruction of Moav, Because of Rus [Ruth], who was destined to emanate from them, as we state in Bava Kama.
