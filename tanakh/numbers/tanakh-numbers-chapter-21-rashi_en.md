<b>The Canaanite heard.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>He heard that Aharon died, and the clouds of glory departed, etc. as stated in Rosh Hashanah. Amelek was always a whip for disciplining Israel, prepared, at all times, to mete out punishment. 
<b>Who lived in the south.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This was Amalek, as it is said, “Amelek dwells in the southern part of the land.” They changed their language, and spoke in the Canaanite tongue, so that the Israelites would pray to the Holy One, Blessed is He, to deliver the Canaanites into their hands —but they were not Canaanites. The Israelites saw that they were dressed in Amalekite clothing, but spoke the Canaanite tongue. They said, “let us pray in a general way,” as it is said, “if you will deliver this people into my hand.” 
<b>By the route of the spies.</b> The negev route traveled by the spies, as it is said, “they went up to the negev.” Another interpretation of דֶּרֶךְ הָאֲתָרִים ; the route of <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the great pathfinder which traveled before them, as it is said, “[the Ark of the covenant of God traveled before them] three days’ journey, to seek out a resting place for them.” 
<b>He took from them a captive.</b> It was only <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>one maidservant.

### passuk 2
<b>I shall consecrate.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>I shall consecrate the spoils to heaven. 

### passuk 3
<b>And he destroyed them.</b> By execution.
<b>And [consecrated] their cities.</b> He consecrated them to heaven.

### passuk 4
<b>By the Reed Sea route.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Since Aharon had died, and this war fell upon them, they turned back to the Reed Sea route This was the route by which they had turned back when the decree of the spies was issued against them, as it is said, “travel into the desert, by the Reed Sea route.” Here, they turned back seven journeys, as it is said, “Bnei Yisroel journeyed from Be’eiros Bnei Yaakan to Moseirah. There, Aharon died.” Was it in Moseirah that Aharon died? Did he not die at Mount Hor? <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>But they returned there, and mourned and eulogized him as if he were in their presence. Go, examine the journeys, and you will find seven journeys from Moseirah to Mount Hor. 
<b>To circle around the land of Edom.</b> Since they did not permit them to pass through their land.
<b>Traveling was insufferable to the people (lit. “the people’s souls did not have the capacity for traveling”).</b> Because of the rigors of travel, which were overly difficult for them. They said, “We were just close to entering the land, and we are turning back. This was how our fathers turned back, and they remained for thirty-eight years, until this day.” Therefore, the distress of traveling was insufferable. “<i>Encrot lor</i>” [“repulsive to them”, in old French]. But it would be improper to translate “the people experienced insufferability בַּדֶּרֶךְ, while traveling,” without specification of the cause of the insufferability; since, wherever one finds insufferability in Scripture, the cause is specified. For example, “they were insufferable to me.” And, for example, “Israel’s distress was insufferable to him.” Anything overly difficult for a person is depicted as קִצּוּר נֶפֶשׁ (lit. the incapacity of the soul), like a person beset by travail, who lacks the breadth of mind to accept that, and who does not have a place in his heart where the distress might reside. Now, the thing causing distress is depicted as looming large, since it is seems large and weighs heavily on the person. For example, “their souls loomed over me” —seemed large to me. [And, for example,] “Trapping me like a lion looms large.” The synopsis of the interpretation: Every statement expressing the soul’s incapacity for a thing means that it cannot tolerate it, for the mind cannot tolerate it. 

### passuk 5
<b>Against God and Moshe.</b> They equated the servant with his master.
<b>Why did you bring us up.</b> Both of them, equally. 
<b>We (our souls) are disgusted.</b> This, too, denotes insufferability and disgust. 
<b>With this rotten bread.</b> Because the manna was absorbed into the limbs, they called it rotten. They said, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>“the manna will eventually swell in our stomachs. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Can anyone born of a woman take in [food] without excreting? 

### passuk 6
<b>The consuming (lit. burning) snakes.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>That consume a man with the venom in their fangs.
<b>And they bit the people.</b> Let the snake, who was smitten for speaking wickedly, come and punish those who spoke wickedly. Let the snake, for whom every type [of food] tastes the same, come and punish the ingrates, for whom one thing changed to numerous tastes. 

### passuk 7
<b>Moshe prayed.</b> From here we derive that someone from whom forgiveness is asked should not be mercilessly unpardoning.

### passuk 8
<b>Upon a banner.</b> On a pole, called “<i>perche</i>” in old French. Similarly, “like a banner on the hill,” “I shall lift my banner,” “raise the banner.” <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Because it is held high as a signal and as verification, it is called נֵס . 
<b>Anyone bitten.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Even if a dog or donkey bit him, he would sicken and <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>deteriorate steadily, except that the snakebite killed quickly. This is why it says here “. . . who saw it” — at a glance. But regarding the snakebite, it says “. . . he gazed,” “. . . if a snake bit a man, he gazed, etc.,” as the snakebite was not quick to heal unless he gazed at it with concentration. The Rabbis said, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>”Can a snake bring death or life? Rather, when the Israelites gazed heavenward and subjugated their hearts to their Father in heaven, they would heal, but if not, they would waste away.” 

### passuk 9
<b>A copper snake.</b> He was not told to make it of copper, but Moshe said: “The Holy One, Blessed is He, called it “ נָחָשׁ “ <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>(“snake,”) so I shall make it of “ נְחֹשֶׁת “ (“copper”). The terminology is well matched. 

### passuk 10

### passuk 11
<b>In the wasteland passes.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>I do not know why they were called עִיִּים (“wasteland”). עִי denotes desolation, [like] something swept clean <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>with a broom. Only the עַיִ''ן is the root. It has the same meaning as יָעִים (“scoops”), and as וְיָעָה בָרָד (“hail shall sweep away”). 
<b>Passes.</b> This was the passage route <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>for those crossing Mount Nevo into the land of Canaan. It (Mount Nevo) separated the territory of Moav from the land of the Emorites.
<b>Facing Moav, eastward of the sun.</b> East of the land of Moav. 

### passuk 12

### passuk 13
<b>From the Emorite border.</b> The boundary, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the edge of their border. Similarly, “the border of Moav”, meaning the edge, the end. 
<b>Opposite Arnon.</b> They circled the entire southern and eastern territory of Moav, until they reached the other side, at Arnon, inside Emorite territory, north of Moav. 
<b>Extending from the Emorite border.</b> A strip extends from the Emorite border, and it belongs to the Emorites, but penetrates the boundary of Moav until Arnon, the Moavite border. The Israelites camped there without entering the border of Moav, Arnon being the Moav border, and they did not grant them permission to pass through their land. Although Moshe did not state this clearly, Yiftach did, as was said by Yiftach, “he (Moshe) also sent [a request] to the king of Moav, but he was unwilling.” Moshe alluded to this: “Just as they did to me, the children of Eisav, who dwell in Seir, and the Moavites, who dwell in Ar,” Just as these [children of Eisav] did not permit them to pass through their land, but they circled around them, so it was with Moav. 

### passuk 14
<b>Concerning this will be told.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Concerning this encampment, and the miracles performed in it. <b>Will be told in the Book of Wars of Hachem.</b> When they recount the miracles performed for our forefathers, they will recount that “He gave, etc.” 
<b>He gave.</b> Like אֶת יָהֵב . Just as we transpose יָעֹד into וָעֹד, we also transpose וָהֵב into יָהֵב, the וָי"ו being basic. As if to say, “that He gave them, and wrought many miracles at the Reed Sea.” 
<b>And the valleys of Arnon.</b> Just as we recount the miracles of the Reed Sea, so should we recount the miracles of the valleys of Arnon, since here, too, great miracles were wrought. What are the miracles? 

### passuk 15
<b>The spillage in the valleys.</b> The Targum of שֶׁפֶךְ (“spillage,”) is אֶשֶׁד . The spillage in the valleys [was as follows]— the blood of the Emorites spilled there, as they were hidden there. Because there were high cliffs, with a deep, narrow valley. The cliffs were near each other— a man could stand on one of them, and converse with a friend on the other— and the road went through the valley. The Emorites said, “When the Israelites enter the valley to pass through, let us go out of the caves in the cliffs above them, and kill them with arrows and stone projectiles.” Now those cavities were in the mountain on the Moavite side, and in the mountain on the side of the Emorites, opposite the cavities, were horn-like projections, resembling breasts. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>When the Israelites came to pass through, the Eretz Yisroel mountain was set in tremor like a maidservant going forth to receive her mistress, and moved next to the mountain on the Moavite side. The breasts entered the cavities and killed them. this is [the meaning of] “when it turned to dwell at Ar,” as the mountain leaned away from its place, and moved next to the side of the Moavite border, and attached itself to it. And this is [the meaning of] “and then leaned on the border of Moav.” 

### passuk 16
<b>From there, to the well.</b> From there, the spillage came to the well. How was this? The Holy One, Blessed is He, said, “Who will inform My children of these miracles?” The parable says, ‘if you gave the baby bread, tell his mother.’ After they passed, the mountains returned to their places, and the well descended to the valley, and brought up, from there, the blood of those who were killed, and their arms and limbs, and carried them around the camp. The Israelites saw, and sang. 

### passuk 17
<b>Arise, O well.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>From within the valley, and lift what you are to bring up. How do we know that the well informed them? As it is said, “from there to the well.” <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Was it from there? Was it not with them at the beginning of the forty years? But, it descended to make the miracles known. Similarly, “then, Yisroel sang this song” was said at the end of forty years, but the well was given to them at the beginning of the forty years. Why was it seen fit to have been written here? Only because this subject is expounded in relation to the above text. 

### passuk 18
<b>The well dug [by princes].</b> This is the well dug by the princes, Moshe and Aharon. 
<b>With their staffs.</b> With the rod.
<b>From the wilderness.</b> It was given to them.

### passuk 19
<b>After it was given, it became a legacy.</b> As rendered by Targum [Onkelos]. 

### passuk 20
<b>From the heights to the valley in the field of Moav.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>As there Moshe died, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>and there the well was discontinued. Another interpretation of “The nobles of the nation excavated”: Each tribal leader, when they encamped, took his staff and drew it to his banner and camp. The well water followed the path made by that mark, and reached each the camp of each tribe. 
<b>Through the lawgiver.</b> Through Moshe, who was called the lawgiver, as it is said, “for there, the portion of the lawgiver is reserved.” <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Why is Moshe not mentioned in this song? Because he was afflicted through the well. And since Moshe’s name is not mentioned, the Name of the God, is not mentioned. This is compared to a king who was invited to a banquet. he said, ‘If my intimate friend is there, I will be there, but if not, I will not go.’ 
<b>At the top of the peak.</b> As Targum [Onkelos] translates, “the top of the height.” 
<b>The peak.</b> This denotes a high point. Similarly, פַּסְּגוּ אַרְמְנוֹתֶיהָ —”raise its castles.” 
<b>That overlooks.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>That peak, facing the place called Yeshimon. The word [Yeshimon] denotes a wilderness, a desolate place. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Another interpretation: The well may be seen on the face of the desolate place. It (the well) was hidden in the sea of Teveriah, and someone standing on the desolate place may look intently and observe a type of sieve in the sea— this is the well. This was expounded by R’ Tanchuma. 

### passuk 21
<b>Yisroel sent emissaries.</b> But elsewhere, the communication is attributed to Moshe, as it is said, “I sent emissaries from the eastern wilderness.” Similarly, “Moshe sent emissaries from Kadesh to the king of Edom”, but about Yiftach it says, “Israel sent emissaries to the king of Edom, etc.” These passages are mutually instructive, one closes, while the other opens. Moshe is Yisroel, Yisroel is Moshe, to teach you that the leader of the generation is like the entire generation. The leader is everything. 

### passuk 22
<b>Let me pass through your land.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Although they were not commanded to offer a peace overture, they made a peaceful proposal. 

### passuk 23
<b>Sichon did not allow, etc.</b> Since all the Canaanite kings <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>delivered tribute to him, for he protected them from armies passing through against them. When Yisroel said to him, “Let me pass through your land,” he said, “My very presence here is to protect them from you, and you say this”? 
<b>And [he] went out against Israel.</b> If Cheshbon had been filled with gnats, no creature could have conquered it. And if Sichon had been in a feeble village, no man could have conquered him, And certainly, since he was in Cheshbon. The Holy One, Blessed is He, said, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>”Why should I incovenience My children with all this besieging of every single city”? He prompted all the warriors into deciding to leave the cities, and they all gathered in one place, where they were slain. From there, the Israelites went to the cities without opposition, since no one was there, except the women and children. 

### passuk 24
<b>Because [the border] was impregnable.</b> What was its strength? The admonishment by The Holy one, Blessed is He, who said to them, “do not oppress them, etc.” 

### passuk 25
<b>Its daughters.</b> The villages nearby. 

### passuk 26
<b>He had waged war.</b> Why was it necessary for this to have been written? Because it is said, “do not oppress Moav,” and Cheshbon belonged to Moav. Scripture [therefore] writes, for us, that Sichon confiscated it from them, and it was purified for Israel through him. 
<b>From his hand.</b> From his possesion.

### passuk 27
<b>Concerning this.</b> Concerning this war fought by Sichon against Moav.
<b>The parable tellers say.</b> Bil’am, of whom it is said, “he set forth his parable.”
<b>The parable tellers.</b> Bil’am and Beor. They said:
<b>Come to Cheshbon.</b> Since Sichon was unable to conquer it, he hired Bil’am to curse it. This is why Balak said to him, “for I know that what you bless is blessed, etc.” 
<b>May it be built and established.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Cheshbon, under Sichon’s name, to be his city. 

### passuk 28
<b>For, a fire went forth from Cheshbon.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>After Sichon conquered it. 
<b>It consumed Ar, of Moav.</b> The name of that country is called “Ar” in the Hebrew language, and “Lechayas” in the Aramaic language. 
<b>Ar, of Moav.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Ar, belonging to Moav. 

### passuk 29
<b>Woe to you, O Moav.</b> They cursed Moav <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>that he be delivered into his hands. 
<b>Kemosh.</b> The name of the Moavite deity.
<b>He rendered.</b> Whoever rendered, “his sons”—Moav’s. 
<b>Refugees.</b> Who fled and escaped the sword, and his daughters into captivity, etc. 

### passuk 30
<b>Their kingdom was uprooted.</b> [וַנִּירָם is translated as] their kingdom.
<b>Was uprooted from Cheshbon, as far as Divon.</b> The kingdom and authority Moav had in Cheshbon, was uprooted from there. Similarly, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>”as far as Divon.” The Targum of סָר, “was removed,” is עַד . As if to say, the kingdom was removed from Divon. נִיר denotes monarchy, authority, a man’s power, Similarly, “so that the monarchy shall remain with My servant David.” 
<b>We made them desolate.</b> The שִׁ"ין is punctuated, denoting desolation. This is what the parable tellers said: וַנַּשִּׁים אוֹתָם עַד נֹפַח, “We made them desolate until Nofach.” 

### passuk 31

### passuk 32
<b>Moshe sent [men] to spy on Ya’zer.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The spies captured it. They said, we will not act like the first ones; We have [enough] faith, in the power of Moshe’s prayer, to do battle. 

### passuk 33

### passuk 34
<b>Do not be afraid of him.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Moshe was afraid to do battle, for perhaps, the merit of Avrohom, would stand for him [Og] as it is said, “the one who had escaped came.” This was Og, who escaped, of the Rephaim whom Kedorlaomer and his cohorts smote in Ashteros Karnayim, as it is said, “for only Og, king of Bashan, was left of the remaining Rephaim.” 

### passuk 35
<b>They killed him.</b> Moshe killed him, as stated in Berachos, in [the chapter of] Haroeh. He uprooted a mountain three <i>parsaos</i> long, etc.
