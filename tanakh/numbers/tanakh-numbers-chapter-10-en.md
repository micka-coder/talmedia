### passuk 2
’Make thee two trumpets of silver; of beaten work shalt thou make them; and they shall be unto thee for the calling of the congregation, and for causing the camps to set forward.

### passuk 3
And when they shall blow with them, all the congregation shall gather themselves unto thee at the door of the tent of meeting.

### passuk 4
And if they blow but with one, then the princes, the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto thee.

### passuk 5
And when ye blow an alarm, the camps that lie on the east side shall take their journey.

### passuk 6
And when ye blow an alarm the second time, the camps that lie on the south side shall set forward; they shall blow an alarm for their journeys.

### passuk 7
But when the assembly is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm.

### passuk 8
And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to you for a statute for ever throughout your generations.

### passuk 9
And when ye go to war in your land against the adversary that oppresseth you, then ye shall sound an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before the LORD your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies.

### passuk 10
Also in the day of your gladness, and in your appointed seasons, and in your new moons, ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt-offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace-offerings; and they shall be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the LORD your God.’
