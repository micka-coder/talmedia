### passuk 2
<b>If . . . sets apart.</b> Sets [himself] apart. Why is the chapter of the nazirite placed next to the chapter of the <i>sotah</i>? To tell you <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>that whoever observes a <i>sotah</i> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>in her decadence should take the <i>nazirite</i> vow against wine, which leads to promiscuity. 
<b>A nazirite vow.</b> נְזִירָה always indicates abstinence. Here, too, he abstains from wine. 
<b>To set [himself] apart for Hachem.</b> To separate himself from wine for the sake of heaven.

### passuk 3
<b>From new or old [intoxicating] wine.</b> As Targum [Onkelos] translates; “from new wine or old”: <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Wine intoxicates when aged.
<b>Anything steeped in grapes.</b> The word [מִשְׁרַת] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>denotes adding color to water, or any beverage. In the Mishnaic idiom, there are many [examples]: ‘One does not steep ink or dye’, ‘If a nazirite steeped his bread in wine’. 

### passuk 4
<b>Seeds.</b> These are the kernels.
<b>Skin.</b> These are the outer shells in which the seeds are [held] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>like the tongue of a bell. 

### passuk 5
<b>He shall be sacred.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>His hair, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>for growing the growth of hair on his head. 
<b>Long.</b> This is vocalized with <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>a <i>small patach</i> (<i>segol</i>), even though it is attached to “the hair of his head” — the growth of hair. The meaning of פֶּרַע is “growth of hair.” Similarly, “He (the <i>Kohen gadol</i>) shall not permit the growth of hair on his head.” It is not considered a פֶּרַע (growth) [if uncut] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>less than thirty days. 

### passuk 6

### passuk 7

### passuk 8
<b>All the days of his separation, he is sacred.</b> This refers to personal sanctity, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>from defilement [by contact] with the dead. 

### passuk 9
<b>Suddenly.</b> This refers to the unavoidable.
<b>[Or] unexpectedly.</b> This refers to the unintentional. Some say פֶּתַע פִּתְאוֹם is a single statement, [meaning] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>”a sudden incident.” 
<b>If someone died near him.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>In the tent where he was.
<b>On the day of his purification.</b> On the day <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>when he is sprinkled. Or, perhaps only the eighth [day], when he is completely purified? The Torah therefore states, “on the seventh day.” If the seventh, perhaps even if he was not sprinkled? The Torah therefore states, “on the day of his purification.” 

### passuk 10
<b>On the eighth day he shall take two turtledoves.</b> This excludes the seventh [day]. Or perhaps it is intended to exclude the ninth [day]? [Scripture] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>designated a time for the offerings, and designated a time for those who bring them. Just as the offerings are sanctioned on the eighth, and from the eighth and onward, so [are] those who bring them [sanctioned] on the eighth, and from the eighth and onward. 

### passuk 11
<b>From his sin [of contact] with a [departed] soul.</b> He was negligent about defilement with the dead. R’ Elazar Hakapar says, [the sin was] that <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>he inflicted suffering on himself by abstaining from wine. 
<b>He shall sanctify his head.</b> By beginning, again, his nazirite counting. 

### passuk 12
<b>He shall set apart, for Hachem, his nazarite days.</b> He shall repeat the count of his nazarite days as [counted] originally. 
<b>The first days shall elapse.</b> Be discounted.

### passuk 13
<b>He shall bring himself [lit. him].</b> He shall bring himself. This is one of the three usages of אֶת, (literally, “him”), which R’ Yishmael explained this way. Similarly, “They will burden them with sin and guilt. — themselves.” Similarly, “He (Moshe) buried אוֹתוֹ (lit. him) in the valley.” He buried himself. 

### passuk 14

### passuk 15
<b>And their meal-offerings and libations.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Of the burnt-offering and the peace- offering. Because they were included in a group, but then distinguished innovatively, requiring bread, Scripture reinstates them into the group, [stating] that they require libations, following the rule of all burnt and peace-offerings. 
<b>Matzoh loaves [mixed with oil] and matzoh wafers.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Ten of each kind.

### passuk 16

### passuk 17
<b>A peace-offering for Hachem, along with the basket of matzos.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>He shall slaughter the peace-offering with the intent to sanctify the bread. 
<b>His meal-offering and libation.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The ram’s.

### passuk 18
<b>The Nazir shall shave at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.</b> Perhaps he shaves in the courtyard? <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>But this would be grossly disrepectful. Rather, the <i>Nazir</i> shall shave <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>after the slaughter of the <i>shelamim</i>, concerning which is written “. . . and slaughter, it [the peace-offering] at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.” 
<b>Which is under the peace-offering sacrifice.</b> Underneath <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the pot in which he cooks it. Because the <i>Nazir’s</i> peace-offerings <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>were cooked in the courtyard, since the <i>Kohen</i> had to remove the foreleg after it was cooked and wave it before God. 

### passuk 19
<b>The cooked foreleg.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>After it was cooked.

### passuk 20
<b>It is consecrated to the Kohen.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The loaf, wafer, and foreleg are <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i><i>terumah</i>-gifts to the <i>Kohen. </i>
<b>Besides the breast of the wave-offering.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Besides the breast and the shoulder that are due to him from all peace-offerings, there is added to the nazirite peace-offerings, this foreleg. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Because the nazirite peace-offerings were included in a group, but then distinguished innovatively, for the consecration of the foreleg, Scripture must reinstate them into the group and deal, also, with the breast and shoulder. 

### passuk 21
<b>Aside from what he can afford to bring.</b> If he said, “I am hereby a <i>Nazir</i> with the stipulation to shave [my hair] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>relative to a hundred burnt-offerings and a hundred peace-offerings,” [his vow is effective]. According to his vow, that he vows, so shall he fulfill. Added . . . Beyond his nazirite laws. Beyond the nazirite laws. He may <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>increase, but not reduce. If he said, “I am hereby a nazirite five times [consecutively], with the stipulation to shave [my hair] relative to these three animals,” I do not read, concerning him, “whatever he vows, so shall he do.” 

### passuk 22

### passuk 23
<b>Saying.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Like זָכוֹר, “remembering,” שָׁמוֹר, “keeping.” in Old French, “<i>disant</i>” — gerund. 
<b>Saying to them.</b> So that <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>they all hear.
<b>Saying.</b> [אָמוֹר is] Full. Do not bless them with haste and rushing, but with concentration and a whole heart. 

### passuk 24
<b>May . . . bless you.</b> May your possessions be blessed.
<b>And protect you.</b> From thieves descending on you for your money. A person who presents a gift to his servant is unable to protect him from everybody, so if bandits descend on him and take it from him, what benefit does he have from the gift? But the Holy One, Blessed is He, is both giver and protector. There are many homiletic interpretations in Sifri. 

### passuk 25
<b>May Hachem cause His countenance to shine upon you.</b> May he show you a joyous, radiant countenance. 
<b>And favor you.</b> May he grant you favor.

### passuk 26
<b>May Hachem lift his face to you.</b> May he subdue his anger.

### passuk 27
<b>They shall bestow My Name.</b> They shall bless them with the explicit Name [of God]. 
<b>And I will bless them.</b> The Israelites. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>I will concur with [the blessing of] the <i>kohanim.</i> Another interpretation [of] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>”And I will bless them” — The <i>kohanim.</i>
