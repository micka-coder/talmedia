### passuk 1
<b>Behold I send My angel</b> to put the wicked away.
<b>and he will clear a way</b> of the wicked.
<b>the Lord Whom you seek</b> The God of justice.
<b>and the angel of the covenant</b> who avenges the revenge of the covenant.

### passuk 2
<b>Now who can abide</b> This is synonymous with; וּמִי יָכִיל
<b>and who will stand</b> Will be able to stand.
<b>and like fullers’ soap</b> Like soap used by the fullers, which removes the entire stain. So will he remove all the wickedness. <b>and like soap</b> It is an herb which removes stains, erbe savonijere in Old French, probably soapwort. The word בֹּרִית signifies a thing that cleans and purifies, as in (Ps. 73:1), “to the pure of heart.”

### passuk 3
<b>And he shall sit refining</b> He will free himself from all his affairs to be like a refiner, who refines and purifies silver.

### passuk 4

### passuk 5

### passuk 6
<b>For I, the Lord, have not changed</b> Although I keep back My anger for a long time, My mind has not changed from the way it was originally, to love evil and to hate good.
<b>and you, the sons of Jacob</b> Although you die in your evil, and I have not requited the wicked in their lifetime
<b>you have not reached the end</b> You are not finished from before Me, for I have left over the souls to be requited in Gehinnom. And so did Jonathan render. And you of the House of Jacob, who think that whoever dies in this world, his verdict has already ended, that is to say, you think that My verdict has been nullified, that he will no longer be punished. Our Sages (Sotah 9a), however, explained it: לֹא שָׁנִיתִי - I did not strike a nation and repeat a blow to it; but as for you, I have kept you up after much punishment, and My arrows are ended, but you are not ended.

### passuk 7

### passuk 8
<b>Will a man rob</b> Our Sages explained this as an expression of robbery, and it is an Aramaism.
<b>With tithes and with the terumah levy</b> The tithes and the terumah - levy that you steal from the priests and the Levites is tantamount to robbing Me.

### passuk 9
<b>You are cursed with a curse</b> because of this iniquity, for which I send a curse into the work of your hands; but nevertheless, you rob Me.

### passuk 10
<b>so that there may be nourishment in My House</b> There shall be food accessible for My servants.

### passuk 11
<b>And I will rebuke the devourer for your sake</b> The finishing locusts and the shearing locusts, which devour the grain of your field and your vines.

### passuk 12
<b>a desirable land</b> A land that I desire.

### passuk 13

### passuk 14
<b>“It is futile to serve God”</b> We worship Him for nothing, for we will receive no reward.
<b>in anxious worry</b> with low spirits.

### passuk 15
<b>And now we praise the bold transgressors, etc.</b> We worshipped Him and kept His charge, but now we see that the wicked are prospering - to the extent that we praise them for the wicked deeds.
<b>Yea, they tempt God,</b> saying, “Let us see what He will be able to do to us.” <b>and they have, nevertheless, escaped</b> harm, and they have not stumbled.

### passuk 16
<b>Then the God-fearing men spoke, etc.</b> I retort upon your words then, when the wicked commit evil and the good go about in anxious worry because of Me. The God-fearing men spoke to one another not to adopt their evil deeds; and, as for Me, their words are not forgotten to Me. And although I do not hasten to visit retribution, I have hearkened and heard, and I have commanded that a book of remembrance be written for them. Their words shall be preserved for Me.

### passuk 17
<b>for that day when I make a treasure</b> that I have stored and put away, with which to pay My reward. There I will show you what the difference is between a righteous man and a wicked man.
<b>a treasure</b> a treasure; estouj, estui in Old French.

### passuk 18

### passuk 19
<b>For lo, the sun comes</b> This instance of יוֹם is an expression of sun, for so did the Sages state that there will be no Gehinnom in the future, but the Holy One, blessed be He, will take the sun out of its case; the wicked will be punished thereby and the righteous will be healed thereby. That is the meaning of what is stated (verse 20): “And the sun of mercy shall rise for you who fear My Name, etc.”
<b>neither root nor branch</b> Neither son nor grandson

### passuk 20
<b>and be fat</b> an expression of fat, as in (Jer. 50: 11), “as you become fat, like a threshing heifer.”
<b>as fatted calves</b> [the calves] that enter the team to be fattened; kopla, cople in Old French: animals tied together.

### passuk 21
<b>And you shall crush</b> and you shall press. This is an expression of pressing, similar to (Ezek. 23: 8) “they pressed their virgin breasts.”

### passuk 22

### passuk 23

### passuk 24
<b>that he may turn the heart of the fathers back</b> to the Holy One, blessed be He.
<b>through the children</b> lit., on. He will say to the children affectionately and appeasingly, “Go and speak to your fathers to adopt the ways of the Omnipresent.” So we explain, “and the heart of the children through their fathers.” This I heard in the name of Rabbi Menahem, but our Sages expounded upon it in tractate Eduyoth (8:7), that he will come to make peace in the world.
