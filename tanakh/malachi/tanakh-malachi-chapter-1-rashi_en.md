### passuk 1
<b>The burden of the word of the Lord</b> Porport in Old French, burden. A word delivered to Malachi to bear to the children of Israel.
<b>in the hand of Malachi</b> It was already delivered into his hand for many days. From here, our Sages expounded in a baraitha of Mechilta that all the prophets stood on Mount Sinai and there the prophecies were delivered to them, and so [Isaiah (48:16)] says: “From the time it was, there was I, and now, the Lord God has sent me, [and His spirit].”

### passuk 2
<b>And I loved Jacob</b> And I gave him (Jer. 3:19) “a desirable land, an inheritance of the desire of hosts of nations”; a land that all the hosts of nations desire.

### passuk 3
<b>And I hated Esau</b> to push him off to a land because of Jacob, his brother. Now it is customary in the world that, if one has two sons, he selects a beautiful portion for the firstborn.
<b>and I made his mountains desolate</b> They do not compare to the mountains of Israel.
<b>for the jackals of the desert</b> A den of jackals.

### passuk 4
<b>Should Edom say, “We were poor”</b> And if Edom says, “At first we were poor, but from now on we will be rich from the spoils of Jerusalem.” <b>but we will return and build the ruins</b> Our ruins, so said the Lord, etc.

### passuk 5
<b>“The Lord is great beyond the border of Israel.”</b> He will show His greatness over our border, to make known that we are His people. And Jonathan rendered: May the glory of the Lord be magnified, and He has widened the border of Israel.

### passuk 6
<b>A son</b> is required to honor his father, and so a slave his master and you are called sons and slaves. Now, if I am your father, where is My honor?
<b>says the Lord of Hosts to you</b> You, the priests who despise My Name.
<b>But you said, “How have we despised”</b> I knew that you would say, “How have we despised?” This is the contempt [as follows:]

### passuk 7
<b>You offer on My altar, etc., yet you say</b> And if you say. <b>“How have we defiled You?”</b> How have we defiled for You the bread of Your altar? I reply to you that, in this manner you have defiled Me. <b>By your saying, “God’s table is contemptible.”</b> They would look with contempt on sharing equally the meal offerings and the hallowed foods, and they would say, “Since we may not share a meal offering for a meal offering, or a sacrifice for a sacrifice, it is too much bother and toil to divide each meal offering for the olive-sized piece or the bean-sized piece that is apportioned to each one.”

### passuk 8
<b>is there nothing wrong?</b> Is this thing not bad?

### passuk 9
<b>And now, will you pray before the Lord?</b> And now, you priests, who commit this evil, how does it enter your mind that you can be the messengers of Israel, to supplicate God to have compassion on them? Lo, this evil has come from your hand.
<b>Will He favor any of you</b> to hearken to a prayer from your mouth, and to favor those who sent you?

### passuk 10
<b>O that there were even one among you that would close the doors</b> If only a good man would arise among you who would close the doors of My sanctuary so as not to allow this abominable sacrifice there.
<b>and that you would not kindle fire on My altar in vain</b> with fire offerings with which I am not placated, for I have no desire in you. And our Sages expounded in Torath Kohanim (7: 154): If a person says to his friend, “Close this door for me,” he does not demand compensation for it; [or if he says,] “Light this candle for me,” he does not request compensation for it. But you - who is there among you who closed My doors, gratis? Neither did you kindle fire on My altar gratis. Surely, things that are customarily done for compensation you did not do gratis. Therefore, I have no desire in you.

### passuk 11
<b>My Name is great among the nations</b> Our Sages stated (Men. 110a): For they call Him the God of the gods. Even one who has an idol knows that He is the God Who is over all of them - and everywhere they donate in My Name. Our Sages, however, explained: These are the Torah scholars who are engaged in the laws of the Temple service everywhere, and likewise, every prayer of Israel that they pray anywhere is to Me as a pure oblation. And so did Jonathan paraphrase: And every time that you do My will, I accept your prayer, and My great Name is sanctified through you, and your prayer is like a pure offering before Me. This is the explanation of the verse: Now why do you profane My Name? Is it not great among the nations? As for Me, My love and My affection are upon you wherever you pray before Me, and even in exile, [offerings are] burnt and offered up to My Name.
<b>yea, a pure oblation</b> it is to Me, for through you My Name is feared among the nations. Yet you profane Me and My Name.

### passuk 12
<b>and its expression is “Its food is contemptible.”</b> The expression of the altar that is fluent on your lips is always, “Its food is contemptible”; that [is all] you say about it. You have already spread this slander, and you have strongly attached this expression to My altar.
<b>its food</b> its food.

### passuk 13
<b>And you say, “Here is a weary one”</b> An emaciated animal, and we are poor and cannot afford the choicest for [our] vows. So did Jonathan render: This is what we have brought from our toil.
<b>and you cause it pain</b> This is one of the eighteen words [in all of Scripture known as] the emendations of the scribes. וְהִפַּחְתֶּם אוֹתוֹ should have been written: אוֹתִי, and you cause Me pain. Scripture, however, euphemized, writing אוֹתוֹ it. <b>and you cause pain</b> and you cause pain, an expression of despair (Job 11: 20).
<b>it</b> My table.

### passuk 14
<b>he who deals craftily</b> Plots deceitfully, with guile, before Me, saying, “I have none better than this.”
<b>a ram</b> a ram fit for a burnt offering;
<b>and he vows and sacrifices a blemished one</b> as in (Lev. 22:25), “their corruption is in them; a blemish is in them.”
