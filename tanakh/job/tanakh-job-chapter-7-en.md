### passuk 1
Is there not a time of service to man upon earth? And are not his days like the days of a hireling?

### passuk 2
As a servant that eagerly longeth for the shadow, And as a hireling that looketh for his wages;

### passuk 3
So am I made to possess—months of vanity, And wearisome nights are appointed to me.

### passuk 4
When I lie down, I say: ‘When shall I arise?’ But the night is long, and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.

### passuk 5
My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; My skin closeth up and breaketh out afresh.

### passuk 6
My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, And are spent without hope.

### passuk 7
O remember that my life is a breath; Mine eye shall no more see good.

### passuk 8
The eye of him that seeth me shall behold me no more; While Thine eyes are upon me, I am gone.

### passuk 9
As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away, So he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more.

### passuk 10
He shall return no more to his house, Neither shall his place know him any more.

### passuk 11
Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.

### passuk 12
Am I a sea, or a sea-monster, That Thou settest a watch over me?

### passuk 13
When I say: ‘My bed shall comfort me, My couch shall ease my complaint’;

### passuk 14
Then Thou scarest me with dreams, And terrifiest me through visions;

### passuk 15
So that my soul chooseth strangling, And death rather than these my bones.

### passuk 16
I loathe it; I shall not live alway; Let me alone; for my days are vanity.

### passuk 17
What is man, that Thou shouldest magnify him, And that Thou shouldest set Thy heart upon him,

### passuk 18
And that Thou shouldest remember him every morning, And try him every moment?

### passuk 19
How long wilt Thou not look away from me, Nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?

### passuk 20
If I have sinned, what do I unto Thee, O Thou watcher of men? Why hast Thou set me as a mark for Thee, So that I am a burden to myself?

### passuk 21
And why dost Thou not pardon my transgression, And take away mine iniquity? For now shall I lie down in the dust; And Thou wilt seek me, but I shall not be.
