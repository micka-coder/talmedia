### passuk 1
Then Job answered and said:

### passuk 2
No doubt but ye are the people, And wisdom shall die with you.

### passuk 3
But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you; Yea, who knoweth not such things as these?

### passuk 4
I am as one that is a laughing-stock to his neighbour, A man that called upon God, And He answered him; The just, the innocent man is a laughing-stock,

### passuk 5
A contemptible brand in the thought of him that is at ease, A thing ready for them whose foot slippeth.

### passuk 6
The tents of robbers prosper, And they that provoke God are secure, In whatsoever God bringeth into their hand.

### passuk 7
But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; And the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee;

### passuk 8
Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee; And the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee;

### passuk 9
Who knoweth not among all these, That the hand of the LORD hath wrought this?

### passuk 10
In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, And the breath of all mankind.—

### passuk 11
Doth not the ear try words, Even as the palate tasteth its food?

### passuk 12
Is wisdom with aged men, And understanding in length of days?—

### passuk 13
With Him is wisdom and might; He hath counsel and understanding.

### passuk 14
Behold, He breaketh down, and it cannot be built again; He shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.

### passuk 15
Behold, He withholdeth the waters, and they dry up; Also He sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.

### passuk 16
With Him is strength and sound wisdom; The deceived and the deceiver are His.

### passuk 17
He leadeth counsellors away stripped, And judges maketh He fools.

### passuk 18
He looseth the bond of kings, And bindeth their loins with a girdle.

### passuk 19
He leadeth priests away stripped, And overthroweth the mighty.

### passuk 20
He removeth the speech of men of trust, And taketh away the sense of the elders.

### passuk 21
He poureth contempt upon princes, And looseth the belt of the strong.

### passuk 22
He uncovereth deep things out of darkness, And bringeth out to light the shadow of death.

### passuk 23
He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them; He enlargeth the nations, and leadeth them away.

### passuk 24
He taketh away the heart of the chiefs of the people of the land, And causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.

### passuk 25
They grope in the dark without light, And He maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.
