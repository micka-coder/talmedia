Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said:

### passuk 2
Should a wise man make answer with windy knowledge, And fill his belly with the east wind?

### passuk 3
Should he reason with unprofitable talk, Or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?

### passuk 4
Yea, thou doest away with fear, And impairest devotion before God.

### passuk 5
For thine iniquity teacheth thy mouth, And thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.

### passuk 6
Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I; Yea, thine own lips testify against thee.

### passuk 7
Art thou the first man that was born? Or wast thou brought forth before the hills?

### passuk 8
Dost thou hearken in the council of God? And dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?

### passuk 9
What knowest thou, that we know not? What understandest thou, which is not in us?

### passuk 10
With us are both the gray-headed and the very aged men, Much older than thy father.

### passuk 11
Are the consolations of God too small for thee, And the word that dealeth gently with thee?

### passuk 12
Why doth thy heart carry thee away? And why do thine eyes wink?

### passuk 13
That thou turnest thy spirit against God, And lettest such words go out of thy mouth.

### passuk 14
What is man, that he should be clean? And he that is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?

### passuk 15
Behold, He putteth no trust in His holy ones; Yea, the heavens are not clean in His sight.

### passuk 16
How much less one that is abominable and impure, Man who drinketh iniquity like water! .

### passuk 17
I will tell thee, hear thou me; And that which I have seen I will declare—

### passuk 18
Which wise men have told From their fathers, and have not hid it;

### passuk 19
Unto whom alone the land was given, And no stranger passed among them.

### passuk 20
The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, Even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor.

### passuk 21
A sound of terrors is in his ears: In prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.

### passuk 22
He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, And he is waited for of the sword.

### passuk 23
He wandereth abroad for bread: ‘Where is it?’ He knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.

### passuk 24
Distress and anguish overwhelm him; They prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.

### passuk 25
Because he hath stretched out his hand against God, And behaveth himself proudly against the Almighty;

### passuk 26
He runneth upon him with a stiff neck, With the thick bosses of his bucklers.

### passuk 27
Because he hath covered his face with his fatness, And made collops of fat on his loins;

### passuk 28
And he hath dwelt in desolate cities, In houses which no man would inhabit, Which were ready to become heaps.

### passuk 29
He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, Neither shall their produce bend to the earth.

### passuk 30
He shall not depart out of darkness; The flame shall dry up his branches, And by the breath of His mouth shall he go away.

### passuk 31
Let him not trust in vanity, deceiving himself; For vanity shall be his recompense.

### passuk 32
It shall be accomplished before his time, And his branch shall not be leafy.

### passuk 33
He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, And shall cast off his flower as the olive.

### passuk 34
For the company of the godless shall be desolate, And fire shall consume the tents of bribery.

### passuk 35
They conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity, And their belly prepareth deceit.
