### passuk 1
Howbeit, Job, I pray thee, hear my speech, And hearken to all my words.

### passuk 2
Behold now, I have opened my mouth, My tongue hath spoken in my mouth.

### passuk 3
My words shall utter the uprightness of my heart; And that which my lips know they shall speak sincerely.

### passuk 4
The spirit of God hath made me, And the breath of the Almighty given me life.

### passuk 5
If thou canst, answer thou me, Set thy words in order before me, stand forth.

### passuk 6
Behold, I am toward God even as thou art; I also am formed out of the clay.

### passuk 7
Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, Neither shall my pressure be heavy upon thee.

### passuk 8
Surely thou hast spoken in my hearing, And I have heard the voice of thy words;

### passuk 9
’I am clean, without transgression, I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me;

### passuk 10
Behold, He findeth occasions against me, He counteth me for His enemy;

### passuk 11
He putteth my feet in the stocks, He marketh all my paths.’ .

### passuk 12
Behold, I answer thee: In this thou art not right, That God is too great for man;

### passuk 13
Why hast thou striven against Him? Seeing that He will not answer any of his words.

### passuk 14
For God speaketh in one way, Yea in two, though man perceiveth it not.

### passuk 15
In a dream, in a vision of the night, When deep sleep falleth upon men, In slumberings upon the bed;

### passuk 16
Then He openeth the ears of men, And by their chastisement sealeth the decree,

### passuk 17
That men may put away their purpose, And that He may hide pride from man;

### passuk 18
That He may keep back his soul from the pit, And his life from perishing by the sword.

### passuk 19
He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, And all his bones grow stiff;

### passuk 20
So that his life maketh him to abhor bread, And his soul dainty food.

### passuk 21
His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; And his bones corrode to unsightliness.

### passuk 22
Yea, his soul draweth near unto the pit, And his life to the destroyers.

### passuk 23
If there be for him an angel, An intercessor, one among a thousand, To vouch for a man’s uprightness;

### passuk 24
Then He is gracious unto him, and saith: ‘Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom.’

### passuk 25
His flesh is tenderer than a child’s; He returneth to the days of his youth;

### passuk 26
He prayeth unto God, and He is favourable unto him; So that he seeth His face with joy; And He restoreth unto man his righteousness.

### passuk 27
He cometh before men, and saith: ‘I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, And it profited me not.’

### passuk 28
So He redeemeth his soul from going into the pit, And his life beholdeth the light.

### passuk 29
Lo, all these things doth God work, Twice, yea thrice, with a man,

### passuk 30
To bring back his soul from the pit, That he may be enlightened with the light of the living.

### passuk 31
Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me; Hold thy peace, and I will speak.

### passuk 32
If thou hast any thing to say, answer me; Speak, for I desire to justify thee.

### passuk 33
If not, hearken thou unto me; Hold thy peace, and I will teach thee wisdom.
