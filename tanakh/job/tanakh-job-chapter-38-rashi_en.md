### passuk 1
<b>from the tempest</b> Heb. מן הסערה. Count your hairs and I will give you as many answers. From the tempest with which you reproached Me (above 9:17), “He Who would crush me with a tempest,” I will answer you, as you will hear at the end of the chapter (verse 25), “Who has separated a place for the hair?” a shaft for every hair. Another explanation: With a tempest He afflicted him, and with a tempest He healed him, as is explained in Sifrei(?).

### passuk 2
<b>who gives dark counsel</b> Dark and foolish counsel. Another explanation: Who is this who gives dark counsel...without knowledge? Said the Holy One, blessed be He: Who is this who darkens counsel, frustrates words, i.e., with a multiplicity of words; for I wrote: “and that man was sincere and upright,” at the beginning of the Book, in order that My name should rest on Him, but he came and darkened and frustrated what I counseled with his many words. Whereupon Job replies to Him (below 42:3): “Who is this Who hides counsel?” Had I known Your counsel, I would not have spoken so much. Then the Holy One blessed be He, answers him, “Neither did Abraham know; yet he passed ten” [tests]. So I found.

### passuk 3

<b>When...sing together</b> from the beginning the stars of light.

### passuk 8
<b>the sea with doors</b> The sand, which is its boundary.
<b>when it broke forth</b> Heb. בגיחו, when it broke forth from the deep, like (Ps. 22:10), “that You drew me (גחי) forth from the womb”; drew me forth.

### passuk 9
<b>When I made the cloud</b> around the ocean, which encompasses the world, and clouds encompass it like raiment.
<b>its wrapping</b> Heb. חתלתו, its wrapping, like (Ezek. 16:4), “nor were you swaddled (והחתל לא חתלת).”

### passuk 10
<b>and broke</b> I made breaks in it [the sea] all around to keep it back within them, and they are its boundary, which it shall not pass, as in (Josh 7:5), “and they pursued them until the quarries (השברים)” which are the ditches around the city.

### passuk 11

### passuk 12
<b>In [all] your days</b> From the day you were born.

### passuk 13
<b>To grasp the corners of the earth</b> Moreover, in all your days, did you command [anyone] to grasp the corners of the earth like a man who grasps the corners of a garment and shakes it? So am I destined to grasp it [the earth] by its corners and shake the wicked [out of it]. Likewise, Scripture states (Isa. 31:3): “and the Lord shall turn His hand, and the helper shall stumble,” like a person who, holding something in his hand, drops it by inclining his hand.

### passuk 14
<b>changes</b> in formation.
<b>The seal...like clay</b> The cast of man’s countenance [changes] when he dies, and at the resurrection of the dead they will live again, and they will stand up in their clothing.

### passuk 15
<b>And...shall be withheld</b> then from the wicked their light, and the high arm shall be broken.

### passuk 16
<b>the locks of the sea</b> Heb. נבכי, like (Ex. 14:3), “They are trapped (נבכים) in the land.”

### passuk 17
<b>the gates of death</b> This is Gehinnom.

### passuk 18

### passuk 19

### passuk 20

### passuk 21
<b>You knew</b> all this.
<b>for then you were born</b> when I created (them).

### passuk 22

### passuk 23
<b>That I saved</b> I withheld.
<b>for a time of trouble</b> For the five kings in Gibeon.
<b>for a day of battle</b> The war of Gog and Magog.

### passuk 24
<b>is the light parted</b> The irradiation of the sun, which diverges this way and that way like the horns of a hind.
<b>the eastern one</b> The sun of the east.

### passuk 25
<b>Who has separated a place for the hair</b> Heb. לטשף. In Arabia, a hair is called שִׁיטְפָא. To every hair on the head I have given תְעָלָה, a separate shaft from which to draw sap. If two would draw from the same shaft, a person’s eyesight would fail. These have not been changed by Me, how then should I change אִיוֹב, Job, for אוֹיֵב, enemy? And this is the meaning of מן הסערה, from the hair. Another explanation: לַשֶטֶף a streaming raindrop. I set apart for each drop a hole in the clouds, for if they were to come down [together] from one opening, they would soften the earth and turn it into a mire.
<b>and a way for the cloud of the thunderclaps</b> who parted? Every thunderclap has its own path, and if two of them would go along one path, the creatures would not be able to bear the sound.

### passuk 26

### passuk 27
<b>darkness</b> A land that is dark because of hunger.

### passuk 28
<b>waves of dew</b> Heb. אגלי, waves of גלי, dew, and the “aleph” is superfluous, as in (above 13: 17), “and to my speech (ואחותי) in your ears.” The “aleph” is superfluous at the beginning of the word because it is a noun, and similarly (Ezek. 21:20), “the scream of (אבחת) the sword,” like נבוח, barking, the scream of the sword. Another explanation: is like אַגְנֵי, basins of dew. A type of basins, divisions in which the dew is deposited. The “lammed” is interchangeable with a “nun,” and so in the Book of Ezra (Neh. 13:7), chamber (נִשְׁכָּה) like לִשְׁכָּה.

### passuk 29
<b>and the frost</b> glass or glassa in Old French.

<b>or loose the straps of Orion</b> to bring out its heat, to mitigate the cold of the Pleiades.

### passuk 32
<b>constellations</b> All the other constellations.
<b>and...Ayish</b> The largest star in the Pleiades, to which many stars are attached. He took two stars from it to open the windows of the Deluge, and they were placed in the constellation of Aries and the Holy One, blessed be He, is destined to restore them to her. Tanchuma.

### passuk 33
<b>his dominion</b> The dominion of the constellations appointed to bring upon the earth cold and heat, summer and winter.

### passuk 34
<b>Can you lift up your voice to the cloud</b> to command it to tie up with the darkness of water so that an abundance of water cover you? That is the darkening of clouds, like (above 22:11), “or darkness so that you do not see.” <b>[or] will an abundance of water</b> from Heaven cover you by your commands.

### passuk 35
<b>and say to you</b> in the place where they were sent, ‘Here we are; we have performed our errand,’ because they need not return to their place to reply to their Sender, for the Shechinah is everywhere.

<b>the rooster</b> Heb. לשכוי. This is the rooster in the language of the Sages (Rosh Hashanah 26a). And some say: This is the heart, which looks (שוכה), watches, and considers the coming events.

### passuk 37
<b>charges</b> Heb. יספר, will speak and charge with their mission.
<b>the bottles</b> Made like bottles in which the rains are collected, as in (I Sam. 1:24), “and an earthenware jug (ונבל) of wine.”

### passuk 38
<b>When the dust was poured</b> On the day that I poured the dust.
<b>into a mass</b> for the foundation of the world, into its midst.
<b>and the clods cleaved together</b> around it on all sides, until its length and width were filled.

### passuk 39

<b>to lie in wait</b> so is the habit of those who lie in wait, to crouch and to stoop themselves so that they will not be recognized.

### passuk 41
<b>they wander for lack of food</b> for their own fathers hate them, and the Holy One, blessed be He, prepares gnats for them, which are created from their dung, and they enter their mouths.
