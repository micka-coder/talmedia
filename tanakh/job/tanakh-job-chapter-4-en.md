Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said:

### passuk 2
If one venture a word unto thee, wilt thou be weary? But who can withhold himself from speaking?

### passuk 3
Behold, thou hast instructed many, And thou hast strengthened the weak hands.

### passuk 4
Thy words have upholden him that was falling, And thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.

### passuk 5
But now it is come upon thee, and thou art weary; It toucheth thee, and thou art affrighted.

### passuk 6
Is not thy fear of God thy confidence, And thy hope the integrity of thy ways?

### passuk 7
Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? Or where were the upright cut off?

### passuk 8
According as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, And sow mischief, reap the same.

### passuk 9
By the breath of God they perish, And by the blast of His anger are they consumed.

### passuk 10
The lion roareth, and the fierce lion howleth— Yet the teeth of the young lions are broken.

### passuk 11
The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, And the whelps of the lioness are scattered abroad.

### passuk 12
Now a word was secretly brought to me, And mine ear received a whisper thereof.

### passuk 13
In thoughts from the visions of the night, When deep sleep falleth on men,

### passuk 14
Fear came upon me, and trembling, And all my bones were made to shake. .

### passuk 15
Then a spirit passed before my face, That made the hair of my flesh to stand up.

### passuk 16
It stood still, but I could not discern the appearance thereof; A form was before mine eyes; I heard a still voice:

### passuk 17
’Shall mortal man be just before God? Shall a man be pure before his Maker?

### passuk 18
Behold, He putteth no trust in His servants, And His angels He chargeth with folly;

### passuk 19
How much more them that dwell in houses of clay, Whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed before the moth!

### passuk 20
Betwixt morning and evening they are shattered; They perish for ever without any regarding it.

### passuk 21
Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them? They die, and that without wisdom.’
