### passuk 1
Then Job answered and said:

### passuk 2
How hast thou helped him that is without power! How hast thou saved the arm that hath no strength!

### passuk 3
How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom, And plentifully declared sound knowledge!

### passuk 4
With whose help hast thou uttered words? And whose spirit came forth from thee?

### passuk 5
The shades tremble Beneath the waters and the inhabitants thereof.

### passuk 6
The nether-world is naked before Him, And Destruction hath no covering.

### passuk 7
He stretcheth out the north over the empty space, And hangeth the earth over nothing.

### passuk 8
He bindeth up the waters in His thick clouds; And the cloud is not rent under them.

### passuk 9
He closeth in the face of His throne, And spreadeth His cloud upon it.

### passuk 10
He hath described a boundary upon the face of the waters, Unto the confines of light and darkness.

### passuk 11
The pillars of heaven tremble And are astonished at His rebuke.

### passuk 12
He stirreth up the sea with His power, And by His understanding He smiteth through Rahab.

### passuk 13
By His breath the heavens are serene; His hand hath pierced the slant serpent.

### passuk 14
Lo, these are but the outskirts of His ways; And how small a whisper is heard of Him! But the thunder of His mighty deeds who can understand?
