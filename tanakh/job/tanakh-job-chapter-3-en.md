### passuk 1
After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.

### passuk 2
And Job spoke, and said:

### passuk 3
Let the day perish wherein I was born, And the night wherein it was said: ‘A man-child is brought forth.’

### passuk 4
Let that day be darkness; Let not God inquire after it from above, Neither let the light shine upon it.

### passuk 5
Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own; Let a cloud dwell upon it; Let all that maketh black the day terrify it.

### passuk 6
As for that night, let thick darkness seize upon it; Let it not rejoice among the days of the year; Let it not come into the number of the months.

### passuk 7
Lo, let that night be desolate; Let no joyful voice come therein.

### passuk 8
Let them curse it that curse the day, Who are ready to rouse up leviathan.

### passuk 9
Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; Let it look for light, but have none; Neither let it behold the eyelids of the morning;

### passuk 10
Because it shut not up the doors of my [mother’s] womb, Nor hid trouble from mine eyes.

### passuk 11
Why died I not from the womb? Why did I not perish at birth?

### passuk 12
Why did the knees receive me? And wherefore the breasts, that I should suck?

### passuk 13
For now should I have lain still and been quiet; I should have slept; then had I been at rest—

### passuk 14
With kings and counsellors of the earth, Who built up waste places for themselves;

### passuk 15
Or with princes that had gold, Who filled their houses with silver;

### passuk 16
Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been; As infants that never saw light.

### passuk 17
There the wicked cease from troubling; And there the weary are at rest.

### passuk 18
There the prisoners are at ease together; They hear not the voice of the taskmaster.

### passuk 19
The small and great are there alike; And the servant is free from his master.

### passuk 20
Wherewith is light given to him that is in misery, And life unto the bitter in soul—

### passuk 21
Who long for death, but it cometh not; And dig for it more than for hid treasures;

### passuk 22
Who rejoice unto exultation, And are glad, when they can find the grave?—

### passuk 23
To a man whose way is hid, And whom God hath hedged in?

### passuk 24
For my sighing cometh instead of my food, And my roarings are poured out like water.

### passuk 25
For the thing which I did fear is come upon me, And that which I was afraid of hath overtaken me.

### passuk 26
I was not at ease, neither was I quiet, Neither had I rest; but trouble came.
