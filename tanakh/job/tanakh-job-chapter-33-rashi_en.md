<b>and with their chastisement He seals [them]</b> He seals them and binds them with suffering because of their iniquity.

### passuk 17
<b>To restrain man</b> in his illness.
<b>a deed</b> that he had intended to do.
<b>and He covers haughtiness from man</b> with his suffering, in order to vanquish him and humble him to repent, so that he withhold his soul from utter death.
<b>haughtiness</b> Heb. וְגֵוָה, like גַאֲוָה.

### passuk 18

<b>by the sword</b> Heb. בשלח, a weapon, and so in Ezra (Neh. 4:11): “and one was holding the weapon (השלח).”

<b>He is gracious to him</b> i.e., the Omnipresent.
<b>Redeem him</b> Heb. פדעהו, like פְדָאֵהוּ. The “alef” is replaced by an “ayin.” The context proves it. “I found ransom,” which is redemption.

### passuk 25
<b>His flesh is agitated from shaking</b> Heb. רֻטֲפַש means escos in French, shaken.
<b>from shaking</b> His flesh was agitated from the shaking, that it was shaken [by the suffering of] his illness. This word [רֻטֲפַש] has no similarity in Scripture, and according to the context, we found it necessary to explain according to the meaning of the topic. But the one who interprets it as an expression of mire (רפש) and claims that the “teth” is added to it, as in (Gen. 44:16), “How can we clear ourselves (נצטדק)?” is in great error, because the “teth” is added to a word only in the reflexive voice, and to a word in which there is a radical “zaddi,” but nor in other words. for example, צדק and נצטדק, and like (Lev. 13:44) צרוּע, stricken with “zaraath,” and נצטרע, was stricken with “zaraath.” (Prov. 25: 13), “an emissary (ציר) faithful,” and (Josh. 9:4), “and they went and disguised as ambassadors (ויצטירו)”; (Gen. 45:21) “צֵדָה, provision,” and (Josh. 9:12) “הִצְטַיַדְנוּ, we took... for our provision.”
<b>he will be restored</b> with his strength and with healing to the days of his youth.

### passuk 26

### passuk 27
<b>He makes a row of men</b> He makes a row of men when he is saved from his illness and confesses [before them] to his Creator.
<b>but I did not profit</b> I had no profit in its matters.

### passuk 28

### passuk 29
<b>twice or thrice</b> He chastises him for his iniquities with his illness in order not to destroy him, but if he provokes Him further, he should be concerned with Gehinnom or death, as it is written, “Yea for four, I will not return them” (Amos 1:3).
