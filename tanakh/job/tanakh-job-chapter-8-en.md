Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said:

### passuk 2
How long wilt thou speak these things, Seeing that the words of thy mouth are as a mighty wind?

### passuk 3
Doth God pervert judgment? Or doth the Almighty pervert justice?

### passuk 4
If thy children sinned against Him, He delivered them into the hand of their transgression.

### passuk 5
If thou wouldest seek earnestly unto God, And make thy supplication to the Almighty;

### passuk 6
If thou wert pure and upright; Surely now He would awake for thee, And make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.

### passuk 7
And though thy beginning was small, Yet thy end should greatly increase.

### passuk 8
For inquire, I pray thee, of the former generation, And apply thyself to that which their fathers have searched out—

### passuk 9
For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, Because our days upon earth are a shadow—

### passuk 10
Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, And utter words out of their heart?

### passuk 11
Can the rush shoot up without mire? Can the reed-grass grow without water?

### passuk 12

### passuk 13
So are the paths of all that forget God; And the hope of the godless man shall perish;

### passuk 14
Whose confidence is gossamer, And whose trust is a spider’s web.

### passuk 15

### passuk 16
He is green before the sun, And his shoots go forth over his garden.

### passuk 17
His roots are wrapped about the heap, He beholdeth the place of stones.

### passuk 18
If he be destroyed from his place, Then it shall deny him: ‘I have not seen thee.’

### passuk 19
Behold, this is the joy of his way, And out of the earth shall others spring.

### passuk 20
Behold, God will not cast away an innocent man, Neither will He uphold the evil-doers;

### passuk 21
Till He fill thy mouth with laughter, And thy lips with shouting.

### passuk 22
They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; And the tent of the wicked shall be no more.
