### passuk 1
Call now; is there any that will answer thee? And to which of the holy ones wilt thou turn?

### passuk 2
For anger killeth the foolish man, And envy slayeth the silly one.

### passuk 3
I have seen the foolish taking root; But suddenly I beheld his habitation cursed.

### passuk 4
His children are far from safety, And are crushed in the gate, with none to deliver them.

### passuk 5
Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, And taketh it even out of the thorns, and the snare gapeth for their substance.

### passuk 6
For affliction cometh not forth from the dust, Neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;

### passuk 7
But man is born unto trouble, As the sparks fly upward.

### passuk 8
But as for me, I would seek unto God, And unto God would I commit my cause;

### passuk 9
Who doeth great things and unsearchable, Marvellous things without number;

### passuk 10
Who giveth rain upon the earth, And sendeth waters upon the fields;

### passuk 11
So that He setteth up on high those that are low, And those that mourn are exalted to safety.

### passuk 12
He frustrateth the devices of the crafty, So that their hands can perform nothing substantial.

### passuk 13
He taketh the wise in their own craftiness; And the counsel of the wily is carried headlong.

### passuk 14
They meet with darkness in the day-time, And grope at noonday as in the night. .

### passuk 15
But He saveth from the sword of their mouth, Even the needy from the hand of the mighty.

### passuk 16
So the poor hath hope, And iniquity stoppeth her mouth.

### passuk 17
Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth; Therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty.

### passuk 18
For He maketh sore, and bindeth up; He woundeth, and His hands make whole.

### passuk 19
He will deliver thee in six troubles; Yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.

### passuk 20
In famine He will redeem thee from death; And in war from the power of the sword.

### passuk 21
Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue; Neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.

### passuk 22
At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh; Neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.

### passuk 23
For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field; And the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.

### passuk 24
And thou shalt know that thy tent is in peace; And thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt miss nothing.

### passuk 25
Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, And thine offspring as the grass of the earth.

### passuk 26
Thou shalt come to thy grave in a ripe age, Like as a shock of corn cometh in in its season.

### passuk 27
Lo this, we have searched it, So it is; hear it, and know thou it for thy good.
