### passuk 1
My spirit consumed, my days are extinct, The grave is ready for me.

### passuk 2
Surely there are mockers with me, And mine eye abideth in their provocation.

### passuk 3
Give now a pledge, be surety for me with Thyself; Who else is there that will strike hands with me?

### passuk 4
For Thou hast hid their heart from understanding; Therefore shalt Thou not exalt them.

### passuk 5
He that denounceth his friends for the sake of flattery, Even the eyes of his children shall fail.

### passuk 6
He hath made me also a byword of the people; And I am become one in whose face they spit.

### passuk 7
Mine eye also is dimmed by reason of vexation, And all my members are as a shadow.

### passuk 8
Upright men are astonished at this, And the innocent stirreth up himself against the godless.

### passuk 9
Yet the righteous holdeth on his way, And he that hath clean hands waxeth stronger and stronger.

### passuk 10
But as for you all, do ye return, and come now; And I shall not find a wise man among you.

### passuk 11
My days are past, my purposes are broken off, Even the thoughts of my heart.

### passuk 12
They change the night into day; The light is short because of darkness.

### passuk 13
If I look for the nether-world as my house; If I have spread my couch in the darkness;

### passuk 14
If I have said to corruption: ‘Thou art my father’, To the worm: ‘Thou art my mother, and my sister’;

### passuk 15
Where then is my hope? And as for my hope, who shall see it?

### passuk 16
They shall go down to the bars of the nether-world, When we are at rest together in the dust.
