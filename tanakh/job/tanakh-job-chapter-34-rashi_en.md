<b>Who gave Him a charge over the earth</b> Who rules over Him, saying, ‘Why did You do so?’ or ‘I did not command You so’? For who gave Him a charge over His dominion, and why should He find pretexts for His creatures? He need not answer one who rules over Him by saying ‘Because of this I harmed him.’

### passuk 17
<b>Will...even one who hates judgment</b> Will the Omnipresent heal [even the one who hates the judgment] of the just Judge? If you say that [to do so] is not judgment, for He acted not in accordance with the law, is it possible that you should condemn One Who is very righteous?

### passuk 21

### passuk 23
<b>For He will not place additional [guilt] on a man</b> That is to say: You said (23:6), ‘He will not place upon me anything but my sins,’ only my sins alone, and I reply to you that the Holy One, blessed be He, will not place on His creatures additional accusations over their transgression. [The word] עוד is an expression of addition.
<b>to go to God in judgment</b> When He comes upon His creatures to debate with them.

### passuk 24
<b>He shatters</b> Heb. ירע, [like] ירוֹצֵץ. He shatters, and like (Isa. 24:19), “has broken (התרעעה).”

### passuk 28

### passuk 29
<b>When He quiets</b> He gives the poor [some peace and] quiet from those who oppress [them]. Now who will deal wickedly anymore? And as long as He hid His face, who will see Him?
<b>whether [it be done] to a nation or to a man, alike</b> As for individuals, [or] as for a multitude it is the same to Him to quiet [them] and to hide His face.

### passuk 30
<b>And it shall be quiet, that a flattering man shall not reign because of the snares of the people</b> Over the poor, who reigned.
<b>because of the snares of the people</b> [who were guilty] of iniquity, and concerning such a God, you should not have said, ‘scoundrel,’ and ‘wicked.

### passuk 31
<b>For to God should be said</b> To be said to Him. It is fitting and proper for all those who suffer pains to say, ‘I bear, accept, and tolerate Your judgments, and I will not destroy myself.’ Further, the one who is judged must say...

### passuk 32
<b>Besides what I see</b> Besides what I know to perceive in Your words, You instruct me, and if I have committed injustice, I will not continue.

### passuk 33
<b>From you should He pay it, for you despised etc.</b> so did Elihu say to Job, “Should the Holy One, blessed be He, have taken counsel from you about repaying you?”
<b>for you despised</b> saying (above 7: 16), “I despised [my life]; I will not live forever”; (above 6:9) “enlarge His hand and finish me off.” Do you think that He would collect from you according to your thoughts and your desire, and you would choose the payment—not I? Elihu spoke instead of the Holy One, blessed be He, with a question.

### passuk 34
<b>Men of understanding will say to me</b> that Job does not speak with knowledge.

### passuk 35

### passuk 36
<b>My Father! May [Job] be tried</b> You are my Father. The Holy One, blessed be He, is the Father of all. If only Job were tried to eternity, in order that there be repentance among men of iniquity. And also to men Scripture speaks in this manner (II Kings 5:13): “‘Master (אבי), if the prophet spoke to you to do a difficult thing etc.’” Another explanation: אבי is like (Ecc. 12:5), “and the sexual desire (האביונה) will fail,” an expression of desire. Menachem (Machbereth p. 11) associated it in this manner, and this is its interpretation: אָבִי יִבָּחֵן אִיוֹב עַד נֶצַח, my wish and my desire are that Job should be tried to eternity (omitted in some editions).

### passuk 37
<b>he speaks loquaciously</b> Heb. יספוק is an expression of many words and raising the voice.
<b>among us he speaks loquaciously</b> He asks, Why should we be concerned with his words? (above 19:4), ‘And even if I have indeed erred, let my error stay with me,’ and he does not know that we are punished, and he increases iniquities for us because we are listening. So it is explained in Leviticus Rabbah (4:6).
