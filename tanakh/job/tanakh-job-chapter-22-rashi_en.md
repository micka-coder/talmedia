### passuk 2
<b>Eliphaz’s reply</b><br><b>Does a man benefit God</b> Will a man avail and benefit for the need and the benefit of the Creator when he teaches the people knowledge and wisdom? The first יִסְכָּן is an expression of benefit [or pleasure], like (I Kings 1:2), “and she shall be to him a warmer (סֹכֶנֶת).” The second is an expression of teaching [or accustoming], like (Num. 22:30), “Have I ever been in the habit (ההסכן הסכנתי)?” The former may also be interpreted as an expression of teaching, thus: Does a man learn for the good of the Creator and for His need when he learns wisdom?

### passuk 3
<b>Does the Almighty care</b> Like (above 21:21), “For what does He care (חפצו) about his house after him?” What pleasure or concern does He have if you are righteous in your deeds, that you reason with Him that He come with you to contest your words?
<b>or...any gain</b> i.e., monetary gain for Him if you perfect your ways?

### passuk 4
<b>Will He reason with you because He fears you?</b> Or, out of fear, that He fears you, will He come and reason with you?

### passuk 5
<b>Is not</b> [Is it not so] that He knows that your evil is great?

### passuk 6

### passuk 7

### passuk 8
<b>Does a strong man own the earth</b> This is a question. Because you were strong, should you inherit the earth?
<b>remain therein</b> Is he fit to remain in existence?

### passuk 9

### passuk 11
<b>or darkness so that you do not see</b> That is to say, You shall not put your eyes and your trust in strength, and say...

### passuk 12
<b>Is not God in the height of heaven</b> and will not lower Himself to see.
<b>and behold the topmost of the stars, which are lofty</b> Heb. וראה, like (above 10:15), “and seeing (וראה) my affliction” at the end of the fifth reply. That is to say, ‘And You gaze upon the topmost stars because they are lofty.’ Therefore, you said...

### passuk 13
<b>‘What does God know?’</b> of what occurs in the dark?
<b>Does He judge through the dark cloud?</b> Does He see and judge facing this darkness? Behold...

### passuk 14
<b>Thick clouds are a concealment</b> before Him, and He cannot see.
<b>and He walks on the circle of the heavens</b> and does not know what is on the earth.
<b>circle</b> Heb. חוג, the circle of the compass of the heavens, like (Isa. 44:13), “and with a compass (ובמחוגה) he rounds it,” compas in French

### passuk 15

### passuk 16

### passuk 17

### passuk 18

### passuk 19

### passuk 20
<b>Whether their substance was cut off</b> Will you watch and see whether their substance was cut off.
<b>their substance</b> Heb קימנו, like קומתו, his substance; i.e., of that generation, like (Hosea 12:5), “in Bethel he shall fed Him, and there He shall speak with him (עמנו),” like עִמוֹ.
<b>consumed by the fire</b> They were judged with boiling water. Rabbi Tanchuma expounded that they were tall and did not die in the depths. Then boiling water fell upon them from above and this is the meaning of יִתְרָם, their unusually tall height. So I heard.

### passuk 21
<b>Accustom yourself</b> Accustom yourself to be (wholehearted) with him.
<b>and you will be complete</b> And you will be complete, lacking nothing.
<b>with them</b> With these things.

### passuk 22

### passuk 23

### passuk 24
<b>Then you shall make a fortification on the earth</b> By returning to Him, you will establish on the earth strength and fortifications.
<b>and on the rocks of the valleys</b> On the lofty rocks in the deep valleys, you shall have a collection of an accumulation of Ophir. This is the treasure of the kings, for they would gather and store gold that came from Ophir.

### passuk 25
<b>And the Almighty shall be of your adversaries</b> Heb. והיה שד-י בצריך. If this word is holy [i.e., is a reference to the Almighty], I am bewildered at its interpretation, because its meaning is a curse, that He will be counted with his enemies, as in (Jud. 11:35), “and you have become one of those who trouble me (בעכרי),” with those who trouble me. By necessity, we will adjudge it as one of the elliptical verses, [meaning: And the Almighty shall be the Judge over your adversaries. But if we can interpret it as profane, as an expression of a judge and of strength, the following is its interpretation:] And your fortifications (בצריך) shall be strong (שד-י), like “Then you shall make a fortification (בצר) on the earth.” That is, powerful wealth will be fortified, and according to the context, that is indeed its interpretation, as evidenced by the end of the verse, “and you shall have abundant (תועפות) silver,” an expression of strength, like (Num. 23:22), “his is like the power of (כתועפות) a wild ox.”

### passuk 26
<b>and lift your countenance to God</b> You will not come to lift your face except to ask Him for your needs.

### passuk 27
<b>and you will pay your wows</b> You will be confident that your sacrifices, the payments of your vows, will be accepted.

### passuk 28
<b>and it will be accomplished for you</b> Heb. ויקם, lit. and it will rise, like וְיָקוּם לָךְ.

### passuk 29
<b>If they are humble</b> If you see your generation humble, pledge that it be uplifted, and it will be uplifted.
<b>a humble person</b> [One who is humbled] by the trouble that befalls [him] because of his iniquity, 
God <b>will save</b> through your hands and through your prayer.

### passuk 30
<b>He shall deliver one who is not innocent</b> Heb. אי נקי, synonymous with אין נקִי, not innocent, like (I Sam. 4:21), “Ichabod (איכבוד),” meaning, there is no glory (אין כבוד). And so (Prov. 31:4), “neither is drunkenness for rulers (אי שכר),” there is no drunkenness (אין שכר). It does not befit them to become intoxicated. Menachem joined the three into one group (Machbereth Menachem p. 22). Although they are two words (?), they explain them thus. And that one who is not innocent will be delivered because of the purity of your hands. So I heard. I heard another version that was being said in the name of Rabbi Jacob: This is an expression of a man who lives in pain and sighing, and the “yud” is superfluous in the word, like (Ps. 123:1), “Who dwells (הישבי) in heaven.” But I did not hear this from the rabbi’s mouth.
