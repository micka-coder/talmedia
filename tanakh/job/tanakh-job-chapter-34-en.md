### passuk 1
Moreover Elihu answered and said:

### passuk 2
Hear my words, ye wise men; And give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.

### passuk 3
For the ear trieth words, As the palate tasteth food.

### passuk 4
Let us choose for us that which is right; Let us know among ourselves what is good.

### passuk 5
For Job hath said: ‘I am righteous, And God hath taken away my right;

### passuk 6
Notwithstanding my right I am accounted a liar; My wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.’

### passuk 7
What man is like Job, Who drinketh up scorning like water?

### passuk 8
Who goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, And walketh with wicked men.

### passuk 9
For he hath said: ‘It profiteth a man nothing That he should be in accord with God.’

### passuk 10
Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: Far be it from God, that He should do wickedness; And from the Almighty, that He should commit iniquity.

### passuk 11
For the work of a man will He requite unto him, And cause every man to find according to his ways.

### passuk 12
Yea, of a surety, God will not do wickedly, Neither will the Almighty pervert justice.

### passuk 13
Who gave Him a charge over the earth? Or who hath disposed the whole world?

### passuk 14
If He set His heart upon man, If He gather unto Himself his spirit and his breath;

### passuk 15
All flesh shall perish together, And man shall return unto dust.

### passuk 16
If now thou hast understanding, hear this; Hearken to the voice of my words.

### passuk 17
Shall even one that hateth right govern? And wilt thou condemn Him that is just and mighty—

### passuk 18
Is it fit to say to a king: ‘Thou art base’? Or to nobles: ‘Ye are wicked’?—

### passuk 19
That respecteth not the persons of princes, Nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? For they all are the work of His hands.

### passuk 20
In a moment they die, even at midnight; The people are shaken and pass away, And the mighty are taken away without hand. .

### passuk 21
For His eyes are upon the ways of a man, And He seeth all his goings.

### passuk 22
There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.

### passuk 23
For He doth not appoint a time unto any man, When he should go before God in judgment.

### passuk 24
He breaketh in pieces mighty men without inquisition, And setteth others in their stead.

### passuk 25
Therefore He taketh knowledge of their works; And He overturneth them in the night, so that they are crushed.

### passuk 26
He striketh them as wicked men In the open sight of others;

### passuk 27
Because they turned aside from following Him, And would not have regard to any of His ways;

### passuk 28
So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto Him, And He heareth the cry of the afflicted.

### passuk 29
When He giveth quietness, who then can condemn? And when He hideth His face, who then can behold Him? Whether it be done unto a nation, or unto a man, alike;

### passuk 30
That the godless man reign not, That there be none to ensnare the people.

### passuk 31
For hath any said unto God: ‘I have borne chastisement, though I offend not;

### passuk 32
That which I see not teach Thou me; If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more’?

### passuk 33
Shall His recompense be as thou wilt? For thou loathest it, So that thou must choose, and not I; Therefore speak what thou knowest.

### passuk 34
Men of understanding will say unto me, Yea, every wise man that heareth me:

### passuk 35
’Job speaketh without knowledge, And his words are without discernment.’

### passuk 36
Would that Job were tried unto the end, Because of his answering like wicked men.

### passuk 37
For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, He clappeth his hands among us, And multiplieth his words against God.
