Why are times not laid up by the Almighty? And why do not they that know Him see His days?

### passuk 2
There are that remove the landmarks; They violently take away flocks, and feed them.

### passuk 3
They drive away the ass of the fatherless, They take the widow’s ox for a pledge.

### passuk 4
They turn the needy out of the way; The poor of the earth hide themselves together.

### passuk 5
Behold, as wild asses in the wilderness They go forth to their work, seeking diligently for food; The desert yieldeth them bread for their children.

### passuk 6
They cut his provender in the field; And they despoil the vineyard of the wicked.

### passuk 7
They lie all night naked without clothing, And have no covering in the cold.

### passuk 8
They are wet with the showers of the mountains, And embrace the rock for want of a shelter.

### passuk 9
There are that pluck the fatherless from the breast, And take a pledge of the poor;

### passuk 10
So that they go about naked without clothing, And being hungry they carry the sheaves;

### passuk 11
They make oil within the rows of these men; They tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst.

### passuk 12
From out of the populous city men groan, And the soul of the wounded crieth out; Yet God imputeth it not for unseemliness.

### passuk 13
These are of them that rebel against the light; They know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.

### passuk 14
The murderer riseth with the light, to kill the poor and needy; And in the night he is as a thief.

### passuk 15
The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, Saying: ‘No eye shall see me’; And he putteth a covering on his face. .

### passuk 16
In the dark they dig through houses; They shut themselves up in the day-time; They know not the light.

### passuk 17
For the shadow of death is to all of them as the morning; For they know the terrors of the shadow of death.

### passuk 18
He is swift upon the face of the waters; Their portion is cursed in the earth; He turneth not by the way of the vineyards.

### passuk 19
Drought and heat consume the snow waters; So doth the nether-world those that have sinned.

### passuk 20
The womb forgetteth him; the worm feedeth sweetly on him; He shall be no more remembered; And unrighteousness is broken as a tree.

### passuk 21
He devoureth the barren that beareth not; And doeth not good to the widow.

### passuk 22
He draweth away the mighty also by his power; He riseth up, and he trusteth not his own life.

### passuk 23
Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth, Yet His eyes are upon their ways.

### passuk 24
They are exalted for a little while, and they are gone; Yea, they are brought low, they are gathered in as all others, And wither as the tops of the ears of corn.

### passuk 25
And if it be not so now, who will prove me a liar, And make my speech nothing worth?
