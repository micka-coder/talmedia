<b>than God</b> More than the Omnipresent.

### passuk 3
<b>and condemned Job</b> This is one of the verses wherein the Scribes rectified the language of the Scripture. “And they condemned,” as directed against the Omnipresent, by remaining silent, should have been written, but Scripture euphemized. Similarly (Num. 11:15), “and do not let me see my misfortune.” It should have been written: “and do not let me see their misfortune,” but Scripture euphemized, and so many [other] instances, in Sifrei (ad loc.) and in the Great Masorah.

<b>Yea, I attended to you</b> I attended to you, and I saw that there is no one to convince Job.

### passuk 13
<b>Lest you say</b> You shall not say <b>We have found wisdom</b> by remaining silent in order not to provoke him anymore. <b>for God will crush him and not a man</b> You should not have belittled the honor of the Omnipresent thereby.

### passuk 14

### passuk 20

### passuk 21
<b>neither will I euphemize</b> I will not change my words to replace them [with milder expressions] in deference to his [Job’s] honor, as I said above, “And they condemned Job.” This is a euphemism, which changes the expression because of His honor. I will not even do this, but I will reprove him explicitly.

### passuk 22
<b>or else...would carry me away</b> He would take me away from the world. Others interpret יִשָׂאֵנִי like (Nahum 1:5), “and the land raised up (ותשא) from before me [a pillar of smoke].”
