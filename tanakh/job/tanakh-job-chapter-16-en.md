### passuk 1
Then Job answered and said:

### passuk 2
I have heard many such things; Sorry comforters are ye all.

### passuk 3
Shall windy words have an end? Or what provoketh thee that thou answerest?

### passuk 4
I also could speak as ye do; If your soul were in my soulâ€™s stead, I could join words together against you, And shake my head at you.

### passuk 5
I would strengthen you with my mouth, And the moving of my lips would assuage your grief.

### passuk 6
Though I speak, my pain is not assuaged; And though I forbear, what am I eased?

### passuk 7
But now He hath made me weary; Thou hast made desolate all my company.

### passuk 8
And Thou hast shrivelled me up, which is a witness against me; And my leanness riseth up against me, it testifieth to my face.

### passuk 9
He hath torn me in His wrath, and hated me; He hath gnashed upon me with His teeth; Mine adversary sharpeneth his eyes upon me.

### passuk 10
They have gaped upon me with their mouth; They have smitten me upon the cheek scornfully; They gather themselves together against me.

### passuk 11
God delivereth me to the ungodly, And casteth me into the hands of the wicked.

### passuk 12
I was at ease, and He broke me asunder; Yea, He hath taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces; He hath also set me up for His mark.

### passuk 13
His archers compass me round about, He cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; He poureth out my gall upon the ground.

### passuk 14
He breaketh me with breach upon breach; He runneth upon me like a giant.

### passuk 15
I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, And have laid my horn in the dust.

### passuk 16
My face is reddened with weeping, And on my eyelids is the shadow of death;

### passuk 17
Although there is no violence in my hands, And my prayer is pure.

### passuk 18
O earth, cover not thou my blood, And let my cry have no resting-place.

### passuk 19
Even now, behold, my Witness is in heaven, And He that testifieth of me is on high.

### passuk 20
Mine inward thoughts are my intercessors, Mine eye poureth out tears unto God;

### passuk 21
That He would set aright a man contending with God, As a son of man setteth aright his neighbour! .

### passuk 22
For the years that are few are coming on, And I shall go the way whence I shall not return.
