<b>Job’s Reply</b><br><b>I knew that You can do everything</b> That You can do anything that pleases You.
<b>and no design is restrained from You</b> He repeats his words, that no design or plan is restrained or withheld from You, that You can complete and fulfill Your plans, for strength and might are in Your hand, and You have the power to do all that pleases You. This verse is similar to (Gen. 11:6), “Now will nothing that they have planned to do be restrained (יבצר) from them?”

### passuk 3
<b>Who is this</b> who concealed and covered the counsel and the wonders of the Holy One, blessed be He, without knowledge? I knew that everything is in Your hand to do, and so I related some of Your mighty deeds as were in my heart; as I knew [them].
<b>but I did not understand</b> But I did not understand so much, as You informed me, for many wonders are hidden and concealed from me, which I do not know.

### passuk 4

### passuk 5
<b>I have heard of You by the hearing of the ear</b> Many many times I have heard of You. <b>and now, my eye has seen You</b> Your Shechinah.

<b>and your two companions</b> Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite.
<b>because you did not speak</b> Because you did not speak to Me with a correct argument as did My servant Job, for he did not rebel against Me except for what he said (above 9:22), “He destroys both the innocent and the wicked,” and through the Adversary who denounces the world, as it is stated (ibid. verse 23): “If the scourge kills suddenly etc.” And if he continued to speak, he spoke because of the severity of the pains that burdened him and overwhelmed him; but you rebelled by condemning him, saying (4: 6), “Behold, your fear was your foolishness,” and you held him to be a wicked man, and at the end when you were silenced and defeated before him, you should have consoled him as Elihu did. Was it not enough for Job with his trouble and his sufferings, that you added rebellion to your sins to provoke him?

### passuk 8
<b>and offer up a burnt offering for yourselves</b> So that you placate and appease Me, provided that My servant Job pray for you that I forgive your sins, and no longer remember your transgressions.
<b>for I will favor him</b> Heb. כי אם, because I will favor him to accept his prayer (thus the word אִם is used for “that”), and likewise (Gen. 24:19), “until (עד אם) they have finished drinking”; (Ex. 21:30), “in which case (אם) an atonement is placed on him,” and many others.
<b>for...not</b> Because...not.

### passuk 9
<b>and the Lord favored Job</b> Heb. וישא, [lit. and the Lord lifted His countenance] as in (Gen. 19: 21), “I have favored you (נשאתי) also in this respect,” that He accepted his prayer and showed him a bright countenance.

### passuk 10
<b>Now the Lord returned Job’s captivity when he prayed</b> [The word] שָׁב is inappropriate in this matter, and it is as though it were written: “And He returned (נשאתי) Job’s captivity when he prayed.”
<b>for his friend</b> In the merit that he prayed for each friend of his.
<b>twice as much</b> Heb. למשנה, for one, two; and Scripture was not exact in its wording.

<b>and each one</b> and every one of them.

### passuk 15
<b>Nowhere...were women as beautiful as Job’s daughters to be found</b> An instance of beautiful women like the phenomenon of the beauty of Job’s daughters was not found. This verse is on the pattern of (Num. 9:6), “But there was [an incident of] men who were unclean.”
