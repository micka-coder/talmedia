### passuk 1
Then Job answered and said:

### passuk 2
Oh that my vexation were but weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances altogether!

### passuk 3
For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas; therefore are my words broken.

### passuk 4
For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof my spirit drinketh up; the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.

### passuk 5
Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? Or loweth the ox over his fodder?

### passuk 6
Can that which hath no savour be eaten without salt? Or is there any taste in the juice of mallows?

### passuk 7
My soul refuseth to touch them; they are as the sickness of my flesh.

### passuk 8
Oh that I might have my request, and that God would grant me the thing that I long for! .

### passuk 9
Even that it would please God to crush me; that He would let loose His hand, and cut me off!

### passuk 10
Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would exult in pain, though He spare not; For I have not denied the words of the Holy One.

### passuk 11
What is my strength, that I should wait? And what is mine end, that I should be patient?

### passuk 12
Is my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh of brass?

### passuk 13
Is it that I have no help in me, and that sound wisdom is driven quite from me?

### passuk 14
To him that is ready to faint kindness is due from his friend, Even to him that forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.

### passuk 15
My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, As the channel of brooks that overflow,

### passuk 16
Which are black by reason of the ice, And wherein the snow hideth itself;

### passuk 17
What time they wax warm, they vanish, When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.

### passuk 18
The paths of their way do wind, They go up into the waste, and are lost.

### passuk 19
The caravans of Tema looked, The companies of Sheba waited for them—

### passuk 20
They were ashamed because they had hoped; They came thither, and were confounded.

### passuk 21
For now ye are become His; Ye see a terror, and are afraid.

### passuk 22
Did I say: ‘Give unto me’? Or: ‘Offer a present for me of your substance’?

### passuk 23
or: ‘Deliver me from the adversary’s hand’? Or: ‘Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors’?

### passuk 24
Teach me, and I will hold my peace; And cause me to understand wherein I have erred.

### passuk 25
How forcible are words of uprightness! But what doth your arguing argue?

### passuk 26
Do ye hold words to be an argument, But the speeches of one that is desperate to be wind?

### passuk 27
Yea, ye would cast lots upon the fatherless, And dig a pit for your friend.

### passuk 28
Now therefore be pleased to look upon me; For surely I shall not lie to your face.

### passuk 29
Return, I pray you, let there be no injustice; Yea, return again, my cause is righteous.

### passuk 30
Is there injustice on my tongue? Cannot my taste discern crafty devices?
