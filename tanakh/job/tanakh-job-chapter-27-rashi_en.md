### passuk 1
<b>Then Job again</b> His friends refrained from answering as Elihu reprimanded them, for they stood and replied no more (32:3).

### passuk 2
<b>As God lives</b> I swear that indeed He took away my right. From here Rabbi Joshua derived that Job served the Omnipresent out of love. No one swears by the king’s life unless he loves the king.

### passuk 5
<b>that I should justify you</b> That I should say that you are right in condemning me.
<b>I will not give up my innocence</b> I will not concede to your words and say that I am not innocent.

### passuk 6
<b>I have maintained my righteousness</b> To say that I am righteous.
<b>my heart will not reproach</b> me because of my days, i.e., because of any manner or trait with which I deported myself in my days. Therefore, perforce, my enemy shall be like a wicked man.

### passuk 7

### passuk 8
<b>For what is the hope of a flatterer</b> For why should I be a wicked man and a robber? What is the end of a wicked man who takes money by force?
<b>when God casts off</b> Heb. ישל. When the Omnipresent casts his soul off him. This is an expression of (Exod. 3:5), “Remove (של) your shoes”; (Deut. 19:5), “and the iron [head] slips off (ונשל).”

### passuk 9

### passuk 10
<b>Or will he delight with the Almighty</b> The double interrogative is like all double interrogatives. the first one is customarily prefixed by a “hey” and the second one by אִם ; e.g., (Amos 6:12), “Will horses run (הירצון) on the rock, or (אִם) will one plow with cattle?” (Job 6:30), “Is there (היש) injustice in my tongue, or (אִם) will my palate not understand wickedness?” Here, too, will God hearken to his cry...or will he delight with the Almighty? Will one who is a wicked man or a flatterer perhaps be able to delight and rely on the salvations of the Holy One, blessed be He, and call to Him in time of trouble? This is a question.

### passuk 11
<b>I will instruct you</b> what the standard is that is in God’s hand, and the way... <b>what is with the Almighty I will not conceal</b> Like (above 23:10), “Because He knows the way that is with me.”

### passuk 12
<b>all of you have seen</b> that this is the portion of a wicked man.
<b>now why do you become altogether vain?</b> To be wicked and hypocritical.

### passuk 13

### passuk 15

### passuk 16

### passuk 17
<b>and He will distribute [his] money to the innocent</b> The Holy One, blessed be He, will distribute the wicked man’s money to an innocent one.

### passuk 18
<b>He builds...as a moth</b> As a moth, who builds his hole which does not endure, and like a booth that the watchman of the fig tree and the vineyard makes, which is not permanent. (Another explanation: that the watchman of the vineyard, who does not watch it at all times, made. I heard this. Absent in certain editions.)

### passuk 19
<b>He dies rich</b> He will die with his riches, but sometimes he will not be gathered in to burial.

### passuk 20
<b>Terrors</b> Demons.
<b>a tempest snatches him away</b> and casts him away in disgrace.

### passuk 21

### passuk 22
<b>And he will cast upon him</b> i.e., the one who casts evil upon him will show no compassion.
<b>from his hand</b> of the wicked man, and from his strength. from his place.
<b>he will flee</b> His counselor, who assisted him from the start, will flee from assisting him at the time of his downfall, as Charbonah did to Haman (Esther 7:9).

### passuk 23
<b>They clap their hands over them</b> Those who knew [him] long ago and now see his ruin.
