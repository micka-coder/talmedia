### passuk 1
Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said:

### passuk 2
Should not the multitude of words be answered? And should a man full of talk be accounted right?

### passuk 3
Thy boastings have made men hold their peace, And thou hast mocked, with none to make thee ashamed;

### passuk 4
And thou hast said: ‘My doctrine is pure, And I am clean in Thine eyes.’

### passuk 5
But oh that God would speak, And open His lips against thee;

### passuk 6
And that He would tell thee the secrets of wisdom, That sound wisdom is manifold! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.

### passuk 7
Canst thou find out the deep things of God? Canst thou attain unto the purpose of the Almighty?

### passuk 8
It is high as heaven; what canst thou do? Deeper than the nether-world; what canst thou know?

### passuk 9
The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.

### passuk 10
If He pass by, and shut up, Or gather in, then who can hinder Him?

### passuk 11
For He knoweth base men; and when He seeth iniquity, will He not then consider it?

### passuk 12
But an empty man will get understanding, when a wild ass’s colt is born a man.

### passuk 13
If thou set thy heart aright, and stretch out thy hands toward Him—

### passuk 14
If iniquity be in thy hand, put it far away, and let not unrighteousness dwell in thy tents—

### passuk 15
Surely then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; Yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear;

### passuk 16
For thou shalt forget thy misery; Thou shalt remember it as waters that are passed away;

### passuk 17
And thy life shall be clearer than the noonday; though there be darkness, it shall be as the morning.

### passuk 18
And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt look about thee, and shalt take thy rest in safety.

### passuk 19
Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; Yea, many shall make suit unto thee.

### passuk 20
But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, And they shall have no way to flee, And their hope shall be the drooping of the soul.
