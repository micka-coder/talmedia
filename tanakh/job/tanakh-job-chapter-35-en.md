### passuk 1
Moreover Elihu answered and said:

### passuk 2
Thinkest thou this to be thy right, Or sayest thou: ‘I am righteousness before God’,

### passuk 3
That thou inquirest: ‘What advantage will it be unto Thee?’ And: ‘What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned?’

### passuk 4
I will give thee answer, And thy companions with thee.

### passuk 5
Look unto the heavens, and see; And behold the skies, which are higher than thou.

### passuk 6
If thou hast sinned, what doest thou against Him? And if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto Him?

### passuk 7
If thou be righteous, what givest thou Him? Or what receiveth He of thy hand?

### passuk 8
Thy wickedness concerneth a man as thou art; And thy righteousness a son of man.

### passuk 9
By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out; They cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty.

### passuk 10
But none saith: ‘Where is God my Maker, Who giveth songs in the night;

### passuk 11
Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, And maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?’

### passuk 12
There they cry, but none giveth answer, Because of the pride of evil men.

### passuk 13
Surely God will not hear vanity, Neither will the Almighty regard it.

### passuk 14
Yea, when thou sayest thou canst not see Him— The cause is before Him; therefore wait thou for Him.

### passuk 15
And now, is it for nought that He punished in His anger? And hath He not full knowledge of arrogance?

### passuk 16
But Job doth open his mouth in vanity; He multiplieth words without knowledge.
