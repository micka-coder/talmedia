### passuk 2
<b>Eliphaz’s Answer</b><br><b>Shall a wise man raise his voice with opinions of wind</b> It is puzzling. Should one who is wise answer and raise his voice with an opinion of wind and futility?

### passuk 3
<b>To debate over a matter from which he derives no benefit</b> Heb. יסכון. To debate over a matter from which he will derive no benefit, like (I Kings 1:2), “and she shall be to him a warmer (סכנת),” and like (Ecc. 10:9), “is warmed (יסכן) by it,” i.e., he will derive benefit from it.

### passuk 4
<b>Surely you</b> Surely you, who are very wise, will do away with fear by the multitude of your words.
<b>and increase speech</b> Heb. ותגרע, like (below 36:27) “He will increase (יגרע) the drops of water,” and like (ibid. 15:8), “and [did] you increase (ותגרע) wisdom to yourself.”

### passuk 5
<b>For your iniquity teaches</b> Your evil inclination [teaches] your mouth to speak such words, but you should have chosen the tongue of the crafty.

### passuk 6
<b>Let your own mouth condemn you and not I</b> That is to say: Give me an answer to my question; the result will be that your own mouth will condemn you, for it better for me that your mouth should condemn you and not I. Now this is my question:

### passuk 7
<b>Were you born before Adam</b> Heb. הראישון. Were you born before Adam? This “hey” serves as the interrogative expression. Therefore, it is vowelized with a “hattaf pattah” and its meaning is: Were you born the first one, before Adam who was formed from the earth, so that you knew to fulfill all the wisdom of the commandments of the Creator?

### passuk 8
<b>and increase</b> And bring down much [wisdom] from above to descend upon you?

### passuk 9

### passuk 10
<b>more</b> of more days than you father.

### passuk 11
<b>Are God’s consolations little for you</b> with which the Rock benefited you until now for many days, and His good thing that He gave you with pleasantness and gentleness, viz. His fatness [i.e., plenty].
<b>He gave...gently</b> Heb. לאט, he gave gently. This is a verb, not a noun. Therefore, it is vowelized half with a “kamatz” and half with a “pattah.”

### passuk 12
<b>teach you</b> Heb. יקחך, teach you, as in (Deut. 32:2), “so that my teaching (לקחי) may drip like rain.”
<b>hint</b> Heb. ירזמון, like יִרְמְזוּן ; like שַׂלְמָה שִׂמְלָה (Exod. 22:8, 26).

### passuk 13

### passuk 14
<b>What is man that he should be innocent</b> What is his strength, that he can be innocent against the Holy One, blessed be He?

### passuk 15
<b>and the heavens</b> the host of the heavens.
<b>pure</b> Heb. זכו, shine. Every expression of זַךְ is splendor.

### passuk 16
<b>Surely</b> Heb. אף, how much more.
<b>and impure</b> Heb. ונאלח,abominable and mixed. Similarly (Ps. 53: 4), “Are they all dross, altogether filthy (נאלחו)?”

### passuk 17

### passuk 18
<b>That the wise men tell</b> and confess their transgression. <b>and do not hide</b> their iniquity from their fathers. This is what I saw, and behold, I will tell you. Now where did I see it? Judah confessed and was not ashamed in the incident of Tamar. Reuben confessed and was not ashamed in the incident of Bilhah. And what was their reward?

### passuk 19
<b>To them alone the land was given</b> As a reward for this, Judah merited eternal kingship, and both took their share of the heritage, and they were not driven out of their heritage because of their iniquity, since they confessed.
<b>and no stranger passed in their midst</b> when Moses came to bless them, as it is stated (Deut. 33:6f): “Reuben shall live and not die etc. And is this for Judah?” <b>And no stranger passed in their midst</b> in the heritage of the future that is apportioned in the Book of Ezekiel (48). But...

### passuk 20
<b>All the days of a wicked man</b> who does not repent of his sin and does not confess his transgressions, all his days...
<b>he mourns</b> and grieves over his certainty of being requited for his evil that he committed. All the number of years that were laid up for the oppressor, he mourns.
The word מתחולל is an expression of mourning, but I did not hear this.

### passuk 21
<b>The voice of terrors is in his ears</b> saying that the time of his retribution has arrived.
<b>in peace</b> And when he lives in peace, then the robber will come upon him.

### passuk 22
<b>and he is destined to the sword</b> Heb. וצפוי. He is destined to the sword, and his eye to wander for bread—where should he find it?

### passuk 23
<b>He wanders</b> i.e., he is assured of wandering.
<b>He knows</b> in fact.
<b>that...is ready</b> and prepared to come to his hand, i.e., to him, and with him is the day of darkness. <b>at his hand</b> Like (Gen. 32: 14), “from what came into his hand.”

### passuk 24
<b>it overpowers him</b> The anguish is stronger than him and it will prevail over him.
<b>like a king destined for the inferno</b> Heb. לכידור. I have not found anything similar to it, but it may be interpreted by means of the interchangeable letters, “resh” with “dalet,” like (Gen. 10:3), “Ashkenaz and Riphath” in the Torah, and in Chronicles (I, 1:6): “Ashkenaz and Diphath;” and similarly (Gen. 10: 4). “Kittim and Dodanim” Here too, לַכִּידוֹר is equivalent to לַכִּידוֹד, to the king who is destined to burn (ליקוד) in the fire of Gehinnom; i.e., Sennacherib, about whom the prophet prophesied (Isa. 30: 33): “For Tophteh has been set up from yesterday, that too has been prepared for the king,” to burn his legions; (Isa. 10:16), “a burning shall burn.” Similar to this (below 41:11), “sparks of (כידודי) fire go forth”; either brands or flames.

### passuk 25

### passuk 26
<b>He runs towards Him</b> He would run toward the Creator with his neck high and upright, in order to provoke Him.
<b>the thickness of the body of his shields</b> With the power of his strength. <b>the body of</b> an expression of height, as (Ezek 16:24), “and you built yourself a platform (גב).”

### passuk 27
<b>collops of fat on his loins</b> He made a mouth on his loins, for his fat and the thickness of his blubber is folded on his loins, and they look like a sort of mouth.

### passuk 28
<b>And he dwelt in ruined cities</b> So is the custom of haughty people, to build ruins for a name.

### passuk 29
<b>and his possessions will not remain</b> They will not be preserved for long.
<b>neither will...bend</b> Heb. יטה, [like] ינטה, like (I Sam. 8:3), “and they turned (ויטו) after gain.” They themselves turned (וינטו). It means that they did not bend from heaven to earth.
<b>the gratification of their desire</b> Heb. מנלם, the granting of their desire and the fulfillment of their plans. It is like two words, מן להם. מן means their preparation, like (Dan. 1:5), “And the king prepared (וימן) for them.” Similar to it is (I Sam. 13:21), “a file (הפצירה פים),” in two words. [The analogy is obscure.] (Isa. 33:7), “Behold I will appear to them (אראלם),” which Jonathan renders: I will appear to them. So it appears to me, and Menachem supports me. Another explanation: מִנְלָם is an expression of (Isa. 33:1), “when you finish (כנלתך) dealing treacherously,” in which the “nun” is a radical that sometimes is omitted, an expression of completion. It will not bend to the ground to be freed from a decree of destruction.

### passuk 30
<b>and he will turn away</b> from the world.
<b>by the breath of His mouth</b> Of the Ruler of the world. This is an ellipsis, Others interpret this to mean: because of the breath of his mouth that was guilty of speaking lies.

### passuk 31
<b>will not believe</b> He who was misled by futility will not believe that his recompense and his toil shall be futility, like (Ruth 4:7), “and concerning exchange (התמורה).”

### passuk 32
<b>Before his time</b> his recompense will be complete [and will cease] from growing and prospering anymore, like (Gen. 50:3), “were fulfilled for him,” i.e., they were completed.
<b>and his branches</b> His bent-over branches. All branches of a tree resemble a dome.

### passuk 33
