### passuk 1
Then Job answered and said:

### passuk 2
Of a truth I know that it is so; And how can man be just with God?

### passuk 3
If one should desire to contend with Him, He could not answer Him one of a thousand.

### passuk 4
He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength; Who hath hardened himself against Him, and prospered?

### passuk 5
Who removeth the mountains, and they know it not, When He overturneth them in His anger.

### passuk 6
Who shaketh the earth out of her place, And the pillars thereof tremble.

### passuk 7
Who commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; And sealeth up the stars.

### passuk 8
Who alone stretcheth out the heavens, And treadeth upon the waves of the sea.

### passuk 9
Who maketh the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, And the chambers of the south.

### passuk 10
Who doeth great things past finding out; Yea, marvellous things without number.

### passuk 11
Lo, He goeth by me, and I see Him not. He passeth on also, but I perceive Him not.

### passuk 12
Behold, He snatcheth away, who can hinder Him? Who will say unto Him: ‘What doest Thou?’

### passuk 13
God will not withdraw His anger; The helpers of Rahab did stoop under Him.

### passuk 14
How much less shall I answer Him, And choose out my arguments with Him?

### passuk 15
Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer; I would make supplication to Him that contendeth with me.

### passuk 16
If I had called, and He had answered me; Yet would I not believe that He would hearken unto my voice—

### passuk 17
He that would break me with a tempest, And multiply my wounds without cause;

### passuk 18
That would not suffer me to take my breath, But fill me with bitterness.

### passuk 19
If it be a matter of strength, lo, He is mighty! And if of justice, who will appoint me a time? .

### passuk 20
Though I be righteous, mine own mouth shall condemn me; Though I be innocent, He shall prove me perverse.

### passuk 21
I am innocent—I regard not myself, I despise my life.

### passuk 22
It is all one—therefore I say: He destroyeth the innocent and the wicked.

### passuk 23
If the scourge slay suddenly, He will mock at the calamity of the guiltless.

### passuk 24
The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; He covereth the faces of the judges thereof; If it be not He, who then is it?

### passuk 25
Now my days are swifter than a runner; They flee away, they see no good.

### passuk 26
They are passed away as the swift ships; As the vulture that swoopeth on the prey.

### passuk 27
If I say: ‘I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad countenance, and be of good cheer’,

### passuk 28
I am afraid of all my pains, I know that Thou wilt not hold me guiltless.

### passuk 29
I shall be condemned; Why then do I labour in vain?

### passuk 30
If I wash myself with snow water, And make my hands never so clean;

### passuk 31
Yet wilt Thou plunge me in the ditch, And mine own clothes shall abhor me.

### passuk 32
For He is not a man, as I am, that I should answer Him, That we should come together in judgment.

### passuk 33
There is no arbiter betwixt us, That might lay his hand upon us both.

### passuk 34
Let Him take His rod away from me, And let not His terror make me afraid;

### passuk 35
Then would I speak, and not fear Him; For I am not so with myself.
