### passuk 1
<b>I made a covenant with my eyes</b> not to gaze upon a married woman.
<b>and why should I gaze upon a virgin?</b> Why should I gaze upon her? Such was Job’s piety, not to lay an eye even on an unmarried woman. [He would say,] “Perhaps, after a time, she will be married, and I will find myself attracted to her.” So is [this verse] explained in Avoth D’Rabbi Nathan (2:5).

### passuk 2
<b>Now what is the portion etc.</b> that He recompensed me so?

### passuk 3
<b>Is not misfortune, for the unjust</b> He deserves it, not I.
<b>and deliverance</b> Heb. ונכר, after the pattern of (Obadiah 1:12) “[And] you should not have looked on the day of your brother on the day of his being delivered (נכרו).”

### passuk 4
<b>and count all my steps</b> and see whether I went with falsehood.

### passuk 5
<b>hastened</b> Heb. ותחש, and hurried, like (Isa. 60:22), “I will hasten it (אחישנה)”; (Ps. 90:10) “for it is soon (חיש) cut off.”

### passuk 6

### passuk 7
<b>wrong</b> Heb. מאום, that is a blemish, a shameful thing. This “alef” is written but not read, in the Great Masorah, and it is of the form of (Exod. 5:7), “You shall not continue (תאספון).” If I did this, I would deserve that this curse come upon me.

### passuk 8
<b>may I sow and another eat, and my produce be uprooted</b> their roots should be torn up.

### passuk 9
<b>and if I lurked at my neighbor’s doorway</b> for his wife, He should requite me...

### passuk 10
<b>may my wife grind for someone else</b> Our Sages explained this as an expression of sexual intercourse, as in (Jud. 16:21), “and he did grind in the prison house.”

### passuk 11
<b>For that is lewdness</b> and I feared that if I committed it, that <b>it is iniquity deserving punishment</b> iniquity for which judgment of suffering is fit to come.

### passuk 12
<b>and it uproots all my grain</b> i.e., this fire. Therefore, I refrained from committing [this sin]. When he speaks with an expression of uprooting, he says תְּשָרֵש, and to express roots, he also uses תְּשָרֵש. Similarly, יְשׁרָשוּ is an expression of uprooting and יְשׁרָשוּ is an expression of a root.

### passuk 13

### passuk 14
<b>then what will I do etc.</b> I took this to heart, and when He visits, what will I answer Him?

### passuk 15
<b>and form us both in the womb?</b> I in my mother’s womb and he in his mother’s womb—did not One creator form us?

### passuk 16
<b>I cause...to fail</b> in that I did not fulfill her desire, which is “failure of the eyes.” One who desires and does not achieve is called “failure of the eyes.”

### passuk 17

### passuk 18
<b>For, from my youth it raised me</b> This virtue [raised me] as a father who raises me and teaches me. So did the uprightness of my heart teach me from my youth.
<b>and from my mother’s womb I led it</b> This trait.

### passuk 19

### passuk 20

### passuk 21

### passuk 22
<b>from its shoulder blade</b> That is the width of the shoulder.
<b>from its bone</b> That is the upper bone, which is round as a reed (קנה), and because it is round as a reed, it is called so.

### passuk 23
<b>fear to me</b> His misfortune, which He brought upon the wicked, was fear in my eyes; therefore, I refrained from doing it.

### passuk 24
<b>my hope</b> Heb. כסלי, like (8:14), “whose confidence (כסלו) shall be cut off.” My hope and my thought, and because the kidneys are on the flanks (כסלים), and the kidneys advise, the thought is called כֶּסֶל.
<b>and to jewelry</b> A gathering of gold and treasures.
<b>I said, ‘My confidence.’</b> therewith to strengthen myself over the poor.

### passuk 25
<b>If I rejoiced because my wealth</b> I did not behave with joy in the presence of the poor so as not to make them envious of me.

### passuk 26
<b>If I saw light shining</b> The sun in the orbit of its might, and its brightness.
<b>and the moon becoming brighter</b> Heb. יקר. Progressively brighter, like (Zech. 14:6), “bright (יקרות) light”; (Ps. 37:20), “like the glory (כיקר) off the meadows.”

### passuk 27
<b>And my heart was secretly enticed</b> to the sun and the moon, saying that they are gods, like some heathens, who have gone astray (and worship) all the host of heaven.

### passuk 28

### passuk 29

### passuk 30
<b>but I did not allow my palate to sin</b> to provoke my enemy and to sue him for money that he does not owe me, in order to adjure him and to ask for the soul of my enemy with an oath.

### passuk 31
<b>We will not be sated</b> Because of the hatred that they bore against me for burdening them with hospitality toward guests.

### passuk 32
<b>to the road</b> The doors of my house were not inside and enclosed by a gatehouse outside, or surrounded by corners to stop the wayfarers from coming, but open to the crossroads so that whoever wishes to come may do so.

### passuk 33
<b>in my hiding place</b> Heb. בחבי, like בְּמַחַבוֹאִי.

### passuk 34
<b>For I would subdue</b> Originally I would subdue a great multitude of wicked men, but now, even among the Chaldeans—“This people has never been” (Isa. 23:13).

### passuk 35
<b>behold my inscription; may the Almighty bear witness for me</b> Would that the Omnipresent bear witness for me in judgment, as He wrote concerning me (1:8): “For there is none like him on earth, a sincere and upright man, God-fearing.” Also Moses, who wrote his Book and my Book, will bear witness concerning me. (Another explanation:) This is what Job says, “Give it to inscribe me and my virtue.”
<b>may the Almighty answer me</b> for this request.
<b>and may my opponent write a book</b> May he too write a book to contend with me.

### passuk 36
<b>Would I not carry him</b> The writer of the book.
<b>bind it</b> I will bind the book to me as crowns.

### passuk 37
<b>I will tell him the number of my steps</b> to that man.

### passuk 38
<b>If my soil complains about me</b> concerning the gleanings, the forgotten sheaves, and the end [of the field], as well as tithes, [claiming] that I did not extract tithes properly.
<b>and its furrows weep together</b> that I plowed with an ox and with a donkey together.

### passuk 39
<b>without money</b> to hire workers and to oppress them [by not paying them]. Another explanation. This refers to the second tithe, concerning which it is written (Deut. 14:25): “And you shall tie the money in your hand.”
<b>and I caused pain to its owner</b> The sharecropper who tills it.

### passuk 40
<b>noisome weeds</b> Heb. באשה, (a malodorous plant) like בְּאֻשִׁים (Isa. 5:2). And if I did not do so, may thistles emerge instead of wheat. (Rabbi Oshia taught: The Torah teaches you practical advice, that in a field beset with thistles it is advisable to sow wheat, and in a field beset with weeds, it is advisable to sow barley. This is the reading of Yalkut.) Now what is the reason? “Instead of wheat, thistles shall emerge.”
Until this point, he repeatedly prophesies many prophecies, and you say: Job’s words are ended? Rather, Job says as follows, “If I have not done so, may Job’s words be ended, and may he have no pretext for saying before You (Deut. 26:13), ‘I have cleared away what is holy.’” I saw this in the Pesikta of the portion עשר תעשר (ibid. 14), explained in this manner from these verses.
