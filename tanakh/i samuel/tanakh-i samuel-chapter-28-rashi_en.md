<b>Shmuel had died.</b> It was already stated, "and Shmuel died,"<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">Above 25:1.</i> but since [Scripture] came to speak about Shaul, that he had to ask of a medium of <span>אוֹב</span>,<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">See Maseches Sanhedrin 65b for description of <span>אוֹב</span>.</i>, it begins by stating, "and Shmuel had died," for had he been alive, Shaul would have inquired of him. But since Shaul had abolished the <span>אוֹב</span> mediums,<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">Pursuant to the prohibition stated in Vayikra 19:31. Shaul removed the mediums after Shmuel died. Before that, it was not necessary for him to do so because while Shmuel was alive, prophecy was widespread in Yisroel, so no one sought out the medium of <span>אוֹב</span> or <span>יׅדְּעֹנִי</span>.</i> he had to seek out find an <span>אוֹב</span> medium.
<b>And all of Yisroel mourned him and buried him in Romoh, in his city.</b> And all Yisroel mourned him and buried him in Romoh, and each person mourned him in his own city; and 'in his city' is connected with 'and they mourned him,' i.e., they mourned and buried him in Romoh, and each person mourned him in his own city.<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">In the same manner as he was mourned in his home town of Romoh.</i>

<b>Nor through the Urim.</b> Because he had slain [the kohanim of] Nov,<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote">See above Chapter 22.</i> the City of Kohanim, he was not answered.

<b>Shaul disguised himself.</b> He changed his clothes, and similarly, 'disguise yourself [<span>הִתְחַפֵּשׂ</span>] and come into battle,'<sup>6</sup><i class="footnote">II Melochim 22:30.</i> and similarly, 'its intensity makes me change [<span>יׅתְחַפֵּשׂ</span>] my clothing.'<sup>7</sup><i class="footnote">Iyov 30:18.</i> And so did Targum Yonoson render, 'and Shaul changed.'
<b>They came to the woman at night.</b> [They actually came] during the daytime, but because of their distress, it seemed to them as night. So did R. Tanchuma expound.

<b>She screamed loudly.</b> For she saw him ascending not in the usual manner<sup>8</sup><i class="footnote">Radak suggests that the moment the woman saw the manner in which Shmuel came up, she realized that the man who had come to her was Shaul, and that is why she screamed.</i> of those who ascend [through the <span>אוֹב</span> medium], for when one conjures up [the dead], they ascend with their feet upward, while this one was ascending with his head upward, in honor of Shaul.<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote">Vayikra Rabboh 26:7.</i>

### passuk 13
<b>I saw a godly man rising from the earth.</b> Two angels, Moshe and Shmuel,<sup>10</sup><i class="footnote">This is alluded to in the words <span>אִישׁ זֲקִן עֹלֶה וְהוּא עֹטֶה מְעִיל</span>, ‘an old man ascends [i.e., Moshe] and he is wearing a robe [i.e., Shmuel].’</i> for Shmuel feared, 'Perhaps I am being summoned for judgement,' and he therefore brought Moshe up with him,<sup>11</sup><i class="footnote">Each person must face judgment within twelve months of his death. Shmuel wanted that Moshe testify on his behalf.</i> as it is stated in [Maseches] Chagiga and Ta'anis.<sup>12</sup><i class="footnote"></i>

### passuk 14
<b>What does he look like.</b> Three things were said regarding <span>אוֹב</span>: The one who conjures him [the dead] up, sees him, but does not hear his voice; the one who inquires of him, hears him, but does not see him, and therefore, he [Shaul] asked, 'What does he look like?', and the others neither see or hear him.
<b>He is garbed in a robe.</b> For he was accustomed to wear a robe, as it is stated, "and his mother would make him a small robe."<sup>13</sup><i class="footnote">Above 2:19.</i> He was buried with his robe, and so he arose. And so in the future [Resurrection of the Dead], they will rise with their garments.

### passuk 15
<b>Have you disturbed me.</b> You have frightened me.<sup>14</sup><i class="footnote">The Midrash explains that Shmuel feared that his day of judgment had come. See above verse—Radak</i>
<b>Neither through the prophets nor through dreams.</b> But he did not mention to him the Urim and Tumim, even though he had inquired of them, as it is stated above,<sup>15</sup><i class="footnote">Verse 6.</i> because he was ashamed of it, since he had slain [the kohanim of] Nov, the City of the Kohanim.<sup>16</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Berachos 12b and Rashi there.</i>
<b>Therefore I called upon you.</b> An expression meaning, 'and I have been summoned after you,' as in, "I was summoned [<span>נִקְראׁ נִקְרֵיתִי</span>] on Mount Gilbo'a,"<sup>17</sup><i class="footnote">II Shmuel 1:6.</i> and as in "and there chanced [<span>נִקְרָא</span>] an unscrupulous man."<sup>18</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. 20:1.</i> It was necessary for me to be summoned after you, that you let me know what I should do.

### passuk 16
<b>But why do you ask me.</b> Since you have inquired of the living prophets.
<b>And become your adversary.</b> He has become the supporter of the one whose adversary you are.<sup>19</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., Dovid.</i>
<b>Adversary.</b> An expression meaning an enemy. In Scripture there are many [examples of the word <span>עׇרֶךָ</span>], "and the world will become full with enemies [<span>עׇרִים</span>]";<sup>20</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshay 14:21.</i> "and I will destroy your enemies [<span>עׇרֶיךָ</span>]";<sup>21</sup><i class="footnote">Micha 5:13.</i> "may this dream be upon your enemies and its interpretation upon your adversaries [<span>לְעָרָךְ</span>]";<sup>22</sup><i class="footnote">Daniel 4:16.</i>

### passuk 17
<b>To your fellow, to Dovid.</b> But during his lifetime, he [Shmuel] did not mention his name [Dovid] to him, only 'and He gave it to your fellow who is better than you'<sup>23</sup><i class="footnote">Above 15:28.</i> because he feared that he [Shaul], might kill him,<sup>24</sup><i class="footnote">Now however, that Shmuel was in the <span>עוֹלָם הָאֶמֶת</span> [=World of Truth] there was nothing to fear speaking the complete truth.</i> because he had anointed him [Dovid] as king.

### passuk 19
<b>You and your sons will be with me.</b> In my abode.<sup>25</sup><i class="footnote">See Maseches Berachos 12b. By saying this to Shaul, Shmuel indicated to Shaul that he had been forgiven by the Heavenly Court for having slain the kohanim of Nov, and has been given place among the righteous.</i>
