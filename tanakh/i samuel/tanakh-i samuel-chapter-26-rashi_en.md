<b>As Hachem lives.</b> Some say that he swore to his temptation;<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote"> The use of swearing to ward off temptation is done by many Tzadikim. For example, Avrohom swore [Bereishis 14:22-23] that he will not take the spoils of victory after defeating the four kings. It was Dovid’s inclination to kill Shaul for trying to kill him. He therefore swore that he will not kill Shaul.—See Midrash Tanchuma Beha’aloscha 10.</i> others say that he swore to Avishai, that if you kill this righteous man [Shaul], I shall mingle your blood with his blood.
<b>Hachem will strike him.</b> Will bring his death prematurely.<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">Like Novol.—Radak.</i>
<b>Or his day will come.</b> The day in which he is destined to die.<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">Is in the very near future.—Radak.</i>

<b>Who has incited you against me.</b> To hate me. Every expression of <span>הֲסָתָה</span> means setting;<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">See Devarim 13:7, where Rashi states ‘<span>הַסָּתָה</span> always denotes inciting.’</i><i>ametement</i> in O.F.
<b>Let my offering be pleasing to Him.</b> He will accept with mercy my prayer to turn your anger away from me.
<b>For they have driven me away.</b> From Eretz Yisroel.
<b>Go serve other gods.</b> Whoever goes out of Eretz Yisroel to other lands during the time of the Temple is considered as though he worshipped idols.<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote">See Maseches Kesubos 110b.</i> Targum Yonoson renders, 'Go, Dovid, among nations who worship idols.'<sup>6</sup><i class="footnote">Or the reference to idol worship means that by causing Dovid to flee from his enemies made him abandon his Torah study thereby moving him closer to idolatry.</i>

<b>As the partridge.</b> A bird named <span>קוֹרֵא</span>, and in O.F. <i>perdriz;</i> and similarly, "as the partridge calls together [offspring] it did not bear"<sup>7</sup><i class="footnote">Yirmiyahu 17:11.</i> and it seeks the nests of other birds, and sits on their eggs.<sup>8</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Chulin 140b. Dovid compared Shaul’s fate to that of the partridge. Just as the partridge seeks the nests of other birds but the young return to their natural mother and the partridge is unable to keep them, so too, Shaul who chased after Dovid will be unable to keep his kingship.</i>

<b>Each man.</b> To each righteous man.<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote"> Who does as I have done.—Radak. Dovid was hinting to <span>ה׳</span> that just as Shaul’s life was precious in his eyes, so too may his life be precious in the eyes of <span>ה׳</span>.</i>
