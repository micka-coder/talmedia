<b>s They were swayed.</b> Themselves.<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote"> <span>וַיִטּוּ</span> is in the <span>קַל</span> [simple] form.</i>
<b>[They] perverted.</b> Something else, i.e., justice.<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote"><span>וַיַטּוּ</span> is in the <span>הִפֽעִיל</span> [causative] form.</i> Our Rabbis said<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Shabbos 56a.</i> that Shmuel's sons did not sin. They merely did not follow in their father's ways. Their father would travel to all places in Yisroel, and judge them in their cities. But they did not do so,<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">They did not travel, but rather settled in <span>בְּאֵר שֶׁבַע</span> and would summon litigants to their court. Because the litigants had to pay additional travel expenses to go to <span>בְּאֵר שֶׁבַע</span>, many chose to forgo their claims and thereby corrupting the justice system.</i> in order to increase the income of their agents and scribes.

<b>The matter was wrong.</b> Because they said, "to judge us like all the nations."<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote"> Shmuel was not displeased at the Bnei Yisroel’s request, because the Torah explicitly permits the institution of the monarchy in Devarim 17:15. It therefore seems that seeking to appoint a new king, now that the nation had settled in Eretz Yisroel was appropriate. What disturbed Shmuel was that the motive behind the request was not a desire to fulfill a mitzvah of appointing a king. Rather, they were complaining and rejecting Shmuel’s leadership [below verse 8] and their reason for seeking to appoint a king was because of their desire to be “…like all the nations…”</i>

<b>But warn them.<sup>6</sup><i class="footnote">See Bereishis 43:3.</i></b> Warn them that the fear of their king be upon them.<sup>7</sup><i class="footnote">In order to impress Bnei Yisroel with awe for the monarchy, i.e., the king’s position, Shmuel was instructed to teach them the honor due to a king of Yisroel.</i>
