<b>Each right eye.</b> Explain it literally.<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">As a symbol of everlasting defeat.</i> But the Midrash Aggadah [explains it figuratively, that he said,] "Bring me your Torah scroll which was given by the right hand [of God],<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">See Devarim 33:2.</i> and I will burn it, because He wrote in it, "Neither an Ammonite nor a Moavite may enter [into Hachem's community]."<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">Devarim 23:4. Therefore, Nochosh said that he cannot accept any form of peace treaty with the Bnei Yisroel when the Torah specifically forbids to seek peace with Ammon. In Devarim 23:7 the Torah stated with regard to Ammon and Moav, “You shall not seek their peace or welfare, all your days, forever.” Nochosh therefore wanted to burn the Torah.</i>
<b>A sign of shame.</b> An insult.

<b>He counted them in Bezek.</b> Our Rabbis said that he counted them using earthenware shards.<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote"> See Maseches Yoma 22b. According to this rendering, Bezek is not a name of a place, but rather a description of the means used by which to count the people.</i> Another explanation is that <span>בְּבָזֶק</span> means 'with pebbles,' i.e., he took a pebble from each one, and counted them, similar to, "And he counted them with lambs,"<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote">Below 15:4.</i> i.e., he took a lamb from each one, and counted them with the lambs, just as they would count them with half shekels.<sup>6</sup><i class="footnote"> See Rashi Ibid.</i> Targum reders, in the verse, "as one who loads a pebble [<span>אֶבֶן</span>] for throwing in a slingshot,"<sup>7</sup><i class="footnote"> Mishlei 26:8.</i> as one who loads a <span>בִּזְקָא</span> into a slingshot. And in [Midrash] Yelam'denu, "And he counted them with lambs," [is explained as,] "when they were poor, [they were counted] with pebbles and when they became rich, [they were counted] with lambs. Another explanation is that <span>בָזֶק</span> is the name of a place, mentioned in Shoftim, "they found Adoni Bezek in Bezek."<sup>8</sup><i class="footnote">Shoftim 1:5.</i>

<b>And Shmuel said, "…and renew the kingdom there."</b> Because at first there was opposition in the matter, but now they unanimously agreed.<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote"> Shmuel merely invited them to Gilgol; it was not a command. See above 9:9 for a similar expression <span>וְנֵלְכָה</span>. However, now that Shaul saved the people of Yoveish Gilad from the Ammonites; all the people rallied behind him and accepted him as their king.</i>
