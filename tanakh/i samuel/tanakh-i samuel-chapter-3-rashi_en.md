<b>Was rare.</b> Was withheld,<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">It was therefore considered precious and dear [=<span>יָקָר</span>].</i> as in, "and a man of understanding speaks sparingly <span>]</span><span>יֲקר</span><span>[</span>",<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">Mishlei 17:27.</i> meaning that who speaks sparingly is an understanding man.
<b>Prophetic vision was not widespread.</b> Prophecy was not revealed.<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">Not only were prophetic visions rare in those days, but even when they occurred they were not clear and concise, but rather cryptic and vague. Also, the prophecy that was received was of a private nature and not required by the people, so there was no need to reveal those visions. The prophets therefore kept their experiences to themselves and prophetic vision was rare and not widespread.</i><span>נִפְרָץ</span> is an expression similar to, "and you shall spread [<span>וּפָרַצְתָּ</span>] westward and eastward.<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">Bereishis 28:14.</i>

### passuk 3
<b>And Shmuel was lying.</b> In his place, in the court of the Levites who watch in the Temple. According to Targum Yonoson: "And Shmuel was lying in the court of the Levites."
<b>In the Temple of Hachem.</b> Where the Ark of God was.

### passuk 4
<b>Hachem called.</b> And a voice emanated from the Temple of God, from the Holy of Holies, which called, "Shmuel!" The end of the above verse<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote">As is indicated by the <span>אֶתְנַחְתָּא</span> under the word <span>שֹׁכֵכ</span> to separate it from ‘<span>בְּהֵיכַל ה</span>.</i> is connected to the verse that follows. This is what is inferred by the verse, "the Lord thunders wonderously with His voice."<sup>6</sup><i class="footnote">Iyov 37:5.</i> Eili was a Kohen, and was watching from within, while Shmuel was a Levite and lying without. Yet, the voice [of '<span>ה</span>] jumped over Eili to Shmuel.

### passuk 7
<b>[Shmuel] had not yet known Hachem.</b> He had not yet recognized the nature of the prophetic voice.<sup>7</sup><i class="footnote">He was thus unfamiliar with the ways ‘<span>ה</span> calls man, and he therefore thought that the voice was Eili’s.</i> Every time the word '<span>טֶרֶם</span>' appears in Scripture, it means 'not yet,' as rendered by the Targum '<span>עַד לָא</span>' [not yet]. It does not mean 'before.' This verse proves it. And another [proof of this] is the verse <span>כִּי טֶרֶם תִּירְאוּן</span> which is rendered as "that you do not yet fear,"<sup>8</sup><i class="footnote">Shemos 9:30.</i> is a more explicit verse proving this. Also, <span>וְכֹל שִֹיחַ הַשָֹּדֶה טֶרֶם יִהְיֶה בָאָרֶץ</span> ["all plants of the field were not yet on the earth"].<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote">Bereishis 2:5.</i>

<b>And Shmuel said, "Speak."</b> He did not mention the Name of the Deity as Eili had commanded him, because he said [to himself], 'Perhaps it is another voice.'<sup>10</sup><i class="footnote">See Maseches Shabbos 113b.</i>

### passuk 11
<b>To do something.</b> This refers to the capture of the Ark by the Philistines.<sup>11</sup><i class="footnote">Also, this may be referring to the destruction of the Mishkon in Shiloh which happened after the Ark was captured.</i>
<b>Will ring.</b> An expression similar to [<span>צִלְצָלִים</span>], cymbals, <i>tintiner,</i> in O. F.

### passuk 12
<b>I will begin to destroy.</b> On that day, My decree upon Eili's family will begin, for Chofni and Pinchas shall die, and from then on, I shall finish my decree and complete it upon them from generation to generation, and cause them to die as young men at the age of eighteen years.
<b>I will begin to destroy.</b> <i>Commencant e espleiant,</i> in O. F.

### passuk 13
<b>That his sons were blaspheming themselves.</b> It should properly state, 'blaspheming Me' but Scripture euphemized.<sup>12</sup><i class="footnote"> See Mechilta Beshalach 15:7 for a listing of other places where Scripture euphemized out of reverence to ‘<span>ה</span>. Ralbag, however, interprets this verse that “they [Bnei Yisroel] cursed them [the sons of Eili].”</i>
<b>Blaspheming.</b> Meaning, acting irreverantly, and similarly, every curse [<span>קְלָלָה</span>] is an expression of irreverence and disgrace.
<b>He did not censure.</b> I.e., he did not darken [<span>כהה</span>] their faces by removing them from their high positions.

<b>Such shall [God] do to you.</b> Like that very curse, that you shall not have worthy children. And that curse actually befell him even though he did tell him. <b>And did not withhold.</b> From here [the Sages concluded]: A curse of a wise man, even though pronounced on condition, will be realized.<sup>13</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Makos 11a.</i>

### passuk 18
<b>He is Hachem.</b> He is the Master and everything is His.

### passuk 21
<b>For Hachem revealed Himself to Shmuel.</b> Because Scripture stated above, "The word of Hachem was rare in those days,"<sup>14</sup><i class="footnote">Above 3:1.</i> it states here that from now on, for Shmuel's sake, He revealed Himself repeatedly.<sup>15</sup><i class="footnote">Not only to Shmuel, but others also began to prophesy.</i>
