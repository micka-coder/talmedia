<b>Whose ox have I taken?</b> For my work.
<b>Whose donkey have I taken?</b> When I used to travel from city to city to judge them concerning their matters, I used to travel on my donkey, although I should have taken theirs.<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote"> See Bamidbar Rabbah 18:10. And when I brought a sacrifice for their sake, I should have taken their ox. Shmuel took this extra precaution because he witnessed how severely Eili’s sons were punished for having abused the privileges of their office. He therefore avoided any action that could be misconstrued as resembling their behavior.</i><sup>3</sup><i class="footnote"> Devarim 28:33.</i>
<b>Whom have I oppressed?</b> Every expression of <span>מְרַצֶּה</span> which follows <span>עשֶׁק</span> [robbery], is an expression of "robbed and oppressed,<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote"> 23b. The other two places in which the holy spirit entered the earthly court are in the court of Sheim and in the court of Shlomo.</i> one who robs the poor and oppresses them.

<b>And Yiphtoch.</b> Here are three insignificant leaders with three world-important leaders: Moshe, Aharon and Shmuel, to teach you that the insignificant leader in his generation is equal to the important leader in his generation. Every court which is appointed over the generation, must be followed as though its [members] were the mightiest of the nobility.<sup>8</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid., 25b. Shmuel indicated to the people that every generation must regard its sages and leaders with the same respect they would give to Moshe, Aharon or Shmuel. Therefore, Yiphtoch in his generation was equal to Moshe in his generation. See Rashi in Devarim 19:17.</i>

### passuk 16
<b>Stand up and see…</b> And just as through my prayer, I am able to change the seasons, similarly, if a war befell you, my prayer would have the power to protect you against the enemy, and you had no need to ask for a king during my lifetime,<sup>10</sup><i class="footnote"> Shmuel demonstrated to the nation how unnecessary their request for a king was. Just as ‘<span>ה</span> responded immediately to Shmuel’s prayers for rain, so too would ‘<span>ה</span> answer his prayers to save the Bnei Yisroel from their enemies.</i> even though I am old.

### passuk 17
<b>Is today not the [season of the] wheat harvest?</b> And rain is a sign of a curse,<sup>11</sup><i class="footnote"> Maseches Ta’anis 12b.</i> and the Holy One, Blessed is He, is reluctant to visit punishment unnecessarily. Nonetheless, I have power, and I shall call to '<span>ה</span>, and He will make it thunder and rain.
<b>Then you will know and see.</b> That it was unnecessary for you to ask for a king and to show disrespect towards me.

<b>And as for me, far be it from me.</b> Since you will do your part by returning to '<span>ה</span>, I also, far be it from me to stop praying on your behalf.<sup>14</sup><i class="footnote"> From this verse, the Gemara in Maseches Berachos 12b, derives, that if a person knows that his prayers will be answered if he prays for mercy for his fellow but refrains from doing so, he is considered to have sinned.</i>
