<b>Now I might perish one day.</b> Perhaps he will ambush me and suddenly attack me.<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">Dovid did not trust Shaul and was convinced that he was laying a trap for him by asking him to remain.—Metzudas Dovid</i>

<b>Why should your servant remain…</b> And be a burden to you.<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">Probably, Dovid did not want to live with idolaters and therefore asked in a diplomatic fashion, e.g., ‘Why should your servant be a burden to you,’ to settle in a separate city.</i>

<b>Days and four months.</b> The minimum [number] of days is two. It is impossible to explain this word, '<span>יָמִים</span>' as a year<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">As we find <span>יָמִים</span> to mean ‘year’ in Bereishis 41:1.</i> because Dovid did not go to Achish until Shmuel had died, and Shaul only reigned after Shmuel's death<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore <span>יָמִים</span> is to be taken literally, i.e., days.</i> four months, as we learned in Seder Olam. Also [this can be deduced from the following:] the number of Eili's years [forty years which he judged Yisroel],<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote">Above 4:18.</i> and the twenty years that the Ark was in Kiryas Ye'arim<sup>6</sup><i class="footnote">Above 7:2.</i> total sixty years. Subtract from that Shmuel's fifty-two years, plus one year from his conception, with these four months, plus the seven years which Dovid reigned in Chevron<sup>7</sup><i class="footnote">II Shmuel 2:5.</i> before he brought the Ark from Kiryas Ye'arim. This [calculation] discloses that Shaul reigned after Shmuel's death but four months.

### passuk 8
<b>Dovid…would go up.</b> This is the present tense, i.e., he was always accustomed doing this.
<b>In the direction of Shur.</b> From the entrance of Shur.

### passuk 10
<b>Where did you raid.</b> The '<span>ל</span>' is interchangeable with a '<span>נ</span>' [so the word <span>אֶל</span>=<span>אָן</span> which means 'where'], as in "he prepared a large chamber [<span>נִשְׁכָּה</span>],"<sup>8</sup><i class="footnote">Nechemyoh 13:7.</i> in the Book of Ezra, meaning the equivalent of <span>לִשְׁכָּה</span> [=chamber].
