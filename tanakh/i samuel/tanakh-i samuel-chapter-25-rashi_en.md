<b>There was a man in Ma'on.</b> The name of the city.<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">Not to be mistook for <span>מָעוֹן</span> meaning a dwelling, as in Tehillim 26:8, but rather, it is the city mentioned in Yehoshua 15:55, and it was located in Yehudah’s territory, the tribe of which Novol was a member.</i>
<b>Whose business.</b> His cattle and possessions.
<b>Wealthy.</b> [Literally 'very great'], meaning wealthy.

<b>So.</b> So will he be [shearing] in the coming year.<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi in Bereishis 18:10.</i> So shall be in the coming year, living and enduring.) Another version is: <b>So to the living.</b> Say this concerning his meal and his wine that you will see, "So is befitting a live man, i.e., an active and esteemed man," as in "…was a live man of many heroic deeds,"<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">II Shmuel 23:20.</i> [i.e.] alive and active in all his deeds.
<b>May it always be so.</b> Good and enduring.

<b>For we have come on a festive day.</b> Relying on the party and festive day which you have, we have now come to ask.<sup>8</sup><i class="footnote">Without burdening you additionally because you already have prepared a lavish feast.—Radak.</i> Another explanation is, that this was the eve of Rosh Hashonoh [so they said,] "We are in need of a holiday feast."<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote">Rosh Hashanoh is a holiday in which Scripture [Nechemyah 8:10] stresses to send food to the needy.</i>

### passuk 9
<b>And spoke to Novol in accordance with all these words, in Dovid's name, and then they rested.</b> They were tired from traveling, yet they were quick to execute Dovid's command, and did not rest until they spoke to him, and afterward they rested. Targum Yonson renders, however, and they ceased, i.e., they stopped speaking further, until they would hear his reply.

### passuk 10
<b>Who is Dovid.</b> Of what importance is he that I should give him mine? Is he not descended from Rus the Moavite?<sup>10</sup><i class="footnote">And as such, Novol questioned Dovid’s right to the throne. See Talmud Yerushalmi Sanhedrin 2:3.</i>

<b>He is too wicked a person to speak to.</b> Our master is such a base person<sup>13</sup><i class="footnote">Or, the phrase refers to Dovid, that Dovid is such a base person that he is capable of attacking without warning.—Radak.</i> so that I cannot tell him that which I am telling you, because he will become angry with us.

### passuk 18
<b>Prepared.</b> Targum Yonoson renders <span>תַּכְבְּרָא</span>, filled with finely cut meat and eggs; farcides in O.F., as we learned in [Maseches] Pesachim:<sup>14</sup><i class="footnote"></i> And he places the feet and its intestines inside [the Paschal lamb]; Rabbi Tarfon calls it <span>תַּכְבְּרָא</span>. That which is inside, is placed outside,<sup>15</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., <span>תַּכְבְּרָא</span> is a combination of two words <span>תּוֹךְ</span> [=inside] and <span>בְּרָא</span> [=outside].</i> according to Rabbi Akiva, who says that the intestines are hung outside of it.

### passuk 23

<b>My master, with me lies the sin.</b> First she said this so that he would pay attention to her words.<sup>18</sup><i class="footnote">And thereby protect her household from Dovid and his men.</i> At the end, however, she told him the truth, that "I, your handmaid, did not see my master's youths."<sup>19</sup><i class="footnote">Below, verse 25.</i>

### passuk 27

### passuk 28
<b>For Adonoy will surely make for my master an everlasting house.</b> To be king over Yisroel. Therefore, let no evil be found in you. It is therefore not fitting for you to do anything contrary to the law, to spread evil talk concerning your kingship.

### passuk 29
<b>Slingshot.</b> A wide piece of leather, with an indentation in the middle of the sling, into which one places the stone.

### passuk 30

<b>That this not be…an obstacle.</b> As a stumbling block, as in, 'and the stumbling [<span>לְפִיק</span>] of the knees';<sup>21</sup><i class="footnote">Nachum 2:11.</i> for had you done this, you would not be able to open your mouth to reprove anyone in future generations, concerning bloodshed.
<b>And that my master has avenged himself.</b> That you avenge yourself.

### passuk 32

### passuk 33
<b>Who prevented me.</b> You stopped me, as in, 'You shall not stop [<span>תִכְלָא</span>] your mercy,'<sup>22</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim 40:12.</i> [and] 'will not stop [<span>יׅכְלֶה</span>] you.'<sup>23</sup><i class="footnote">Bereishis 23:6.</i>

### passuk 38
<b>After ten days.</b> There were seven days of mourning for Shmuel, so the Holy One, Blessed is He, suspended his sentence so that it should not coincide the mourning for this wicked man with his mourning period. Afterward, he became ill for three days and died, as it is stated, "And Adonoy inflicted Novol," and a Talmudist had stated that if one was ill three days and died, it is a death of a plague. However, our Rabbis stated that these are the Ten Days of Repentance which the Holy One, Blessed is He, waited for him to repent. But, some say that they correspond to the ten meals<sup>25</sup><i class="footnote">See above verses 5,9, and Maharsha in Rosh Hashanah 18a.</i> which Novol gave Dovid's servants, for Dovid had sent him ten youths, and he fed them.

### passuk 39
