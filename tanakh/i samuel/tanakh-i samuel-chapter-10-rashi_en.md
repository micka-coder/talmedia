<b>Is hidden by the baggage.</b> In the room where newcomers had placed their baggage; [he hid] because he was running away from the high position. But the Midrash Aggadah of R. Tanchuma<sup>8</sup><i class="footnote">Vayikra 3.</i> explains that '<span>אֶל הַכֵּלִים</span>' refers to the Urim and Tumim. He said [to himself], 'perhaps I am not worthy of this high position. [I will not assume it]. until they inquire of the Urim and Tumim.<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote"> Shaul was convinced that the Urim and Tumim would confirm that he was not worthy of the kingship. But, on the contrary, it confirmed that nobody was equal to him. In Maseches Eiruvin 13b it states that he who runs away from honor is rightfully pursued by it.</i> Thereupon they asked, and he accepted it.
