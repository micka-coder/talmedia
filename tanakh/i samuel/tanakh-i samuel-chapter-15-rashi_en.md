### passuk 1
<b>Now obey Hachem's words.</b> Once you acted foolishly,<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote"> Shaul had acted improperly by not waiting for Shmuel [Above 13:8-14] as he had been instructed, therefore, Shmuel is warning him now to be careful.</i> but now be careful [in your actions].

### passuk 2

### passuk 3
<b>Oxen and sheep.</b> They were sorcerers, and they would change themselves to appear as animals.<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote"> Radak suggests another reason for destroying the animals. The Torah specifies that the memory of Amalek should be erased. Therefore, Shmuel instructed that not even an ox or a sheep should remain about which one might say ‘this animal belonged to Amalek.’</i>

### passuk 4
<b>Shaul summoned.</b> An expression of announcing [meaning the same] as in <span>.<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">Above 14:20.</i></span><span>וַיִזָּעֵק שָׁאוּל</span>
<b>And he counted them with lambs.</b> He told each one to take a lamb<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">According to Targum this occurred just before Pesach, and the lambs were Pascal sacrifices.</i> from the king's flocks, and afterwards he counted the lambs, because it is forbidden to count Jewish people.<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote"> See Maseches Yoma 22b which states that in order to avoid counting the Bnei Yisroel directly which is forbidden by the Torah, each man took a lamb from the king’s flock and the lambs were then counted. See also Kli Yokor in Bamidbar 1:2 who discusses the exceptions to this rule.</i> for it is stated concerning them, '[which] are too numerous to count.'<sup>6</sup><i class="footnote">Bereishis 32:12.</i>

### passuk 5
<b>And he fought in the valley.</b> [Meaning the same as] <span>וַיִלָּחֵם בַּנַּחַל</span> [=and he fought in the valley]. Our Rabbis said, concerning the valley, he argued and concluded, that if for the sake of one life, the Torah said to decapitate a calf in the valley,<sup>7</sup><i class="footnote">See Devarim 21:4.</i> how much more for the sake of all these lives.<sup>8</sup><i class="footnote">Shaul rationalized that he will spare the animals to use as sacrifices to atone for the Amalekites that were killed. For additional arguments presented by Shaul and their consequences, see Maseches Yoma 22b.</i> If man has sinned, what have the animals sinned?

### passuk 6
<b>To the Kenites.</b> Who were Yisro's descendants,<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote">See Shoftim 1:16.</i> who were residing in the wilderness of Yehudah, in the south of Arod, who went to Ya'aveitz to learn Torah, Arod being Amalek. The Canaanite king of Arod was Amalek, for it is stated [about him]; "who lived in the South,"<sup>10</sup><i class="footnote">Bamidbar 21:1.</i> and, "Amalek dwells in the southern part of the land."<sup>11</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid., 13:29.</i>
<b>To all the Bnei Yisroel.</b> Who partook from his [Yisro's] meal, Moshe, Aharon and all the elders of Yisroel.<sup>12</sup><i class="footnote">See Shemos 18:12.</i> It is considered as though he acted kindly with all the Bnei Yisroel.<sup>13</sup><i class="footnote">It may also refer to Yisro’s hospitality of welcoming Moshe into his home when he escaped from Paroh [Shemos 2:20-21]. Based on this event R. Nechemyah in Maseches Berachos 63b states ‘how great is the reward for one who invites a Torah scholar into his house, gives him to eat and drink, and shares his possessions with him.’ Others believe that the act of kindness with all the Bnei Yisroel refers to the good advice that Yisro gave to Moshe with regard to setting up a system of judges [Shemos 18:14-26], because this benefitted the entire nation.</i>

### passuk 9
<b>The fattened cattle.</b> This word has no likeness [in Scripture]. These are the fattened cattle;<sup>14</sup><i class="footnote">According to Mahri Kra <span>מִשֽׁנִים</span> are thoroughbred horses.</i> and I say that the expression of <span>מִשְׁנִים</span> is like <span>וְכֶסֶף מִשְׁנֶה</span> [meaning double money],<sup>15</sup><i class="footnote">Bereishis 43:12.</i> because they are doubled over with flesh and fat. Similarly, 'And the ox which was fattened [<span>הַשֵּׁנִי</span>] seven years.'<sup>16</sup><i class="footnote">Shoftim 6:25.</i>
<b>Undesirable and inferior.</b> Meaning the same as <span>נִבְזֶה</span>; and the '<span>מ</span>' is superfluous.

### passuk 10

### passuk 11
<b>I have reconsidered.</b> A thought has risen in my heart concerning Shaul's kingship, whom I have appointed king.

### passuk 12
<b>And is setting up a place for himself.</b> He is building an altar for himself. That is the altar referred to concerning Eliyohu, 'he repaired the ruined altar of Hachem.'<sup>17</sup><i class="footnote">Melachim I 18:30.</i> Targum Yonoson renders, 'and he is making room there for himself to divide the spoils.'

### passuk 15

### passuk 16
<b>Stay.</b> Like the Targum, <span>אוֹרִיךְ</span> meaning 'wait.'

### passuk 17
<b>You are the head of the tribes of Yisroel.</b> Targum Yonoson renders, 'the tribe of Binyomin crossed the [Reed] Sea ahead of all the people, as it is said, 'Binyomin, the youngest, rules them.'<sup>18</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim 68:28. You did not follow in Binyomin’s tradition of taking charge and leading the people without questioning the command of ‘<span>ה</span>. You have thus forfeited the merit by which you became king.</i>

### passuk 18
<b>Until they destroy them.</b> The people who are with you will destroy them.

### passuk 19
<b>You rushed.</b> Meaning '<span>וַתַּעַף</span>' [you flew], an expression related to '<span>עַיִט</span>' [birds of prey].<sup>19</sup><i class="footnote">Bereishis 15:11.</i>

### passuk 20

### passuk 21
<b>The best of that which was to be destroyed.</b> [<span>רֵאשִׁית</span>] meaning the best of the <span>,<sup>20</sup><i class="footnote"> Perhaps by his statement Shaul was indicating to Shmuel that they examined the animals to ascertain that none were Amalekite sorcerers who had changed themselves to appear as animals [See above verse 2].—Da’as Sofrim</i></span><span>חֵרֶם</span> and similarly, "the best of your corn,"<sup>21</sup><i class="footnote"> Devarim 18:4.</i> as it is stated, "when you set aside the finest part of it."<sup>22</sup><i class="footnote"> Bamidbar 18:30.</i> Targum Yonoson renders [<span>רֵאשִׁית</span>] 'before they banned it.'

### passuk 22
<b>Behold, obeying</b> His command is better than a choice offering.<sup>23</sup><i class="footnote">‘<span>ה</span> prefers the fulfillment of His command over the offering of voluntary sacrifices.</i>
<b>To hearken [is better] than the fat of rams.</b> This refers to, "Behold, obeying [is better] than a choice offering, and to hearken [is better] than the fat of rams."

### passuk 23
<b>For defiance is like the sin of sorcery, and stubborness is like the sin of idolatry.</b> And like the penalty for idolatry, so is the penalty for stubborness.<sup>24</sup><i class="footnote"> Shaul’s original sin was compared to sorcery, but his insisting on his innocence was compared to the more serious sin of idolatry; Shaul was compounding his original sin by insisting on his innocence.</i> Targum Yonoson renders, 'For, as the sin of a people [who divine, so is the sin of any man who disobeys the word of Hachem]<sup>25</sup><i class="footnote"> Just as one who divines demonstrates that he removes his trust in ‘<span>ה</span> and looks for other means to determine his future, so does one who disobeys and rebels against the word of ‘<span>ה</span> indicate he removes his belief in the power of ‘<span>ה</span> to reward and punish.—Radak</i> and as the sins of a nation who has strayed after idols, so is the sin of any person who adds [to the words of a prophet].
<b>Stubborness.</b> An expression adding, and similarly, "He urged [<span>וַיִפְצַר</span>] him,"<sup>26</sup><i class="footnote"> Bereishis 33:11.</i> i.e., he spoke many words to convince him.

### passuk 24
<b>I feared the people.</b> [Referring to] Do'eg, the Edomite,<sup>27</sup><i class="footnote"> He was the head of the Sanhedrin and was considered a giant in his Torah scholarship. See Maseches Sanhedrin 106b.</i> who was as important as all of them.

### passuk 25

### passuk 26

### passuk 27
<b>And he grabbed the corner of his robe.</b> According to the simple meaning, it seems that when Shmuel turned to leave Shaul, Shaul grabbed the corner of Shmuel's [robe], since Shaul was asking him to return until he would prostate himself in Gilgol, where the Tent of Meeting was. In Midrash Aggadah, however, Amora'im differ; some say that Shaul tore Shmuel's robe, and some say that Shmuel tore Shaul's robe,<sup>28</sup><i class="footnote">As a symbol of his loss of kingship. Another version is that Shmuel tore his own robe as a gesture of dismay.</i> giving over to him this sign, that whoever will tear a corner of his robe, would reign in his place. And that is what Shaul said to Dovid on the day he tore [Shaul's] robe, 'I know that you will surely reign.'<sup>29</sup><i class="footnote"> Below 24:21. See Rashi’s commentary there.</i>

### passuk 28

### passuk 29
<b>But, the Eternal One of Yisroel neither lies.</b> And if you will say, 'I will repent of my sin before Him,' it will no longer avail to take the kingship from the one to whom it was given, for the Holy One, Blessed is He, Who is the Eternal One of Yisroel, will not lie by not giving the good to whom He said to give it.

### passuk 32
<b>Agag went to him bound.</b> Targum Yonoson renders, mincingly.<sup>30</sup><i class="footnote"> Malbim renders ‘joyfully.’</i>
<b>Indeed, the bitterness of death approaches.</b> Indeed, I know that it has turned and is approaching toward me—the bitterness of death.

### passuk 33
<b>As your sword bereaved women.</b> To render them widows from their husbands, for you would cut off the membrum virile of the youths of Yisroel.<sup>31</sup><i class="footnote"> See Rashi Devarim 25:18.</i>
<b>[Shmuel] cut.</b> He cut him into four pieces. This word has no likeness [in Scripture]. The Targum renders <span>וַיְשַׁסֵּף</span> as <span>וּפָשַׁח</span>. And in our Gemara we find, 'he broke off [<span>מפשח</span>] a branch, and gave us several twigs,'<sup>32</sup><i class="footnote"> Beitzah 33b.</i> meaning that he split.<sup>33</sup><i class="footnote"> See Rashi’s commentary in Eichah 3:11.</i>
