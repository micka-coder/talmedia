And Laban arose early in the morning, kissed his sons and daughters, and blessed them; and then Laban went and returned to his place.

### passuk 2
And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.

### passuk 3
And Jacob said when he saw them: ‘This is God’s camp.’ And he called the name of that place Mahanaim.

### passuk 4
And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the field of Edom.

### passuk 5
And he commanded them, saying: ‘Thus shall ye say unto my lord Esau: Thus saith thy servant Jacob: I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now.

### passuk 6
And I have oxen, and asses and flocks, and men-servants and maid-servants; and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favour in thy sight.’

### passuk 7
And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying: ‘We came to thy brother Esau, and moreover he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.’

### passuk 8
Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed. And he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two camps.

### passuk 9
And he said: ‘If Esau come to the one camp, and smite it, then the camp which is left shall escape.’

### passuk 10
And Jacob said: ‘O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O LORD, who saidst unto me: Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will do thee good;

### passuk 11
I am not worthy of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which Thou hast shown unto Thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two camps.

### passuk 12
Deliver me, I pray Thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, lest he come and smite me, the mother with the children.

### passuk 13
And Thou saidst: I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’

### passuk 14
And he lodged there that night; and took of that which he had with him a present for Esau his brother:

### passuk 15
two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,

### passuk 16
thirty milch camels and their colts, forty kine and ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten foals.

### passuk 17
And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself; and said unto his servants: ‘Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.’

### passuk 18
And he commanded the foremost, saying: ‘When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying: Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?

### passuk 19
then thou shalt say: They are thy servant Jacob’s; it is a present sent unto my lord, even unto Esau; and, behold, he also is behind us.’

### passuk 20
And he commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying: ‘In this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him;

### passuk 21
and ye shall say: Moreover, behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us.’ For he said: ‘I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept me.’

### passuk 22
So the present passed over before him; and he himself lodged that night in the camp.

### passuk 23
And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven children, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok.

### passuk 24
And he took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had.

### passuk 25
And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.

### passuk 26
And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was strained, as he wrestled with him.

### passuk 27
And he said: ‘Let me go, for the day breaketh.’ And he said: ‘I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.’

### passuk 28
And he said unto him: ‘What is thy name?’ And he said: ‘Jacob.’

### passuk 29
And he said: ‘Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel; for thou hast striven with God and with men, and hast prevailed.’

### passuk 30
And Jacob asked him, and said: ‘Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.’ And he said: ‘Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name?’ And he blessed him there.

### passuk 31
And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: ‘for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.’

### passuk 32
And the sun rose upon him as he passed over Peniel, and he limped upon his thigh.

### passuk 33
Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sinew of the thigh-vein which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day; because he touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh, even in the sinew of the thigh-vein.
