### passuk 4
<b>“Take the filthy garments off him.”</b> Let his sons separate from their wives, and he will be forgiven.

I will also give him favor in the eyes of the king, so that he will grant [Zerubbabel’s] request for the building of the Temple and the city, as explained in Nehemiah (1:1): “The words of Nehemiah, the son of Hachaliah.” Nehemiah was identical with Zerubbabel, as we say in <i>Sanhedrin</i> (38a).

<b>Behold! I untie its knots</b> I untie its knots I thwart the plot of the enemies who wrote an accusation to stop the work.
<b>and I will remove</b> Heb. ומשתי.
<b>in one day</b> I do not know what day.
