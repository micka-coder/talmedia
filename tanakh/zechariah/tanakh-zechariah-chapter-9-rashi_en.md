### passuk 1
<b>In the land of Hadrach</b> R’ Judah the son of Ilai expounded: This is the Messiah, who is sharp against the nations and soft to Israel. R’ Yose the son of a Damascene mother said to him [to Judah the son of Ilai]: “Judah, our master, how long will you pervert the verses for us? I call heaven and earth to testify for me, that I am from Damascus, and there is a place named Hadrach. [Rabbi Yose continued:] Now how do I explain: ‘And Damascus is His resting place?’” That Jerusalem is destined to reach as far as Damascus. ‘His resting place’ means only Jerusalem, as it is said: (Psalms 132:14) “This is My resting place to eternity.” He said to him [i.e. R’ Judah to R’ Yose]: “Now how do I explain (Jer. 30: 18) ‘And the city shall be built on its mound?’” He replied: “That it is not destined to move from its place.” So was the baraitha taught in Sifre (Deut. 1:1).
<b>for man’s eye shall be to the Lord</b> For on that day man will turn to his Maker, and his eyes will see the Holy One, blessed be He, as [the prophet] states above: Let us go with you. And they and their cities will join the cities of Israel.
<b>and all the tribes of Israel</b> They are regarded by God above all the nations. Similarly, Scripture states (I Kings 11: 1): “King Solomon loved many foreign women and the daughter of Pharaoh.” Now, was the daughter of Pharaoh not included in the generalization? But the daughter of Pharaoh was as dear to him as all of them. Here, too, all the nations shall belong to the Holy One, blessed be He, and Israel is equal to all of them.

### passuk 2
<b>And also Hamath shall border thereon</b> Its border shall reach the border of Jerusalem
<b>Tyre and Sidon</b> They, too, shall be its [Jerusalem’s] villages, although it has become exceedingly wise. She [Tyre] became exceedingly wise and thought to be forever a mistress with her wisdom.

### passuk 3
<b>And Tyre built a fortification for herself</b> and [Tyre] says, “Who will bring me down to earth?”

### passuk 5
<b>Ashkelon shall see</b> the downfall of Tyre and fear.
<b>and Ekron</b> too, shall fear.
<b>for the one to whom she looked was ashamed</b> For [Ashkelon] relied on Tyre, which was the head of the sons of Esau, and Ekron, too, belonged to Edom, as our Sages said in tractate Megillah (6a): “Ekron shall be uprooted (Zeph. 2:4).” This is Caesarea, which belongs to Edom, and it originally belonged to the Philistines.

### passuk 6

### passuk 7

<b>like Jebusi</b> Jerusalem.

### passuk 8
<b>And I will encamp beside My house against a garrison</b> I will encamp beside My house to protect it from those who set up a garrison and raiders, that they should not set these up against it. A similar word is used in (Isa. 29:7) “and all those stationed around her, and those who trap her.” It is also possible to interpret מִצָבָה as מִצָבָא, with an ‘alef’ [meaning against a host].
<b>for now I have seen with My eyes</b> Now I have seen their distress with My eyes, although until now I have hidden My countenance from them.

### passuk 9
<b>Behold! Your king shall come to you</b> It is impossible to interpret this except as referring to the King Messiah, as it is stated: “and his rule shall be from sea to sea.” We do not find that Israel had such a ruler during the days of the Second Temple.

<b>and riding a donkey</b> This is a symbol of humility.
<b>and a foal of she-donkeys</b> as in (Gen. 32:16) “and ten foals.”

### passuk 13
<b>For I bend Judah for Me</b> Eventually, the Greeks will wrest the kingdom from the Persian kings and inflict harm upon you, and I will bend Judah to be a war bow for me; and Judah will wage war against the Greeks in the days of the Hasmoneans.
<b>a bow; I filled [the hand of] Ephraim</b> This is an elliptical verse: Like a bow, I filled the hand of Ephraim; as (II Kings 9:24), “And Jehu put all his strength into his bow.” Ephraim shall be as a quiver full of arrows to Me.
<b>and I will arouse your children, O Zion</b> The children of Zion on the children of Javan.

<b>like the basin</b> that is full of blood. before the altar.
<b>like the corners of the altar</b> where wine is libated. The wine would flow upon it, as we learned in tractate Sukkah (49b). This is an expression of satiety, an expression of drunkenness.

### passuk 16
<b>like the flocks of His people</b> Like the flocks that He caused to travel from Egypt to become His people.
<b>for crown stones are exalted on His land</b> For the priests, the sons of the Hasmoneans, who boast of the crown stones in the rows of the breast-plate and the ephod, will be exalted with miracles on their land.

### passuk 17

<b>Corn... young men</b> Whch gives strength to young men.
