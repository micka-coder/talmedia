<b>and the mountains were mountains of copper</b> A sign of the strength of these kingdoms, which came to them from between the two mountains, which are hard and strong, as these four chariots are messengers of the Holy one, blessed be He, to give ruling power to the four kingdoms of Babylon, Media, Greece, and Edom.

<b>and the white ones went forth after them</b> to cause Persia to mount both of them, in the north, and they ruled over Babylon.

<b>And the crowns shall be for Helem, etc.</b> This is a transposed verse. It should be understood as: And the crowns shall be in the Temple of the Lord as a good memorial for Helem and for Tobijah, who donated the silver and the gold. Those crowns were hanging in the windows in the height of the Temple, as we learned in tractate Middoth (36a, 3:8).
<b>for Helem</b> That is Heldai.
