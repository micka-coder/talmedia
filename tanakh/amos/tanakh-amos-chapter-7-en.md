Thus the Lord GOD showed me; and, behold, He formed locusts in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo, it was the latter growth after the king’s mowings.

And if it had come to pass, that when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land—so I said: O Lord GOD, forgive, I beseech Thee; How shall Jacob stand? for he is small.

### passuk 3
The LORD repented concerning this; ‘It shall not be’, saith the LORD. .

### passuk 4
Thus the Lord GOD showed me; and, behold, the Lord GOD called to contend by fire; and it devoured the great deep, and would have eaten up the land.

### passuk 5
Then said I: O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech Thee; How shall Jacob stand? for he is small.

### passuk 6
The LORD repented concerning this; ‘This also shall not be’, saith the Lord GOD.

### passuk 7
Thus He showed me; and, behold, the Lord stood beside a wall made by a plumbline, with a plumbline in His hand.

### passuk 8
And the LORD said unto me: ‘Amos, what seest thou?’ And I said: ‘A plumbline.’ Then said the Lord: Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of My people Israel; I will not again pardon them any more;

And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, And the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; And I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.

### passuk 14

### passuk 15
and the LORD took me from following the flock, and the LORD said unto me: Go, prophesy unto My people Israel.

### passuk 16

### passuk 17
Therefore thus saith the LORD: Thy wife shall be a harlot in the city, And thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, And thy land shall be divided by line; And thou thyself shalt die in an unclean land, And Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.’
