### passuk 2
<b>to the Valley of Jehoshaphat</b>—I will descend with them to the depth of justice. <b>Jehoshaphat</b>—The judgments of the Lord.

### passuk 3
<b>they cast lots</b> Heb. יִדּוּ. Like (Lam. 3:53) “And they cast (וַ יַּדּוּ) a stone upon me.”

### passuk 4
<b>Are you paying Me recompense</b>—Is this the recompense for what Solomon gave Hiram, the king of Tyre, twenty cities (I Kings 9:11)?
<b>swiftly</b> Heb. קַל מְהֵרָה, an expression of eagerness.

### passuk 5

### passuk 6

### passuk 7

### passuk 8
<b>to the Shebaites</b>—To the children of Sheba.
<b>for the Lord has spoken</b>—Now where did He speak? (Gen. 9:25) “A slave of slaves shall he be to his brothers.” So it is explained in <i>Mechilta</i> (Ex. 12:25).

### passuk 9
<b>prepare war</b>—if you can wage war against Me.

### passuk 10
<b>your plowshares</b> Heb. אִתֵּיכֶם, <i>koltres</i> in O.F:, colters.
<b>and your pruning hooks</b> Heb. וּמַזְמְרוֹתֵיכֶם, serpes in French.

### passuk 11
<b>Gather</b> Heb. עוּשׁוּ. Like חוּשוּ, hasten, so did Menahem associate it. <i>Jonathan</i>, however, renders: they shall gather, and I say that it is an expression of a block of iron (עֶשֶת), which is gathered together, masse in French, and the “tav” is not a radical.
<b>there the Lord shall break your mighty men</b> Heb. הַנְחַת. There in the gathering of the Valley of Jehoshaphat, He will break your might. So did <i>Jonathan </i>render it, but I do not know whether it is an Aramaic expression of lowering (נחת) or an expression of breaking (חתת), and the “nun” is defective. Cf. (Dan. 2:25) “brought Daniel in (הנְעַל) before the king,” which has no radical but על.

### passuk 12

<b>Stretch out a sickle etc.</b>—Draw the swords, you who go on My mission to destroy the nations.
<b>for the harvest is ripe</b>—I.e, for their time has arrived, and he compared the matter to harvest, which is harvested with sickles when it becomes completely ripe.
<b>come press for the winepress is full</b>—of grapes. Come and tread them; i.e., the measure of their iniquity is full. <b>press</b> Heb. רְדוּ, an expression of pressing [or ruling]. Cf. (Gen. 1:28) “And rule (וּרְדוּ) over the fish of the sea.”
<b>and the vats shall roar</b>—The sound of the stream of the wine going down in the vats before the winepresses is heard.

### passuk 14
<b>in the valley of decision</b>—For there it is decided that the judgment is true. And so did <i>Jonathan </i>render: the valley of judgment.

<b>a shelter</b> Heb. מַחֲסֶה, an expression of a cover, <i>abrier</i> in O.F., abri in modern French, a shelter.

### passuk 17

### passuk 18
<b>springs</b> Heb. אֲפִיקֵי, a place of the source of water.
<b>and water the valley of Shittim</b>—According to its apparent meaning, and it will water the valley of Shittim (<i>Targum</i>), and, according to its Midrashic meaning, He will atone for the iniquity of Peor.

### passuk 19
<b>Egypt etc. and Edom</b>—He juxtaposed them as regards their retribution. You find that, were it not for Egypt, Edom would not exist, as it is stated: (I Kings 11:16 21) “For Joab and all Israel remained [stationed] there for six months etc. every male in Edom.” And it is stated there: (verse 17) “Adad fled, he and some Edomite men etc. And Hadad pleased Pharaoh very much etc. And Hadad etc. that David slept with his fathers etc.” And, at the end, (verse 25) “And he was an adversary to Solomon (sic).” Said the Holy One, blessed be He: I will destroy both of them.
<b>because of the violence done to the children of Judah</b>—Because of the violence they did to the children of Judah, viz., that they shed their blood.

### passuk 21
<b>Now should I cleanse, their blood I will not cleanse</b>—Even if I cleanse them of other sins in their hands, and of the evils they have done to Me, I will not cleanse them of the blood of the children of Judah. When will this come to pass? At the time the Holy One, blessed be He, dwells in Zion.
