On the day that he [Nebuchadnezzar] is prepared to go out in the army, he polishes his iron chariots, but I do not know what פְּלָדֹת means. I say that it is a material that polishes iron well. And some interpret פְּלָדֹת as an expression of a fiery torch (לַפִּיד), by transposing the letters.
<b>and the cypresses are enwrapped</b>—<i>Jonathan</i> renders: And the heads of the [Babylonian] camps are enwrapped in colored garments.

### passuk 10
<b>Plunder silver! Plunder gold!</b>—You who come upon Nineveh.
<b>And there is no end</b>—There is no count.
<b>to the treasures</b> Heb. לְתְּכוּנָה, to their treasures. [It is called תְּכוּנָה] because the silver and gold placed in the treasury is placed there with a count, as you say (II Kings 12:12): “The counted (הַמְתֻכּן) money.” [following <i>Jonathan</i>]
<b>to sweep out [Nineveh] of all precious vessels</b> Heb. כָּבֹד, an expression of sweeping, as in (below, 3:15) “You shall be swept out (הִתְכַּבְדִי) like the nibbling locust,” an expression of sweeping the house; escovant, to sweep them out of all their precious vessels. And so did <i>Jonathan</i> render it: All precious vessels have ended. כָּבֹד is like זָכוֹר, to remember, and שָמוֹר, to observe.

### passuk 13
<b>The grown lion tore enough for his whelps</b>—As <i>Jonathan</i> renders it: The kings would bring much plunder, until there was enough for the members of their households.

<b>and he filled his caves with prey</b>—And they filled their treasuries with plunder.

### passuk 14
<b>her chariots</b>—The multiplicity of the chariots therein; <i>caraijedic</i> in O.F. -army of chariots. The additional “hey” converts the language to mean many chariots. Simliarly, there is (Ezek 24:6) “The pot in which there is filth (חֶלְאָתָה),” much filth.
<b>the voice of your ambassadors</b> Heb. מַלְאָכֵכֵה. The voice of your ambassadors, as Rabshakeh and his colleagues, the ambassadors of Assyria, had already done, “And called in a loud voice in Judean” (Isa. 36:13).
