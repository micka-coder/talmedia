<b>How can it be that the golden glow has paled.</b> This elegy was pronounced over Yoshiyahu,<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">Who was killed in a battle with Pharaoh Necho. </i> as it is stated in Divrei Hayomim, “Behold it is written in the Book of Lamentations,”<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">II Divrei Hayomim 35:25. </i> and with it he joined, in the midst of the elegy, the rest of the children of Tzion.

But the Midrash Aggadah [states that “sacred gems are spilled refers to], every fourth-part [=רְבִיעִית of blood that Yoshiyahu shed with each arrow that they thrust into him, Yirmiyahu buried in its place [i.e., where it spilled]. Concerning it he called out, “sacred gems are spilled.” 

### passuk 2
<b>Who were evaluated in golden currency.</b> Who were praised and valued like gold. Whoever saw them would say, “Look, the complexion of these is like the appearance of gold,” and similarly, “it cannot be praised תְסֻלֶּה with the gold jewelry of Ophir,”<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">Iyov 28:16. </i> [and as in,] “with jewelry of fine gold, it cannot be praised תְסֻלֶּה”<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. 28:19. </i> [and as in,] “praise סֹלּוּ Him Who rides the heavens.”<sup>6</sup><i class="footnote">Tehilim 68:5. </i> These are expressions of praise and value.

The scraps of broken metal utensils have some value, but the shards of broken earthenware have no value whatsoever. (Ramak) </i> 

### passuk 3
<b>Even the serpent.</b> Even though it is cruel, <b>it bares its breast.</b> When it sees its offspring coming from afar, hungry, it uncovers its breasts from their sheath, for it has a cover over its breasts, and it takes them out so that its offspring should not see them covered up and turn away. Then they suckle their young. 
<b>Yet the daughters of my people have become brutal.</b> They see their children crying for bread, and yet no one breaks [bread] for them; for their own lives come before their children’s lives because of the hunger.

<b>[My people’s] transgressions surpassed, etc.</b> [The severity of] their punishment<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote">Concerning S’dom, Scripture states, “her sin is extremely grave,” in Bereishis 18:20. However, concerning Yehudah, Scripture states, “The iniquity of the house of Yisroel and Yehudah is extremely extremely great,” in Yechezkeil 9:9. </i> proves about them that their transgression is greater than that of Sodom.<sup>10</sup><i class="footnote">S’dom’s sins were committed before the Torah was given and are considered accidental [חטא]. However, these sins were committed after the Torah had been given and were considered to be premeditated [עון]. (Palgei Mayim) </i> 
<b>Which was instantaneously overturned.</b> The distress of Sodom was not prolonged; it was overturned as in one moment.
<b>Untouched by [human] hands.</b> I.e., the hands of the enemy;<sup>11</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, ‘who had no prophets’ to lead them back to teshuvah; i.e., S’dom, unlike ‘my people,’ had no prophets to chastise them, therefore Bnei Yisroel’s ‘transgressions surpassed, etc.’ (Targum) </i> but it was overthrown through angels.<sup>12</sup><i class="footnote">Referring to S’dom. </i> There are also Aggadic Midrashim, but they do not fit the sequence of the verses.

<b>For they dripped with burst bellies, etc.</b> The corpses [of those who died] because of hunger were swollen from the aroma of the fruits of the field. The enemies would roast meat on the grass outside the wall, and the aroma would go into those swollen from hunger, and their stomachs would split, and their feces would ooze. This is an uglier death than those slain by the sword. 
<b>With burst bellies.</b> Being split; either by the swelling of hunger or by the stabbing of the sword is called piercing [=דְּקִירָה.
<b>From [eating] the produce of the fields.</b> Because of the roots and grass that they gathered and ate, their feces increased and they were loathsome.

### passuk 11
<b>Hachem spent His wrath.</b> Which burned in Him for many years.<sup>17</sup><i class="footnote">God’s fury is compared to a ‘consuming fire’ as in Eichah 2:3 above; also see Devorim 4:24. </i> He now spent it when He avenged Himself upon them. 

### passuk 12

### passuk 13
<b>For the sins of her false prophets.</b> [Because of the] false [prophets], this evil has befallen her.<sup>18</sup><i class="footnote">Alternately, ‘because of the sins committed against the prophets,’ namely the murder of Zecharyah, this evil has befallen her. (Eichah Rabbah 4:16) Or ‘because of the sins committed by her prophets and <i>kohanim</i> who burnt incense for idol worship, this evil has befallen her.’ (Targum) </i> 

### passuk 14

<b>In Hachem’s glaring anger He dispersed them.</b> The angry face of the Holy One, Blessed Is He, divided and separated them among the nations, because they did not respect the presence of the <i>kohanim</i> when they were in their tranquility. 

### passuk 17
<b>We persisted in longingly eyeing illusive reinforcements.</b> When the evil befell us, our eyes were still looking forward to Pharaoh’s army, concerning whom it is stated, “And the Egyptians, they help in vain and to no purpose,”<sup>23</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshayahu 30:7. </i> for they would promise us aid but they would not come, as it is stated concerning them, “Behold, Pharaoh’s army, which has come out to help [you], is returning to its land, to Egypt.”<sup>24</sup><i class="footnote">Yirmiyahu 37:7. </i> We find in Midrash Kinos that they were coming in ships. The Holy One, Blessed Is He, hinted to the sea and caused inflated flasks<sup>25</sup><i class="footnote">The text in the Midrash is שלדותיהן, i.e., their skeletons. </i> like human intestines to move about in the water. They said to each other, “These flasks are our forefathers, the men of Egypt who drowned in the sea on account of these Jews, and we are gong out to assist them?” They stopped and turned back.

<b>In their pitfalls.</b> In the pits that they dug.

### passuk 21
<b>Rejoice in gladness city of Edom.</b> Yirmiyahu prophesied about the destruction of the second Beis Hamikdosh which the Romans would destroy.<sup>29</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, it refers to Edom who rejoiced at the downfall of Yerusholayim and rejoiced at the destruction of the first Beis Hamikdosh, as it says “Remember, Hachem, for the offspring of Edom...who say ‘Destroy!
