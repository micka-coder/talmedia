### passuk 23
<b>Moshe and Aharon went [in]to, etc.</b> Why did they enter? I found in the section of Millu’im, in the added בָּרַיְיתָא to our Toras Kohanim: Why did Moshe enter with Aharon? <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>To teach him the ritual of the incense, or perhaps he entered for some other purpose? I can argue [as follows]: Descending and entering require a blessing, just as descending is similar to the [Temple] service, so entering is similar to the [Temple] service. Therefore you have learnt: Why did Moshe enter with Aharon? To teach him the ritual of the incense. Another interpretation: When Aharon saw that they offered all the sacrifices, and all the rituals had been performed, and [still] the <i>Shechinoh</i> did not descend for Israel, he was pained, and thought, “I know that God is angry with me and [it is] because of me that the Shechinoh did not descend for Israel”! He said to Moshe: “My brother Moshe, is this [what] you did to me, that I entered and was shamed”? Moshe immediately entered with him, and they begged for mercy, and the <i>Shechinoh</i> descended for Israel. 
<b>They went outside and blessed the people.</b> They said: “’May the pleasantness of Adonoy our God be upon us.’ <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>May it be [His] Will that the <i>Shechinoh</i> should rest on the work of your hands.” Because all seven days of the installation [during which time] Moshe set up the Tabernacle and served in it [as a <i>kohein</i>], and took it down every day — the <i>Shechinoh</i> did not rest on it, and Israel were ashamed, saying to Moshe: “Our master Moshe! All the trouble we went to [in order] that the <i>Shechinoh</i> should rest among us, and that we should know that we have achieved atonement for the sin of the [Golden] Calf. Therefore he said to them: “This is what Adonoy commanded you to do and the glory of Adonoy will appear to you. My brother Aharon is worthy and [even] more important that I, for by means of his sacrifices and his service the <i>Shechinoh</i> will rest among you, and you will know that the Omnipresent chose him.
