<b>Command Bnei Yisroel.</b> This is the section concerning the <i>mitzvoh</i> of the [Tabernacle] lamps. And the section in the <i>poroshoh</i> of Ve-Atoh Tetzavveh, was mentioned [there] only for the sake of the Order of the Work of the Tabernacle, to explain the purpose of the <i>menorah</i>, and so it implies: You will in the end command Bnei Yisroel regarding this. 
<b>Pure, pressed olive oil.</b> Three oils come forth from the olive: [the oil of] the first [pressing] is called “pure” — and [these three oils] are explained in [Maseches] Menochos, and <i>Toras Kohanim</i>. 
<b>Continually,</b> from night to night, like [the expression] “a continual burnt-offering,” which [comes] only from day to day. 

### passuk 3
<b>The Curtain of Testimony,</b> which is before the Ark, which is called “Testimony.” And our Rabbis expounded [this as referring] to <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the westernmost lamp, which is testimony for all the world’s inhabitants that the Divine Presence dwells in the midst of Israel. [This is because the <i>Kohen Godol</i>] places as much oil in it as for the other lamps, [but] from it he would begin [to light the lamps] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>and with it he would end. 
<b>Aharon shall arrange it [so that it burns] from evening until morning.</b> He should arrange it in a suitable arrangement according to the length of each night; the Sages estimated [this] at half a <i>log</i> for each lamp, and this was fit for even the [long] nights of the Teves season, and this measure was set for them [for the entire year]. 

### passuk 4
<b>The pure menorah,</b> [that is, the menorah] which is [made of] pure gold. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Another interpretation: [He should arrange the lamps] on the purity of the menorah, [by] first purifying it and cleaning it of its ashes. 

### passuk 5

### passuk 6
<b>Six in each stack —</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>six loaves in one stack.
<b>The pure table,</b> [that is, the table made] of pure gold. Another interpretation: [The loaves should be placed] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>on the “purity” of the table, that the supportsshould not raise the [lowest loaves of] bread <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>above the table. 

### passuk 7
<b>You shall put on [each] stack,</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>on each one of the two stacks; there were two bowls of frankincense [in all], a fistful [of frankincense] for each one [= bowl]. 
<b>And it shall be — </b>this frankincense, 
<b>as a memorial portion for the bread,</b> because of the bread itself nothing was offered to the all-Highest except that the frankincense was burnt when the bread was removed from the Table every Shabbos; and it is the memorial portion for the bread, for by means of it, it [= the bread] is remembered Above, similar to the fistful which is the memorial portion for the meal-offering. 

### passuk 8

### passuk 9
<b>It shall belong — </b>this meal-offering, for any [offering] that comes from crops is [considered in the category of] meal-offering. 
<b>And they shall eat it,</b> referring to the bread, which is a masculine [noun]. 

### passuk 10
<b>The son of an Israelite woman went out.</b> From where did he go out? R. Levi says: <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>He went out of his [everlasting] world. R. Berechiah says: From the section above he set out [to ridicule]. He mocked [the showbread], saying: “’On each and <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>every Shabbos he shall arrange them!’ It is the custom of a king to eat fresh bread every day, is it then [his way to eat] a cold loaf nine days old”? In astonishment. A teaching states: He went out guilty from Moshe’s court. He had come to pitch his tent in the midst of the tribe of Dan. They asked him: “What right have you to be here”? He said to them: “I am of the descendants of Dan.” They said to him: “Each man [shall camp] by his own flag, [that bears] the signs of their father’s house,” it is written He entered Moshe’s court and went out guilty. [whereupon] he stood up and blasphemed [= cursed]. 
<b>And he was the son of an Egyptian man —</b> he was the Egyptian <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>whom Moshe killed.
<b>Among Bnei Yisroel —</b> [this] teaches that <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>he was converted.
<b>They argued in the encampment —</b> regarding matters [concerning] the encampment.
<b>And the Israelite man —</b> the one against him, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>who protested against his pitching his tent. 

### passuk 11
<b>Clearly pronounced,</b> as its Targum: “and he pronounced,” that he clearly pronounced the Proper Name, and blasphemed — it [the Name he used] is the Explicit Name he heard at Sinai. 
<b>The name of his mother was Shelomis, daughter of Divri.</b> It is to the credit of Israel that this verse publicized this one, to say that <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>she alone was a wayward woman. 
<b>Shlomis.</b> [She was called this] because she would chatter, “Be well”! “Be well” “Be well”! babbling [many] words, asking [about] everyone’s health. 
<b>Daughter of Divri.</b> She was a chatterer, speaking with every person [who came her way], and therefore she became corrupted. 
<b>Of the tribe of Dan.</b> [This] tells that an evil person causes disgrace to himself, disgrace to his father, disgrace to his tribe. Similarly, “Oholiov son of Achisomoch, of the tribe of Dan” — a credit to him, a credit to his father, a credit to his tribe. 

### passuk 12
<b>They placed him [in the guardhouse] —</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>by himself, and they did not place the wood-gatherer with him, though the two of them were [in custody] during the same period of time. They knew <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>that one who gathered wood [on Shabbos] was [condemned] to death, as it is said, “anyone who profanes it shall be put to death,” but <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the execution itself had not been explained to them. Therefore it is said, “For it had not been explained [to them] what should be done to him.” But regarding the blasphemer [the verse] says: “to explain to them” — for they did not know if he was liable to death or not. 

### passuk 13

### passuk 14
<b>Those who heard him. —</b> These are the witnesses.
<b>All — </b>[this comes] to includes the judges.
<b>Their hands.</b> They say to him: “Your blood is on your head, and we are not punished for your death, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>for you caused [it] to yourself. 
<b>The entire congregation,</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>in the presence of the entire congregation. (From here) we learn that a man’s agent is like the man himself. 

### passuk 15
<b>Shall bear [the burden] of his sin — </b> with <i>koreis</i>, when there is no warning. 

### passuk 16
<b>Whoever pronounces clearly —</b> he is not guilty until he pronounces the Name clearly, and not one who blasphemes by one of [God’s] titles. 
<b>And whoever pronounces.</b> “Pronounces” here is an expression of “cursing,” as [in the verse] “Why should I curse”? 

### passuk 17
<b>Any man who kills.</b> Since it is said, “If one strikes a man and [the victim dies]” I [know that this applies] only when he killed a man, from where [do I know] [if he killed] a woman or minor? The verse [here] says: “any human being.” 

### passuk 18

### passuk 19

### passuk 20
<b>So shall it be done to him.</b> Our Rabbis explained that [this] does not [mean] placing an actual blemish [on him], but [rather] the payment of money. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>We appraise [his worth] as a slave [being sold in a slave-market]. Therefore [יִנָתֵן,] “giving” is written regarding it — something which is given from hand to hand. 

### passuk 21
<b>Whoever smites an animal shall pay for it,</b> above (verse 18), [it] spoke of one who kills an animal, and here it speaks of one <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>who causes a wound to it. 
<b>Whoever smites a person shall be put to death,</b> even if he did not kill him, but [merely] caused a wound, for here [the word] “soul” does not appear. And of one who smites <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>his father or his mother. [this] verse speaks, and [this verse is placed here] to compare [this case] to one who smites an animal: Just as one who smites an animal [when it is] alive [is liable], so [too] one who smites his father [when he is] alive [is liable] — excluding one who smites [his father or mother] after [their] death. Since we find that one who curses [one’s father and mother even] after death, is liable to the death[-penalty], it was necessary to state [the law] regarding one who smites [a parent’s body after death] that he is exempt [from the death penalty]. [The comparison goes the other way as well:] Just as [for wounding] an animal, [one must pay compensation], [for] if there is no wound there is no payment, so [too] one who strikes his father is not liable [to the death-penalty] until he causes a wound to him. 

### passuk 22
<b>For I am Hachem, your God,</b> the God of all of you; just as I attach My Name to you, so I attach it to converts. 

### passuk 23
<b>And Bnei Yisroel did — </b> [they carried out] the complete <i>mitzvoh</i> of stoning mentioned elsewhere [on the blasphemer]: casting [the condemned man down from a height], the heaping of stones [on him], and hanging [his body afterwards].
