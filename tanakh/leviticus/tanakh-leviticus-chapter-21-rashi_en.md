### passuk 1
<b>Speak to the kohanim.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Say, and you shall say — to warn the adults regarding the minors. 
<b>The sons of Aharon.</b> Perhaps those unfit [are also included in this prohibition]? <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The verse says:
<b>The kohanim. The sons of Aharon —</b> even those who have a [physical] blemish are implied.
<b>The sons of Aharon,</b> and not the daughters of Aharon. 
<b>Let him not defile himself among his people,</b> while the dead body is still <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>“among his people,” <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>excluding a <i>mes mitzvoh</i>. 

### passuk 2
<b>Except for his kin.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>“His kin” [refers] to none other than his wife.

### passuk 3
<b>To whom he is closely related —</b> to include <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the betrothed [sister].
<b>Who has not yet been married,</b> [referring to the marriage’s] consummation. 
<b>For her, he may be defiled.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>[It is] a [positive] command. 

### passuk 4
<b>A husband may not defile himself among his people to become profaned.</b> He may not defile himself for an illegitimate wife, through whom he becomes unfit [for the <i>kehunoh</i>], while she is still with him. And thus the plain meaning of the verse is [as follows]: “A husband may not defile himself” — “with his flesh,” while [the corpse is] yet “among his people” — when there are [people available who can] bury her, [that is,] she is not a <i>mes mitzvoh</i>. And regarding what flesh [= wife] did I speak?<i></i> Regarding one [through] which “he becomes profaned” — to become unfit from his <i>kehunoh</i>. 

### passuk 5
<b>They shall not make baldness</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>for a deceased person. Were not Israelites also prohibited such [conduct]? However, because it was stated regarding Israelites: “[You shall not make any baldness] ’between your eyes’ [for the dead],” Perhaps he is not liable [for plucking out hair] on [any part] of the head [other than “between the eyes”]? The verse says: “on their head” — and [the law of] Israelites is derived from [the law] of <i>kohanim</i> by [means of] a <i>gezeroh shovoh</i>: “baldness” (קָרְחָה) is mentioned here and “baldness’ (קָרְחָה) is mentioned regarding Israelites — just as here [any part of] the entire head [is implied], <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>so too further on the entire head is implied, wherever he makes a bald spot on the head. And just as further on [the prohibition involves mourning] for a deceased person, so, here [mourning] for a deceased person [is implied]. 
<b>And the corners of their beards they shall not shave.</b> Because regarding an Israelite it is said, “you shall not destroy [by shaving the corner of your beard],” <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>perhaps for plucking with a tweezer or with plane-like tools he is liable? Therefore it is said, “they shall not shave” — he is liable only for something which is called “shaving” and which has in it “destructiveness,” and that [is accomplished only with] a razor. 
<b>They shall not make gashes in their flesh.</b> Because it is said regarding an [ordinary] Israelite, “A gash for the dead shall you not make,” perhaps [this means that if he] made five gashes, he is liable for only one? The verse says: “They shall not make gashes” — <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>to make him liable for each and every gash. for this word [= “gashes”] is superfluous [and intended] for midrashic exposition, for it should have been written: “They shall not gash,” and I would know that [the verb “gash” refers to] gashes. 

### passuk 6
<b>They shall be holy.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The court shall sanctify them against their will in this.

### passuk 7
<b>A harlot,</b> [A woman] who has had sexual relations with an Israelite who is forbidden for her to marry, under the penalty of <i>koreis</i> [for doing so], or a נָתִין, or a מַמְזֵר . 
<b>A profaned woman,</b> [that is, a woman] who was born of a marriage [between a <i>Kohen</i>] and one [forbidden] to the <i>kehunoh</i>, as for example the daughter of a widow [illegally married] to a <i>Kohen Godol</i>, or the daughter of a divorced woman [illegally married] to an ordinary <i>Kohen</i>. So too one who became invalid [for intermarriage] with the <i>kehunoh</i> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>because she had sexual relations in one of the marriages forbidden to a <i>Kohen</i>. 

### passuk 8
<b>You shall make him holy —</b> [even] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>against his will, for if he does not wish to divorce [his illegal wife], beat him and punish him until he does divorce [her]. 
<b>He shall be holy unto you,</b> treat him with sanctity, to take precedence in all matters [of sanctity], and to bless first at a meal. 

### passuk 9
<b>Who profanes herself by fornication,</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>when she becomes profaned through fornication, as when she had [some] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>marital tie with a husband and fornicated, whether [this tie was through] betrothal or marriage. Our Rabbis disagreed about the matter, [but] all agree that the verse does not speak regarding a free woman. 
<b>She profanes her father.</b> She has profaned and degraded his honor, for they say of him: “Cursed be he that he caused this one to be born; cursed be he that he raised this one”! 

### passuk 10
<b>Shall not let [his hair] grow wild,</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>it shall not grow wild in mourning. And what is [the measure] of “growing wild”? More than thirty days. 

### passuk 11
<b>And adjacent to any dead body, etc.</b> [That is,] in[to] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>a tent [which is over a] dead body. 
<b>Dead body </b>[literally, “souls of a dead body”] — to include <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>a quarter [of a לוֹג] of blood from a dead body, which causes impurity in a “tent.” 
<b>For his father and his mother he shall not become [ritually] impure.</b> This comes only <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>to permit him [to become impure] for a <i>mes mitzvoh</i>.

### passuk 12
<b>He shall not depart from the Sanctuary.</b> He does not follow the coffin. Furthermore, our Rabbis learned from here that a <i>Kohen Godol</i> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>may offer [a sacrifice] while he is an <i>onein</i>, and this is its meaning: Even if his father and his mother died, he is not required to leave the Sanctuary, but performs the Temple-service. 
<b>And he shall not profane. . .the Sanctuary,</b> He does not profane the Temple-service with this, since Scripture permitted him [to remain there]; thus, [we learn,] that an ordinary <i>Kohen</i> who performs [the Temple-service] while he is an <i>onein</i> <i>does</i> profane [it]. 

### passuk 13

### passuk 14
<b>And a profaned woman,</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>born of [a marriage] forbidden to the <i>kehunoh</i>. 

### passuk 15
<b>He shall not profane his offspring —</b> thus, if he marries one [of those] women invalid [for marriage with <i>kohanim</i>], his offspring from her is <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>profaned from the status of the holiness of the <i>kehunoh</i>. 

### passuk 16

### passuk 17
<b>The bread of his God,</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>“the food” of his God. Every meal is called “food,” as [in the verse] “he made a great feast.” 

### passuk 18
<b>For any man who has a blemish shall not approach.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>It is not proper that he approach; [the word “approach”] is like [that in the verse] “[If you offer the lame or sick, is it not evil?] Offer it now to your governor; [will he be pleased with you?].” 
<b>A man with a sunken nose,</b> [one] whose nose is sunken between the two eyes, [so that] he can paint <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>both his eyes with one stroke. 
<b>A man who has disproportionate limbs,</b> [one who has] one limb larger than the other — one eye large and one eye small, or one thigh is <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>longer than the other. 

### passuk 19

### passuk 20
<b>One with overhanging eyebrows.</b> <i>Sorzilos</i> in Old French, [denoting one whose] eyebrows — their hair is long and lies [over his face]. 
<b>Or with a cataract,</b> who has a membrane in his eyes, which is called <i>toyle</i> [in Old French], similar [to the use of the word in the verse]: “Who spreads out [the heavens] like a membrane.” 
<b>Or a disarrangement [in the eye],</b> something which confuses the eye, such as a white streak which stretches from the white [of the eye] and intersects the iris — the circle which surrounds the black [of the eye], [that] which is called <i>prunelle</i> in Old French. This streak intersects the circle and enters the black [of the eye]. The Targum of תְּבַלוּל is חִילִּיז, a word [related to] חִלָּזוֹן, for that streak is similar to a worm, and so the Sages of Israel termed it, [when describing] the blemishes [which can befall] a firstling: worm, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>snake, wart. 
<b>Scurf [= gorov] or scabs [= yallefes].</b> These are types of boils. “Scurf” is [what is called elsewhere] <i>cheres</i>, a boil [which is] dry within and without [on the surface]; “scab” is the Egyptian lichen. And why is it called <i>yallefes</i>? Because it continues to cling [to the body] until the day of death, and it is moist without and dry within, and in another place <i>gorov</i> is called <i>shechin</i> — moist without and dry within, as it is said, “and with the scab [= <i>gorov</i>] and with the itch [= <i>cheres</i>].” When [the word] “scurf” [= <i>gorov</i>] [appears] near <i>cheres</i>, [then] “scab” [= <i>yallefes</i>] is called “scurf” [= <i>gorov</i>], [but] when it [= <i>gorov</i>] [appears] near “scab” [= <i>yallefes</i>], <i>cheres</i> is called “scurf” [= <i>gorov</i>] — so is it explained in Bechoros. 
<b>Or one with crushed testicles,</b> [which is,] according to the Targum: <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i> מְרֵס פַּחֲדִין, whose פַּחֲדִין are מְרוּסָסִין — his testicles are crushed. [The word] פַּחֲדִין is related [to its meaning in the verse]: “All the sinews of his testicles are knit together.” 

### passuk 21
<b>Any man who has a blemish —</b> [this comes] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>to include other blemishes.
<b>He has a blemish,</b> while “he has a blemish,” he is unfit; therefore, if the blemish passes, he is fit. 
<b>The bread of his God,</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>every food is called “bread.” 

### passuk 22
<b>Of the most holy [sacrifices] —</b> these are the most holy sacrifices.
<b>And from the holy, he may eat.</b> These are the sacrifices of lesser sanctity. If sacrifices of greater sanctity are mentioned, why are sacrifices of lesser sanctity [also] mentioned? If it had not been said, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>I would have thought: A blemished person may eat of the most holy sacrifices, since we find that they were permitted to a non-<i>Kohen</i>, [as when] Moshe ate the flesh of the installation-sacrifices. But [I might think] that of the breast and thigh of sacrifices of lesser sanctity he may not eat, since we do not find that a non-<i>Kohen</i> had a part in them — therefore sacrifices of lesser sanctity are mentioned. So is it explained in [the Maseches of] Zevochim. 

### passuk 23
<b>However, [he may not enter] beyond the curtain,</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>to sprinkle seven sprinklings on the curtain. 
<b>And to the altar,</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the outer [one]. And both [the curtain and the altar] had to be written, and [the reason] is explained in Toras Kohanim. 
<b>He shall not profane My holy things.</b> For if he did perform [the service], <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>his service is profaned and becomes invalid. 

### passuk 24
<b>Moshe spoke</b> this <i>mitzvah</i>.
<b>To Aharon and to his sons and to all of Bnei Yisroel —</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>to warn the court regarding the <i>kohanim</i>.
