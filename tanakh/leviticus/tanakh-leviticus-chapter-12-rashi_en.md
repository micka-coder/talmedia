<b>When a woman conceives.</b> R. Simlai said: Just as the creation of mankind [came only] after [that of] every animal, beast and bird <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>in the Work of Creation, so too his teaching is explained [only] after the teaching [regarding] animals, beasts and birds. 
<b>When [she] conceives.</b> [This comes] to include even [when the embryo] is born <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>mushy — [that is, as though] it was crushed and became <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>as semen — its mother [is ritually] unclean as if it were childbirth. 
<b>As the days of her menstrual flow shall she be unclean.</b> According to the order of all impurity <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>mentioned in regard to a menstruant woman, so is she made impure by the impurity of childbirth — even if the womb opens without [any visible] blood. 
<b>Flow,</b> an expression of something <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>which flows from her body. Another interpretation: An expression of illness and malady, for a woman does not see blood without becoming ill, and her head and limbs [feel] heavy.

<b>She will remain.</b> תֵּשֵׁב is nothing more than an expression of “remaining” as [for example] “You remained in Kadesh,” “He settled in the Plains of Mamrei.” 
<b>that the blood is ritually pure,</b> [implying] that <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>even if she sees [blood], she is [ritually] pure. 
<b>that the blood is ritually pure,</b> without a מַפִּיק הֵא, and [so this word] is a noun, equivalent to טהַר . 
<b>The days of her purity.</b> [The word טָהֳרָהּ has a] מַפִּיק הֵא, [meaning:] “the days of <i>her</i> purity.” 
<b>She shall not touch.</b> A warning <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>to one who eats, etc. as it was taught in [Maseches] Yevomos. 
<b>Anything holy.</b> [The word “anything” comes] to include <i>terumoh</i>, for this one is [considered] as <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>one who has immersed [in a מִקְוֶה, but whose purification is concluded only] after a long day. [That is,] she immersed at the end of seven [days], but her “sun” of purification does not set until sunset of the fortieth day; then she brings her purification atonement the next day.

<b>He will bring it.</b> This teaches you that [the omission of] only <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>one of them prevents her from eating holy food, and what is that? That is the sin-offering, as it is said, “and the <i>kohein</i> will atone for her and she will be cleansed” — [the one] which comes to atone — [it is] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>on it that the purification depends. 
<b>And she will be cleansed.</b> Therefore, [we learn] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>that until now she is considered unclean. 

### passuk 8
<b>One as a burnt-offering and one as a sin-offering.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The verse placed it first only for [the purpose of] reading [the Torah scroll], but as to [the order of] offering [the sacrifices], the sin-offering precedes the burnt-offering; so have we learned in [Maseches] Zevochim, in the chapter “Kol Hatodir.”
