<b>Any commandment of Adonoy. </b>Our Rabbis explained: A sin-offering comes only for something whose intentional violation [involves] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>a negative commandment and [the penalty] of <i>kareis.</i>
<b>One of these,</b> part of one of them, such as one who writes on Shabbos, Shem of Shimon, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Noach of Nochor, Don of Doniel. 

### passuk 3
<b>If the anointed kohein should sin to bring guilt on the people,</b> Its midrashic interpretation: He is not obliged [to bring a sin-offering] unless there is a hidden thing together <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>with an unintentional [illegal] act, as it is said, “to bring guilt on the people” “and something is hidden from the congregation and they do.” And its plain meaning according to the <i>aggodoh</i>: When the <i>kohein godol</i> sins, it [results] in the guilt of the people, for they are dependent on him to atone for them and pray for them — and [now] he has become impaired. 
<b>Bullock</b> [literally, “a bullock, son of cattle.”] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Perhaps an old one? The verse says: “son.” If a son, perhaps a young one? The verse says: “a bullock.” How is this? This [refers to] a three-year old bullock.

<b>The Tent of Meeting, </b>to the Tabernacle, and in the Temple, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>to the <i>Heichal.</i> 

### passuk 6
<b>In front of the Holy Curtain, </b>before its most holy spot, exactly <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>in front of the space between the poles. The blood [need] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>not touch the holy curtain, but if [by accident] they touched, they touched. 

### passuk 7
<b>And all the blood,</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the remaining blood. 

### passuk 8
<b>And all the fat of the bullock [of the sin-offering].</b> [The verse] should have stated “its fat.” Why does the verse state “[the fat] of the bullock”? To include <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the bullock [offered] on Yom Kippur [under the rule regarding] the kidneys, the fats and the lobe [on the liver]. 
<b>The sin-offering,</b> to include <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the goats [brought as a sin-offering] for idolatry [under the rule regarding] the kidneys, the fats and the lobe [on the liver]. 
<b>He shall separate from it, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i></b>from that which is still attached — [to teach us] that he should not butcher it before the removal of the fat. (Toras Kohanim) 

### passuk 9

### passuk 10
<b>In the same manner as they were separated,</b> from those fats [for burning] explained regarding an ox [offered] for a peace-offering. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>But what was explained in regard to a peace-offering that was not explained here? Rather, to compare this to a peace-offering. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Just as peace-offerings [must be offered] for their own sake, so this [must be offered] for its own sake; and just as peace-offering [bring] peace to the world, so this [brings] peace to the world. And [it is taught] <i>Shechitas Kodoshim,</i> [that the verse] is required to derive from it [the rule] that we may not derive a <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>law from a law [which itslf was derived from scripture] regarding Holy Things [= sacrifices] — in the Chapter Ezehu Mekoman [= Zevochim, 49b]. 
<b>On the liver, on the kidneys, with its head, and feet</b> — all of them [= all the “on’s” mentioned in these verses] are expressions of “addition,” as [the word] “besides.” 

### passuk 11

### passuk 12
<b>To a pure [undefiled] place.</b> Since there is outside the city a place prepared for impurity — [in which] to throw out stones stricken with plague, and [set aside] for a cemetery — it was necessary to state that “beyond the encampment,” which is outside the city [= Jerusalem], that the place should be pure. 
<b>Beyond the encampment, </b><i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>beyond the three encampments, and in the Temple, [this means] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>outside the city [of Jerusalem], as our Rabbis explained it in Maseches Yomo and in Sanhedrin. 
<b>Where the ashes are thrown,</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>a place in which they spill the ashes removed from the altar, as it is said, “He shall take the ashes out beyond the encampment [to a pure place].” 
<b>It shall be burned where the ashes are thrown.</b> Though the verse did not have to say [this] except to teach that [the bullock is burnt] even if <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>there are no ashes there.

### passuk 13
<b>Congregation of Yisroel, </b>this [refers to] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the <i>sanhedrin</i>. 
<b>The matter [that error] was concealed,</b> they erred in a decision regarding an [act which leads to a punishment of] <i>kerisos</i> [mentioned] in the Torah — [ruling] that it is permitted. 
<b>The community and they did,</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>that the community acted according to their decision.

### passuk 17
<b>In front of the curtain. </b>[But] above it says: “In front of the <i>Holy</i> Curtain.” [Why the change in terminology?] It may be compared to a king against whom a province rebelled; if the smaller portion of it rebelled, his court continues to exist. But if all of it rebelled, his court does not continue to exist. So too here. When the anointed <i>kohein</i> [= the <i>kohein godol</i>] sinned, there is still the designation of sanctity on the Temple; when all of them sin, God forbid, the holiness is removed. 

### passuk 18
<b>The base of the altar of the burnt-offering which is at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.</b> This [refers] to the western base which is <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>opposite “the entrance [of the Tent of Meeting or Sanctuary].”

### passuk 19
<b>He shall remove all its fat. </b>Even though the lobe and two kidneys are not specified here, they learn this from “he shall do to the bullock as he did [to the sin-offering].” Why was this not explained here? It was taught in the School of R. Yishmo’el: This may be compared to a king who became angry with his friend, [but] minimized his sin because of his love for him. 

### passuk 20
<b>He shall do to</b> — <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>this — <b>bullock as he did to the sin-offering bullock</b>, as explained in regard to the bullock of the anointed <i>kohein</i> [= the <i>kohein godol</i>] — to include <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the lobe and two kidneys — for he explained there what he didn’t explain here, and to repeat the <i>mitzvos</i> of the [Temple] services, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>to teach that if he omitted one of all the applications [of blood], it is invalid. Because we have found [elsewhere] that [if blood] which had to be placed on the outer altar that if he placed it <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>with only one application — he has [nevertheless effected] the atonement, it was necessary to say here, that [the omission of] any one of these impedes [the atonement]. 

### passuk 21

### passuk 22
<b>If a leader sins.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>An expression of “fortunate is. . .” Fortunate is the generation whose leader is concerned to bring an atonement for his inadvertent transgression — all the more so that he regrets his intentional transgressions.

### passuk 23
<b>Or [if his sin] becomes known [to him],</b> similar to “<i>if</i> the matter becomes known. There are many “or’s” which serve [the same purpose] as the expression “if,” and “if” in place of “or.” Similarly, “<i>or</i> [= if] it became known that the ox is a gorer.” 
<b>It becomes known to him.</b> When he sinned he thought that it was permitted, and afterwards he became aware that it was forbidden. 

### passuk 24
<b>In the place where the burnt-offering is slaughtered,</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>in the north [of the altar], which is explained in regard to the burnt-offering. 
<b>It is a sin-offering,</b> [when it is offered for] its sake, it is valid; when <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>not for its sake, it is invalid. 

### passuk 25
<b>And its blood — <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i></b>the remnants of its blood.

### passuk 26
<b>As the fat of a peace-offering,</b> as those fats [burnt on the altar] which are detailed regarding <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>a goat which is discussed [in the section dealing with] the peace-offering.

### passuk 33
<b>And slaughter it as a sin-offering,</b> that its slaughter should be for the sake of a sin-offering. 

### passuk 34

### passuk 35
<b>As the fat of the lamb was removed,</b> whose fats [burnt on the altar] were increased by [the addition] of the fat tail, so too the sin-offering, when it comes [as a] lamb, requires [that] the fat tail [be burnt] with fats. 
<b>On the fires of Adonoy,</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>on the fires which are made for God [by human effort], <i> foailles</i> in Old French.
