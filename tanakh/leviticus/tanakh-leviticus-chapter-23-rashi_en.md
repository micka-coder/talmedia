### passuk 2
<b>Speak to Bnei Yisroel, [and say to them], the appointed times.</b> Regulate the appointed times so that [the] Israel[ites] should become practiced in them. [We learn from this] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>that [the Sanhedrin] proclaims a leap year for those living in the Exile who have left their homes to ascend [to Jerusalem] for the festival, [but] have not yet reached Jerusalem. 

### passuk 3
<b>Six days.</b> What is the connection between Shabbos and the festivals? To teach you that whoever profanes the festivals is considered as though he profaned the <i>Shabbasos</i>, and whoever keeps the festivals is considered as though he kept the <i>Shabbasos</i>. 

### passuk 4
<b>These are the appointed times of Adonoy.</b> Above [the verse] speaks of proclaiming a leap year, and here it speaks of <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>sanctification of the month. 

### passuk 5
<b>In the afternoon,</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>from six hours onward. 
<b>A Pesach (offering) for Adonoy,</b> [referring] to bringing <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the sacrifice whose name is Pesach. 

### passuk 6

### passuk 7

### passuk 8
<b>You shall bring a fire-offering, etc.</b> These are the additional sacrifices which are mentioned in Parshas Pinchos. And why are they mentioned here? To say that the[se] additional sacrifices do not impede one another, [since it states]: 
<b>You shall bring a fire-offering to Adonoy,</b> [bring it] under any circumstance if there are no oxen [available], bring rams, and if there are no oxen or rams, bring lambs. 
<b>[On each of] seven days.</b> Wherever שִׁבְעַת, (“seven”) is said, it is a noun — a week of days, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i><i>seteyne</i> in Old French, and so too every expression of “eight of,” “six of.” “five of,” “three of.” 
<b>You shall not do any work of labor.</b> Even that work which is considered as necessary labor, which cause[s] monetary loss by its neglect, such as an opportunity which is lost. So have I understood from Toras Kohanim, which teaches: <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>“Perhaps even [during] the intermediate days of the festival the work of labor should be forbidden? Etc. 

### passuk 9

### passuk 10
<b>First fruits of your harvest —</b> that it should be <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the first of the harvest.
<b>An <i>omer</i>, </b>a tenth of an <i>ephoh</i> — <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>such was its name, as: “[when] they measured [it] by the <i>omer</i>.” 

### passuk 11
<b>He shall wave.</b> Every waving [denotes that] he moves [it] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>horizontally away from him and toward him, vertically upwards and downwards; horizontally away from him and toward him — to prevent destructive winds, [and] vertically upwards and downwards — <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>to prevent harmful dews. 
<b>Be favorably accepted for you.</b> If you bring [it] according to this rule, it will be favorably accepted for you. 
<b>On the day after the day of rest,</b> the day after the first festival day of Pesach, for if you say that [this refers] to <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the Shabbos of Creation, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>you [cannot] know which [Shabbos] is meant. 

### passuk 12
<b>You shall prepare. . .a lamb,</b> [which] comes as <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>an obligation in connection with the <i>omer</i> [meal-offering]. 

### passuk 13
<b>Its meal-offering,</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the meal-offering [which accompanies] its wine-offering. 
<b>Two tenths — </b>it was double.
<b>Its wine-offering is one fourth of a <i>hin</i>.</b> Even though its meal-offering was double, its wine-offering was not double. 

### passuk 14
<b>Parched grain,</b> flour made from tender grain, which is dried in an oven. 
<b>Tender grain,</b> those are the parched grains, which are called <i>greneds</i> [in Old French]. 
<b>In all your dwelling places.</b> The Sages of Israel disagreed about this. Some learned from this that [the prohibition] of חָדָשׁ applies outside the land [of Israel], and some say that this comes only to teach [us] that we were not commanded regarding חָדָשׁ until after taking possession and settling [the land], after conquering and dividing [it among the tribes]. 

### passuk 15
<b>From the day after the day of rest,</b> the day after the festival. 
<b>Seven complete weeks shall they be.</b> [This] teaches that one should begin [to] count at night, for if not so, they [= the seven weeks] are not complete. 

### passuk 16
<b>The seventh week,</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>as its Targum: “the seventh week.” 
<b>Until the day after the seventh week, you shall count [fifty days].</b> But not including [the day] until which you count — and those are the forty-nine days [referred to]. 
<b>Fifty days, and you shall bring a new meal-offering for Adonoy.</b> Bring it <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>on the fiftieth day. I say this is its Midrash, but its plain meaning is: “Until the day after the seventh week — which is the fiftieth day — you should count” [and then bring the offering]. [This] is an inverted verse. 
<b>A new meal-offering.</b> “That is the first meal-offering which is brought from <i>chodosh</i>, and if you say: “But the <i>omer</i> meal-offering has [already] been brought”! [The <i>omer</i> meal-offering] is not like other meal-offerings, for it comes from <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>barley. 

### passuk 17
<b>From your dwelling places — </b>and not from outside the land [of Israel].
<b>Bread wave-offering,</b> the bread [to be] raised, which is raised [= offered] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>for the Most High, and this is the “new meal-offering” mentioned above. 
<b>First fruit-offering,</b> first of all the meal-offerings — even of the “jealousy” meal-offering which comes from barley, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>may not be brought from <i>chodosh</i> before the “two breads.” 

### passuk 18
<b>Along with the bread,</b> for the sake of the bread, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>an obligation of the bread. 
<b>With their meal-offerings and wine-offerings,</b> according to the rule of meal-offerings and wine-offerings explained regarding every animal [sacrifice] in the <i>poroshoh</i> of wine-offerings: three tenths for each ox and two tenths for each ram, and a tenth for each lamb — this is the meal-offering. [As for] the wine-offerings: half a <i>hin</i> for each ox, a third of a <i>hin</i> for each ram, and a fourth of a <i>hin</i> for each lamb. 

### passuk 19
<b>You shall prepare one he-goat.</b> Perhaps the seven lambs and the he-goat mentioned here are identical with the seven lambs and he-goat mentioned in חוּמַּשׁ הַפְּקוּדִים ? When you reach the [listing] of oxen and rams, [you see] that it is not so. You must conclude from this [that] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>these are [a group] unto themselves and these are [a group] unto themselves. These are brought for the sake of the bread, and these are for the additional sacrifices. 

### passuk 20
<b>The kohein shall wave them, a wave-offering.</b> [This] teaches that they require waving <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>[while] alive. Perhaps all of them? The verse says: “with the two lambs.” 
<b>They shall be holy.</b> Because peace-offerings brought by an individual [are classified] as holy things of a lesser degree, it was necessary to state of communal peace-offerings, that they are <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>holy things of a greater degree. 

### passuk 21

### passuk 22
<b>When you reap.</b> [The verse] repeats [the prohibition] so that a transgressor violates two prohibitions. Said R. Avdimi son of R. Yosef: Why did Scripture place it [= this agricultural prohibition] in the midst of the festival [laws], Pesach and Shevu’os on one side, Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, and Sukkos on the other? [In order] to teach you that whoever gives gleanings, the forgotten sheaf and the corner of the field to the poor person [in a] proper [manner], is considered as though he built the Temple and brought his sacrifices within it. 
<b>You shall leave,</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>leave [it] before them and they will gather [it], and you must not help any one of them [in preference to anyone else]. 
<b>I am Adonoy, your God,</b> faithful to give a reward. 

### passuk 23

### passuk 24
<b>A remembrance of the sounding [of the shofor].</b> A mention of Biblical verses [which relate] to [Divine] Remembrances and Biblical verses [which relate to the] <i>shofor</i> — <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>to remember for your sake the binding of Yitzchok for whom a ram was brought in his stead.

### passuk 25
<b>You shall bring a fire-offering,</b> the additional offerings mentioned in חוּמַשׁ הַפְּקוּדִים . 

### passuk 26

### passuk 27
<b>Indeed.</b> Every time “however” and “indeed (except),” [are mentioned] in the Torah [they represent] a limitation. [Here, the limitation is this:] [Yom Kippur] atones for those who repent, but does not atone for those who do not repent. 

### passuk 28

### passuk 29

### passuk 30
<b>I will cause [that person] to perish.</b> Because [the verse] says “cutting off” everywhere [else], and I do not know what that is, [here] when it says, “I will cause [that person] to perish” it teaches that <i>koreis</i> is nothing other than destruction. 

### passuk 31
<b>Any work, etc.</b> [This is repeated to teach that one who does work on Yom Kippur] transgresses many prohibitions, or to [teach that] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>work at night is prohibited, just as working during the day [is prohibited]. 

### passuk 32

### passuk 33

### passuk 34

### passuk 35
<b>A holy assembly.</b> Sanctify it with fine clothing and with prayer, and in regard to other festivals, [sanctify them] with food, drink, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>fine clothing and prayer. 

### passuk 36
<b>It is [a day] of convocation.</b> I have kept you with me, like a king who invited his children for a feast for a certain number of days, when the time came for them to leave, he said: “My children, I beg of you, remain with me one more day; your leaving is difficult for me.” 
<b>Any work of labor,</b> even work which is labor for yourselves, that if you do not do it, there will be a loss [to you] in the matter — 
<b>You shall not do.</b> Perhaps [this applies to] the intermediate days of the festival, that [all] work or labor should be forbidden? The verse says: “It [is a day of convocation].” 

### passuk 37
<b>A burnt-offering and a meal-offering,</b> a meal-offering [which accompanies] the wine-offering which is brought <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>with the burnt-offering. 
<b>Each on its assigned day,</b> a quantity fixed <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>in Chumash Hapekudim. 
<b>Each on its assigned day —</b> therefore, if the day has passed, the sacrifice is cancelled. 

### passuk 38

### passuk 39
<b>Indeed, on the fifteenth day, you shall celebrate —</b> [bringing] a peace-offering [as] sacrifice for the pilgrim’s sacrifice. Perhaps this [sacrifice] supersedes Shabbos? The verse says: “However,” [which is a limitation]; since it has [a supplementary period] for repayment all seven [days of the festival]. 
<b>When you gather the produce of the land —</b> that this seventh month should come at the time of harvest. From here [we learn] that they were commanded to intercalate the years, for if it were not for this addition of a month, at times [Sukkos would fall] during the middle of the summer or the winter. 
<b>You shall celebrate —</b> peace-offerings for the festival sacrifice.
<b>Seven days,</b> if he did not bring [the sacrifice] on one [day], he brings it another [day]. Perhaps he brings them all seven [days]? The verse says: <b>You shall celebrate it —</b> one day is meant, and not more. Why [then] is “seven” said? For the [supplementary] payment period. 

### passuk 40
<b>Fruit of the beautiful tree,</b> a tree the taste of whose wood and fruit are the same. 
<b>Beautiful,</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>which remain on its tree from year to year — and this is the אֶתְרג [= citron]. 
<b>A branch of palm trees.</b> [Since the word כַּפּוֹת, “branches” appears] without a <i>vov</i>, this teaches that there is only <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>one [palm branch]. 
<b>Boughs of thick-leaved trees,</b> whose branches are intertwined like ropes and like cords, and this is the הֲדַס [= myrtle] which is shaped like a braid. 

### passuk 41

### passuk 42
<b>Native born,</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>this is the native-born, [and so the word] <b>Israelite</b> [which follows, is seemingly unnecessary, and comes] to include converts. 

### passuk 43
<b>That in the sukkos I caused to dwell,</b> [in] clouds of glory.
