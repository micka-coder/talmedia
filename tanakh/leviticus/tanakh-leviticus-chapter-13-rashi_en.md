### passuk 2
<b>A spot of intense whiteness or an off-white spot, etc.</b> These are the names of the skin-eruptions, [each] whiter than the other. 
<b>A snow-white spot.</b> Bright spots, <i>taie</i> in Old French, and so [too the word בָּהִיר in the verse] “bright in the heavens.” 
<b>To Aharon, etc.</b> It is <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>a Scriptural decree, that [the declaration] of the impurity of skin-eruptions and their purification is only by authority of a <i>Kohen</i>. 

### passuk 3
<b>and [if] the hair in the skin-eruption has turned white.</b> At first black, it turned to white <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>within the skin-eruption; <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the mininum [amount of] hair is two [individual hairs]. 
<b>Deeper than the skin of his body.</b> Every [mark of] white appearance [seems] deeper [than the surrounding skin], <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>as the appearance [of anything lit by] the sun is deeper than the shadow. 
<b>And declare him to be unclean.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>He must say to him: You are unclean,” for a white hair is a sign of uncleanness. [This is] a Scriptural decree. 

### passuk 4
<b>And it does not appear deeper than the skin.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>I do not know its [proper] interpretation.
<b>Shall confine.</b> He confines him to <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>one house, and he may not be seen until the end of the week, [at which point] the signs will prove [his status]. 

### passuk 5
<b>Its hue.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Its appearance and original size.
<b>And confine him . . . a second time.</b> Thus, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>if it spread during the first week [of confinement], he is definitely impure. 

### passuk 6
<b>Became dimmer.</b> Became dimmer than its [original] appearance; thus if its appearance remained unchanged <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>or it spread, he is [ritually] impure. 
<b>It is [merely] a white discoloration.</b> [מִסְפַּחַת is] the name of a [ritually] clean skin eruption.
<b>He shall wash his garments and he will be cleansed.</b> Since he required confinement [at one time], he is considered unclean [in some sense], and requires immersion [in a מִקְוֶה]. 

### passuk 7

### passuk 8
<b>The Kohen shall declare him unclean.</b> And from [the time] he declared him unclean, he is definitely [unclean], and requires birds and shaving <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>and a sacrifice as mentioned in the <i>parashoh</i> of “ זאת תִּהְיֶה .” 
<b>It is tzora’as — </b><i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>this white discoloration.
<b>Tzora’as.</b> [This noun] is of feminine gender, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i> נֶגַּע [= “skin eruption, mark”] is masculine. 

### passuk 9

### passuk 10
<b>Or healthy.</b> <i>Sainement</i> in Old French — part of the whiteness within the intensely white spot [turned] to the appearance of flesh. This too is a sign of uncleanness — white hair without healthy [flesh], <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>as well as healthy [flesh] without white hair; and even though healthy [flesh] is mentioned only regarding an intensely white spot, also in regard to all the appearances and their secondary types <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>it is a sign of uncleanness. 

### passuk 11
<b>It is an old tzora’as.</b> [There is] old wound under the healthy [flesh], and this spot appears healthy above [the wound], [but] beneath it is filled with pus — so that you should not say, “Since <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>it has produced healthy [flesh], I will declare it clean.” 

### passuk 12
<b>From his head </b><i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>of a man until his feet.
<b>To the extent that the Kohen can see,</b> excluding a <i>Kohen</i> who has become short-sighted. 

### passuk 13

### passuk 14
<b>On the day healthy flesh appears on him.</b> If healthy [flesh] has sprung up in it — but it has already been explained that healthy [flesh] is a sign of uncleanness! Rather, [this refers] to a skin-eruption which [appeared] in one of the twenty-four tips of limbs which do not become unclean because of [the sign of] healthy flesh — because the skin eruption cannot be seen all at once, since [the limbs] slope on either side. The tip of the limb [subsequently] changed and the sloping side became exposed through fat, as for example it became healthy and broadened, [so that] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>healthy [flesh] could be seen — the verse teaches us that it becomes unclean. 
<b>On the day.</b> What does the verse teach us: “And on the day”? To teach us that there is a day on which you examine it, and there is a day on which you do not examine it. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>From here they [the Sages] said: A bridegroom is given all seven days of festivity, for him, his robe, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>his garments, and his house, and so too <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>during a festival, he is given all the days of the festival. 

### passuk 15
<b>It is tzora’as — </b>that flesh. בָּשָׂר, [flesh], is masculine. 

### passuk 16

### passuk 17

### passuk 18
<b>An inflammation.</b> An expression of being heated, for the flesh has become inflamed with an injury which came to him <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>because of a wound, [and] not by fire.
<b> That has healed.</b> [That is,] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the inflammation has healed, and in its place another skin eruption has appeared. 

### passuk 19
<b>Or a snow-white spot tinged with red.</b> That [is], the skin eruption is not plain white, but variegated and <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>intermingled with two colors — white and red. 

### passuk 20
<b>Its appearance is lower [than the skin].</b> Not that its substance is lower, but because of its whiteness it appears low and deep, as the appearance [of anything illuminated by] the sun [seems] deeper than shadow. 

### passuk 21

### passuk 22
<b>It is a skin eruption — </b>this [spot of] intense whiteness or snow-white [spot].

### passuk 23
<b>In its place,</b> [that is, not literally, “beneath it,” but] in its place. 
<b>A scar of the inflammation.</b> As its Targum: “the impression of the inflammation,” it is only an impression of the inflammation which is seen in the flesh. Any scar is an expression of wrinkling of the skin which becomes wrinkled because of inflammation, as [in the verse]: “and every face shall become shrivelled.” <i>Retrecir</i> in Old French. 
<b>Scar.</b> <i>Retrecissement</i> in Old French.

### passuk 24
<b>Healthy flesh of the burnt part.</b> <i>Sainement</i> [in Old French]. When the burnt part healed, it became a variegated snow-white spot or plain white. The signs of a burnt spot and the signs of an inflammation are the same; why [then] did the Torah separate them? To tell you that they cannot be combined one with the other. [If] inflammation [the size of] half a half-bean develops, and half a half-bean of burnt spot, they may not be judged as a [whole] half-bean. 

### passuk 25

### passuk 27

### passuk 28

### passuk 29
<b>On the head or in the beard.</b> The verse comes to distinguish between a skin-eruption in a hairy part [of the body] and a skin-eruption on a fleshy [part of the body]; for the sign of [impurity] of one is a white hair, and the sign of [impurity] of the other is a golden hair. 

### passuk 30
<b>There is a golden hair in it.</b> [That is,] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the black hair in it turned golden. 
<b>It is a nesek,</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>such is the name of a skin eruption in a hairy part [of the body]. 

### passuk 31
<b>And there is no black hair in it.</b> Thus, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>if there was a black hair in it, he is [ritually] clean and there is no need for confinement, for the black hair is a sign of purity in regard to <i>nesokim</i>, as it is said, “And a black hair grew in it, [the <i>nesek</i> is healed, he is clean].” 

### passuk 32
<b>And behold, it did not spread, etc.</b> Thus, if it spread <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>or there was in it a golden hair, it is unclean. 

### passuk 33
<b>He shall be shaved</b> around the <i>nesek</i>.
<b>but he shall not shave the nesek.</b> He leaves two hairs next to it all around, in order that its spread should be recognizable, for if it spreads, it will pass the hairs and enter the shaven [part of the skin]. 

### passuk 34

### passuk 35
<b>After he is pronounced clean.</b> [I know] only if it spreads after [his] release [that he is unclean], from where [do I know that this applies] even at the end of the first week or the end of the second week? The verse says: “if it certainly spreads.” 

### passuk 36

### passuk 37
<b>And black hair.</b> From where [do we know] that even green or red [is a sign of purity], since it [= the color of the hair] is not gold? The verse says: “<i>and</i> hair.” The expression <i>tzohov</i> [refers to anything] resembling the appearance of gold. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i><i>Tzohov</i> [is] like <i>zohov</i>, <i>orpale</i> in Old French. 
<b>He is clean, and the Kohen shall declare him clean.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Thus, an unclean [person] whom the <i>Kohen</i> declares clean is not clean. 

### passuk 38
<b>white spots,</b> spots. 

### passuk 39
<b>Dim white spots,</b> where their whiteness is not strong, but pale. 
<b>Scurf.</b> Like whiteness which is seen in the flesh of a red-complexioned man, who is called <i>rouge</i> [in Old French], between his freckles — this is called “scurf,” like a like a man who is covered with freckles, where between each freckle the flesh glows with a strong white hue. 

### passuk 40
<b>He is [merely] bald; he is clean.</b> He is clean of the uncleanness of <i>nesek</i>, for he is not judged by the signs of head and beard, which [apply] to a hairy part [of the body], but rather by the signs of a skin eruption of the flesh — (white hair), healthy [flesh], and spreading. 

### passuk 41
<b>If on the front of his head.</b> From the slope of his skull toward his face is called <i>gabachas</i> — even the temples on either side are included. From the slope of his skull toward his back is called <i>karachas</i>.

### passuk 42
<b>A white skin eruption, tinged with red — </b>variegated. From where [do we know the rule regarding] other appearances? The verse says: “skin eruption. As the appearance of <i>tzora’as</i> of the skin of the flesh.” Like the appearance of the <i>tzora’as</i> which is mentioned in the <i>parashoh</i> of “the skin of the flesh” — “When a person will have, in the skin of his flesh,” and what is said there? That he becomes unclean with four [types of] appearances, and is judged with [confinement of a maximum] of two weeks. It is not like the appearance of <i>tzora’as</i> mentioned in [regard] to inflammations and burnt parts, where he is judged with [confinement] of one week. It is also not like the appearance of <i>nesokin</i> in the hairy parts [of the head], which do not cause uncleaness by four [types of] appearance: a spot of intense whiteness and its second, a snow-white spot and its second. 

### passuk 43

### passuk 44
<b>His skin eruption is on his head.</b> I [know the following laws] only of <i>nesokin</i>; from where [do I know] to include <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>other afflicted persons? The verse says: “He must surely declare him unclean” — to include all of them. Regarding all of them it says: “His clothes shall have a tear in them, [his hair shall grow long, etc.”] 

### passuk 45
<b>Have a tear in them,</b> torn. 
<b>Be grown long.</b> Hair grown long.
<b>And he must cover his head down to his upper lips,</b> like a mourner. 
<b>Upper lip,</b> the hair of the lips, <i>grenon</i> in Old French. 
<b>And “Unclean, unclean” shall he call out.</b> He must announce that he is unclean <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>[so that people] will keep away from him. 

### passuk 46
<b>He shall dwell alone — </b>that other unclean persons shall not dwell with him. Our Rabbis said: Why is he different from other unclean persons to dwell alone? Since <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>by his slanderous tongue, he separated man from his wife, and a man from his fellow Jew, so he too will be separated. 
<b>Beyond the encampment.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Beyond the three encampments.

### passuk 47

### passuk 48
<b>In a linen garment and a woolen garment.</b> Of linen <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>or of wool.
<b>Or with leather — </b>this [refers to] leather with which no work was done.
<b>Or in any object made of leather — </b>this [refers to] a leather with which work was done.

### passuk 49
<b>Green,</b> deep green. 
<b>Red,</b> deep red. 

### passuk 50

### passuk 51
<b>A prickly tzora’as.</b> As in the expression, “a <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>prickly brier,” <i>poignant</i> in Old French. And its midrashic intepretation: Give him a curse (מְאֵרָה) that he may not benefit therefrom. 

### passuk 52
<b>Be it in wool or in linen.</b> Of wool or of linen — this is its plain meaning. And its midrashic interpretation: Perhaps he should bring fleeces <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>of wool or stalks of flax and burn them with it? The verse says: “<i>It</i> shall be burned in fire” — it does not need anything else with it. If so, why does the verse say: “be it in wool or in linen”? <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>To exclude [from burning] the borders in it made from another material. The word אוּמְרִיּוֹת is an expression of “edge,” like אִימְרָא, “border.” 

### passuk 53

### passuk 54
<b>The article having the eruption.</b> Perhaps [washing is required] of <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the place of the eruption alone? The verse says: “the <i>article</i> having the eruption” — perhaps [then] the entire garment requires washing? <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The verse says: “the eruption.” How is this possible? He should wash some of the garment along with it.

### passuk 55
<b>After it was washed,</b> a passive construction. 
<b>The eruption did not change its hue.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>It did not fade from its [original] color.
<b>And the eruption did not spread.</b> We understand that if it did not turn [color] and did not spread, it is unclean — <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>all the more so if it did not turn [color] but spread. [But if] it turned [color] but did not spread, I do not know <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>what should be done with it. [Therefore] the verse says: “He shall confine the eruption” — in any case, so the words of R. Yehudah. But the Sages say, etc., as it is in Toras Kohanim. I make mention of this here [in order] to explain th[is] verse properly. 
<b>It is a deep mark.</b> An expression [denoting] a pit, as [in the verse] “in one of the pits,” that is to say, it is deep, an eruption whose appeared is sunken. 
<b>Be it in a worn garment or be it in a new garment.</b> As its Targum, “in its worn state or in its new state.” 
<b>In a worn,</b> worn, old. And [these expressions are used] for the midrashic interpretation which requires a גְזֵרָה שָׁוָה . How do we know that if [the eruption’s] spreading over [the entire garment] [is considered a sign] of cleanness for garments? קָרַחַת and גַבַּחַת is said in [regard] to a person, and קָרַחַת and גַבַּחַת is said in [regard] to a garments, just as in the former case [if] it spread throughout all of it it is clean, so here [if] it spread throughout all of it, it is clean. Therefore, the verse seized on the expression of קָרַחַת and גַבַּחַת . Regarding the matter of its Targum[ic interpretation] this is its [plain] meaning: קַרַחַת is an expression [denoting] “old” and גַבַּחַת is an expression [denoting] “new,” as though it were written “at its end or at its beginning.” Because קָּרַחַת is an expression [denoting] the back, and גַּבַּחַת is an expression [denoting] the front, as it is written: “and if on the front [of his head],” and the קָּרַחַת [refers to] anything which slopes down and descends from the skull and to the back. So it is explained in Toras Kohanim. 

### passuk 56
<b>He shall tear it.</b> He shall tear the place of the eruption from the garment <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>and burn it.

### passuk 57
<b>It is a recurrent outbreak.</b> Something which returns and erupts.
<b>You shall burn it in fire — </b>the whole garment.

### passuk 58
<b>The eruption disappears from them,</b> if when they wash it at first, by order of the <i>Kohen,</i> the eruption disappears from it entirely. 
<b>It shall be washed a second time.</b> An expression of immersion [in a <i>mikveh</i>]; the Targum[ic expression] of “washing” in this section is an expression of whitening. “and it shall be whitened” — except for this [case], where it [refers] not to whitening but to immersion. Therefore its Targum is “and it shall be dipped.” So too all clothes washing — which [really refer to] immersion are translated [into Aramaic] as “and it shall be dipped.”
