### passuk 2
<b>I am Adonoy, your God,</b> I am He who said at Sinai: “I am Adonoy your God,” and you accepted My kingship upon on yourselves; therefore, accept My decrees [which follow]. Rabbi [Judah the Prince] says: It was revealed and known before Him that they will eventually tear [themselves] loose [from the laws] of forbidden relations in the days of Ezra; therefore, He came to them with a decree: <b>I am Adonoy your God —</b> know Who decrees [this] on you, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>a Judge who will exact punishment and [Who] is faithful in giving reward. 

### passuk 3
<b>After the practices of the Land of Egypt.</b> This tells [us] that the practices of the Egyptians and Canaanites were the most corrupt of all the nations, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>and that place in which the Israelites settled was the most corrupt of all. 
<b>To which I am bringing you.</b> This tells [us] that those nations which the Israelites conquered were the most corrupt of all.
<b>And you shall not follow their statutes.</b> What did Scripture leave [unsaid] which was not previously stated? Rather, this verse refers to their customs, matters which are [social] obligations for them, such as [attending] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>theaters and stadiums. Rabbi Meir says: These are the “ways of the Amorites” which the Sages enumerated. 

### passuk 4
<b>You shall fulfill My laws,</b> these are matters mentioned <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>in the Torah as law, which if they were not mentioned, would have been proper to mention. 
<b>And keep My statutes,</b> matters which are a royal decree, against which the evil inclination raises objections: Why should we keep them? And the nations of the world raise objections against them; such as [the law against] eating of pork, the wearing of <i>shaatnez,</i> and the purification [power] of מֵי חַטָּאת . Therefore, it is said: <b>I am Adonoy,</b> My decree is upon you, you may not evade [them]. 
<b>To follow them.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>You may not evade them, that you not think: “I have learned the wisdom of Israel, I will go and learn the wisdom of the nations.” 

### passuk 5
<b>You shall keep My statutes, etc.</b> [This comes] to include <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>other subdivisions [of these laws] which the Torah has not detailed. Another interpretation: it provides for <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>keeping and fulfilling the statutes and keeping and fulfilling the laws, for [until now the Torah] only provided “fulfilling” for laws, and “keeping” for statutes. 
<b>He shall live through them,</b> in the World to Come, for if you say [that this refers] to this world, will he not in the end die [even if he keeps the <i>mitzvos</i>]? 
<b>I am Adonoy,</b> faithful to give a reward [to those deserving of it]. 

### passuk 6
<b>You shall not approach,</b> [the word תִּקְרְבוּ] provides a warning for a female as [well as] a male, and therefore it is expressed <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>in plural form. 
<b>I am Adonoy,</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>faithful to give a reward [to those deserving of it]. 

### passuk 7
<b>The nakedness of your father,</b> this [refers] to your father’s wife — or perhaps it [follows] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>its plain meaning? “The nakedness of your father” is said here, and it is said later, “the nakedness of his father he uncovered”, just as later [the phrase refers] to the wife of his father, here too [the phrase] refers to the wife of his father. 
<b>And the nakedness of your mother,</b> to include his mother <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>[who] is not the wife of his father. 

### passuk 8
<b>The nakedness of your father’s wife,</b> to extend [the prohibition even] after [his father’s] death. 

### passuk 9
<b>Your father’s daughter,</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>even the daughter of a [woman] raped [by your father]. 
<b>Whether she is born in the house or she is born outside —</b> whether they tell your father: “Maintain her mother [as your wife],” and whether they tell him: “Divorce her mother,” as [in the case of] a מַמְזֶרֶת or a נְתִינָה . 

### passuk 10
<b>The nakedness of your son’s daughter, etc.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>His daughter [from a woman he] raped, is mentioned in the verse, and [regarding] his daughter and daughter’s daughter from his wife <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>we learn from the [prohibition] of “the nakedness of a woman and her daughter,” of which it is said, “you may not uncover,” whether she is [offspring] of his or from another man. 
<b>The nakedness of your son’s daughter,</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>[This could be derived by] a קַל וָחמֶר for your [own] daughter, but because we do not derive a prohibition from a logical argument, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>[it was] derived from a גְזֵרָה שָׁוָה in Tractate Yevomos. 

### passuk 11
<b>The nakedness of the daughter of your father’s wife.</b> [This] teaches us that he is not liable for [marrying] his sister [born] of a handmaiden or a non-Jewish woman; therefore it is said: “the daughter of your father’s wife” — [referring] to [a woman] fit for marriage.

### passuk 12

### passuk 13

### passuk 14
<b>The nakedness of your father’s brother you shall not uncover.</b> And what is nakedness? <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>You shall not approach his wife.

### passuk 15
<b>Your son’s wife.</b> I said this only when your son has a [legal] marital relationship with her, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>excluding a woman raped, a handmaiden or a non-Jewish woman. 

### passuk 16

### passuk 17
<b>The nakedness of a woman and her daughter.</b> The verse forbade [them] only by means of the marriage of the first, and that is why it is said, “you shall not take” — an expression of “taking [in marriage].” So too in the context of the punishment: “[a man] who takes a woman and her mother” — [there too] an expression of “taking [in marriage].” <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>But if he raped a woman, he is permitted to marry her daughter. 
<b>They are kin,</b> they are related to one another. 
<b>It is lewdness,</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>an [evil] plan, as it Targum [states]: “a sinful plan,” that your [evil] inclination advises you to sin. 

### passuk 18
<b>And her sister,</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>both as one. 
<b>To vex [her],</b> an expression of vexation, to make one a vexation for the other. 
<b>In her lifetime.</b> [This] teaches you that if he divorced her, he may not marry her sister <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>as long as [his former wife] is alive. 

### passuk 19

### passuk 20

### passuk 21
<b>To Molech.</b> This is an idolatrous form of worship whose name is “<i>Molech,</i>” and this is its worship: that he hands over his son to priests, and they make two large bonfires, and they made the son pass on foot between the two bonfires. 
<b>You shall not hand over</b> this [refers] to his handing over [his son] to the priests.
<b>To be passed through Molech,</b> this [refers] to passing [the child] through the fire. 

### passuk 22

### passuk 23
<b>It is defilement.</b> An expression of prostitution, incest and adultery, and so too: “My anger is against their depravity.” Another interpretation: It is תֶּבֶל : an expression of mixing and intermixture of the seed of mankind and the seed of animals. 

### passuk 24

### passuk 25

### passuk 26

### passuk 27

### passuk 28
<b>[So that] the land not expel you.</b> A parable: [This may be compared to] a king’s son whom they fed a disgusting food, which did not remain in his bowels but [which] he vomited — <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>so is the Land of Israel: It cannot sustain sinners. And its Targum[ic interpretation]: “that it not empty out,” and expression of emptying out — it empties itself out of them. 

### passuk 29
<b>Anyone who will do,</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>both male and female are implied. 

### passuk 30
<b>You shall keep My watch —</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>to warn the Court on this.
<b>And you will not defile yourselves through them; I am Adonoy your God.</b> Thus, if you become defiled, I am not your God, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>and you are cut off from Me, and what benefit do I have from you [then] if you are liable to destruction? Therefore it is said: “I am Adonoy your God.”
