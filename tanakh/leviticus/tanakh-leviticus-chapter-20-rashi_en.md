### passuk 2
<b>And to Bnei Yisroel you shall say:</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the punishments for the prohibitions [already given].
<b>He shall surely be put to death —</b> by a court. And if the court does not have the power, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the people of the land shall assist them. 
<b>The people of the land,</b> the people <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>for whose sake the land was created, the people who are destined to take possession of the land through these <i>mitzvohs.</i> 

### passuk 3
<b>I shall direct My wrath,</b> My <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>“free time” — I will turn from all My [other] concerns and concern Myself with him. 
<b>That man —</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>and not a congregation, for an entire congregation is not cut off. 
<b>For he gave of his children to Molech.</b> Because it is said: “Who causes his son and his daughter to pass through fire,” his son’s son and his daughter’s son — <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>from where [do we know that they are included?] The verse says: “For he gave of his children to <i>Molech.</i>” From where [do we know this of] illegitimate offspring? The verse says: “When he gives of his children to <i>Molech.</i>” 
<b>In order to defile My Sanctuary —</b> the Community of Israel, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>which is sanctified to Me, as in the expression: “That he not profane My Sanctuary.” 

### passuk 4
<b>And if they hide [their eyes],</b> if they hide [their eyes] in one matter, in the end they will hide [their eyes] in many matters. If a minor Sanhedrin hide [their eyes], in the end the Great Sanhedrin will hide [its eyes]. 

### passuk 5
<b>And [against] his family.</b> Said Rabbi Shimon: “What sin did the family commit”? Rather, [this] teaches you that there is no family which has a tax-farmer in it that is not entirely [made up] of tax-farmers — <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>for all of them protect him. 
<b>I shall cut him off.</b> Why is this said? Since it is said, <b>and against his family,</b> perhaps the entire family will be [punished] with <i>koreis</i>? The verse says: <b>him</b> — he [will be punished] with <i>koreis</i>, but the entire family [will] not [be punished] with <i>koreis</i>, but with suffering. 
<b>To go astray after Molech.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>[This phrase] includes worship of any other idol which he served in this way [passing children between the fires], even if this is not [its usual] worship. 

### passuk 6

### passuk 7
<b>You shall sanctify yourselves — </b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>this [refers to] separation from idolatry.

### passuk 8

### passuk 9
<b>He has cursed his father or mother — </b> [the repetition of] this phrase comes] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>to include [cursing them] after [the] death [of either].
<b>His blood is on him —</b> this [refers to] stoning, and so too every place it is said “his blood is on him,” “their blood is on them,” [it refers to stoning]. And we have learned this from [the punishment of] an אוֹב and יִדְעוֹנִי, regarding whom it is said: “You shall stone them to death, their blood is on them.” [However,] the plain sense of the verse is similar to “his blood is on his head,” [i.e., the responsibility is his,] no one deserves punishment for his death but himself — he brought it upon himself that he should be executed. 

### passuk 10
<b>A man,</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>excluding a minor. 
<b>Who commits adultery with another man’s wife,</b> excluding a minor’s wife [from the death penalty]. This teaches us that there is no legal marriage for a minor. [If so,] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>regarding which married woman have I required you [to exact the death penalty]? 
<b>Who commits adultery with the wife of his fellow,</b> excluding a non-Jew’s wife; this teaches us that there is no [binding] marriage for non-Jews. 
<b>They shall surely be put to death — the adulterer and the adulteress.</b> Any death penalty mentioned in the Torah without [further] specification [as to its nature], [refers] only to <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>strangulation. 

### passuk 11

### passuk 12
<b>They have committed an act of perversion,</b> disgrace. Another interpretation: <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>They mix the seed of the father with the seed of the son. 

### passuk 13
<b>In the same manner as with a woman,</b> [as] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>one inserts the painting <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>stick in the tube. 

### passuk 14
<b>They shall be burnt in fire, he and them.</b> You cannot say that they should burn his first wife, for he married her legally, and she was [never] forbidden to him, [but] rather “a woman and her mother,” which are written here [is when] both [were] forbidden [to him to begin with] — if he married his mother-in-law and her mother. There are those of our Rabbis who say: Only his mother-in-law is [mentioned] here; [to] what [then does] “them” [refer]? [It means] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>“one of them,” [as] in the Greek language” <i>hen</i> is “one.” 

### passuk 15
<b>And you shall also kill the animal.</b> If the man sinned, what sin did the animal commit? Rather, because a mishap occurred through it, the verse said: “Let it be stoned.” [This may be argued as] a <i>kal vo-homer</i> [All the more so] a human [should be punished], who knows how to distinguish between good and evil, and causes evil to his fellow to commit a sin. Similar to this matter do you say: “You should certainly destroy all the places [where the nations worshipped their gods].” Behold, the matter [gives rise to a] <i>kal vo-homer</i>: If trees, which cannot see and cannot hear, [if] because a mishap occurred through them, the Torah said: “Destroy, burn and put an end to” — one who turns his fellow away from the way of life to paths of death, how much more so [should he be punished]!” 

### passuk 16

### passuk 17
<b>It is a shameful perversion.</b> An Aramaic expression: shamefulness. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>And its midrashic interpretation: And if you argue that Cain married his sister, [I can reply] that God performed an act of kindness to build up the world through him, as it is said: “The world is built [in] kindness.” 

### passuk 18
<b>And uncover,</b> “uncover,” and so every expression of “nakedness” is [an expression] of “uncovering.” The <i>vov</i> enters the word ערה [to convert it] into a noun, like זַעֲוָה from the root “he did not rise and did not tremble (זָע),” and so אַחֲוָה from the root אָח . As to “uncovering,” our Rabbis disagreed about it. Some say that this [refers] to entrance of the very tip, and other say this [refers] to entrance of the top. 

### passuk 19
<b>The nakedness of your mother’s sister, etc.</b> The verse repeated its prohibition, to say that he is prohibited regarding them — whether [it involves] his father’s or mother’s sister from the father’s side, or [it involves] their sisters from [the same] mother, but regarding the nakedness of the wife of his father’s brother, he was prohibited only concerning the wife of his father’ brother from [the same] father. 

### passuk 20
<b>Who will lie [conjugally] with his aunt.</b> This verse comes to teach regarding <i>koreis</i> mentioned above, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>that it [involves] the punishment of remaining childless. 
<b>Without children,</b> as its Targum, “without offspring.” Similar to it: “Since I continue to be childless.” [If] he has children, he buries them; [if] he does not have children, he dies without children. Therefore [the Torah] repeats these two verses: “they will die childless,” “they will remain childless.” <b>They will die without children.</b> If he has [children] at the time of the sin, he will not have any when he dies, for he will bury them in his own lifetime. <b>They will die without children.</b> If he has none at the time of the sin, he will remain all his life as he is now. 

### passuk 21
<b>Who must be [conjugally] avoided [by him].</b> This cohabitation is to be kept at a distance and is loathsome. And our Rabbis expounded [this verse] to forbid [intimate] contact with her as with a menstruant woman, in regard to whom contact is specified: “he uncovered her source [= her womb].” 

### passuk 22

### passuk 23
<b>I became disgusted,</b> an expression of disgust, like “I am disgusted with my life,” as a person who is disgusted with his food. 

### passuk 24

### passuk 25
<b>You shall distinguish between a [ritually] clean animal and an unclean one.</b> It is not necessary to state: between a cow and a donkey, for they are clearly differentiated [in feature and form], but between that which is [ritually] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>pure for you and that which is [ritually] impure for you — between [an animal] which has been slaughtered by cutting the greater part of each organ, and one which has been slaughtered [by cutting] half. And how much is there between the greater part and half? A hair’s-breadth. 
<b>Which I have distinguished for you as being unclean —</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>to forbid.

### passuk 26
<b>And I have distinguished you from the [other] peoples to be mine.</b> If you are separated from them [by not performing forbidden acts], behold, you are Mine, but if not, behold, you are Nebuchadnezzar’s and his cohorts. Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariyoh says: From where [do we know] that a person should not say: “I am disgusted with pig meat, it is impossible for me to wear mixed kinds,” but rather he should say: “I can, but what can I do, [now] that my Father in Heaven has decreed upon me [that I may not]? The verse says: “And I have distinguished you from the other peoples to be mine,” that your separation from them should be for My Name’s sake — he separates himself from sin and [thus] accepts on himself the yoke of the Kingdom of Heaven. 

### passuk 27
<b>If there be among them a medium, etc.</b> Here the death penalty is stated for them, and above [the penalty is] כָּרֵת . [If there are] witnesses and proper warning, [he is liable] to stoning; [if he does it] intentionally, [but] without [proper] warning, he [receives] כָּרֵת ; and for an unintentional sin, [he must bring a] sin offering, and so in regard to all [sins which involve] liability to the death penalty, regarding which כָּרֵת is stated.
