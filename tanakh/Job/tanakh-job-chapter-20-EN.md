Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said:

### passuk 2
Therefore do my thoughts give answer to me, Even by reason of mine agitation that is in me.

### passuk 3
I have heard the reproof which putteth me to shame, But out of my understanding my spirit answereth me.

### passuk 4
Knowest thou not this of old time, Since man was placed upon earth,

### passuk 5
That the triumphing of the wicked is short, And the joy of the godless but for a moment?

### passuk 6
Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, And his head reach unto the clouds;

### passuk 7
Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung; They that have seen him shall say: ‘Where is he?’

### passuk 8
He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found; Yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.

### passuk 9
The eye which saw him shall see him no more; Neither shall his place any more behold him.

### passuk 10
His children shall appease the poor, And his hands shall restore his wealth.

### passuk 11
His bones are full of his youth, But it shall lie down with him in the dust.

### passuk 12
Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, Though he hide it under his tongue;

### passuk 13
Though he spare it, and will not let it go, But keep it still within his mouth;

### passuk 14
Yet his food in his bowels is turned, It is the gall of asps within him.

### passuk 15
He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again; God shall cast them out of his belly.

### passuk 16
He shall suck the poison of asps; The viper’s tongue shall slay him.

### passuk 17
He shall not look upon the rivers, The flowing streams of honey and curd.

### passuk 18
That which he laboured for shall he give back, and shall not swallow it down; According to the substance that he hath gotten, he shall not rejoice.

### passuk 19
For he hath oppressed and forsaken the poor; He hath violently taken away a house, and he shall not build it up.

### passuk 20
Because he knew no quietness within him, In his greed he suffered nought to escape,

### passuk 21
There was nothing left that he devoured not— Therefore his prosperity shall not endure. .

### passuk 22
In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits; The hand of every one that is in misery shall come upon him.

### passuk 23
It shall be for the filling of his belly; He shall cast the fierceness of His wrath upon him, And shall cause it to rain upon him into his flesh.

### passuk 24
If he flee from the iron weapon, The bow of brass shall strike him through.

### passuk 25
He draweth it forth, and it cometh out of his body; Yea, the glittering point cometh out of his gall; Terrors are upon him.

### passuk 26
All darkness is laid up for his treasures; A fire not blown by man shall consume him; It shall go ill with him that is left in his tent.

### passuk 27
The heavens shall reveal his iniquity, And the earth shall rise up against him.

### passuk 28
The increase of his house shall depart, His goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath.

### passuk 29
This is the portion of a wicked man from God, And the heritage appointed unto him by God.
