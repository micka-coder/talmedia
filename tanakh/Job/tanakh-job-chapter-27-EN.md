### passuk 1
And Job again took up his parable, and said:

### passuk 2
As God liveth, who hath taken away my right; And the Almighty, who hath dealt bitterly with me;

### passuk 3
All the while my breath is in me And the spirit of God is in my nostrils,

### passuk 4
Surely my lips shall not speak unrighteousness, Neither shall my tongue utter deceit;

### passuk 5
Far be it from me that I should justify you; Till I die I will not put away mine integrity from me.

### passuk 6
My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go; My heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.

### passuk 7
Let mine enemy be as the wicked, And let him that riseth up against me be as the unrighteous.

### passuk 8
For what is the hope of the godless, though he get him gain, When God taketh away his soul?

### passuk 9
Will God hear his cry, When trouble cometh upon him?

### passuk 10
Will he have his delight in the Almighty, And call upon God at all times?

### passuk 11
I will teach you concerning the hand of God; That which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.

### passuk 12
Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; Why then are ye become altogether vain?

### passuk 13
This is the portion of a wicked man with God, And the heritage of oppressors, which they receive from the Almighty.

### passuk 14
If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword; And his offspring shall not have bread enough.

### passuk 15
Those that remain of him shall be buried by pestilence, And his widows shall make no lamentation.

### passuk 16
Though he heap up silver as the dust, And prepare raiment as the clay;

### passuk 17
He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, And the innocent shall divide the silver.

### passuk 18
He buildeth his house as a moth, And as a booth which the keeper maketh.

### passuk 19
He lieth down rich, but there shall be nought to gather; He openeth his eyes, and his wealth is not.

### passuk 20
Terrors overtake him like waters; A tempest stealeth him away in the night.

### passuk 21
The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth; And it sweepeth him out of his place.

### passuk 22
Yea, it hurleth at him, and spareth not; He would fain flee from its power.

### passuk 23
Men shall clap their hands at him, And shall hiss him out of his place.
