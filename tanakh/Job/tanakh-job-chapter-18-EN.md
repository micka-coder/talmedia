Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said:

### passuk 2
How long will ye lay snares for words? Consider, and afterwards we will speak.

### passuk 3
Wherefore are we counted as beasts, And reputed dull in your sight?

### passuk 4
Thou that tearest thyself in thine anger, Shall the earth be forsaken for thee? Or shall the rock be removed out of its place? .

### passuk 5
Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, And the spark of his fire shall not shine.

### passuk 6
The light shall be dark in his tent, And his lamp over him shall be put out.

### passuk 7
The steps of his strength shall be straitened, And his own counsel shall cast him down.

### passuk 8
For he is cast into a net by his own feet, And he walketh upon the toils.

### passuk 9
A gin shall take him by the heel, And a snare shall lay hold on him.

### passuk 10
A noose is hid for him in the ground, And a trap for him in the way.

### passuk 11
Terrors shall overwhelm him on every side, And shall entrap him at his feet.

### passuk 12
His trouble shall be ravenous, And calamity shall be ready for his fall.

### passuk 13
It shall devour the members of his body, Yea, the first-born of death shall devour his members.

### passuk 14
That wherein he trusteth shall be plucked out of his tent; And he shall be brought to the king of terrors.

### passuk 15
There shall dwell in his tent that which is none of his; Brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.

### passuk 16
His roots shall dry up beneath, And above shall his branch wither.

### passuk 17
His remembrance shall perish from the earth, And he shall have no name abroad.

### passuk 18
He shall be driven from light into darkness, And chased out of the world.

### passuk 19
He shall have neither son nor sonâ€™s son among his people, Nor any remaining in his dwellings.

### passuk 20
They that come after shall be astonished at his day, As they that went before are affrighted.

### passuk 21
Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, And this is the place of him that knoweth not God.
