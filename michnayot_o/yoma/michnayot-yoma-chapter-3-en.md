The supervisor said to them: Go out and see if the time for slaughter has come. If it had come, the one who saw it would say, "Morning star!" Matitia ben Shmuel says [that the supervisor would ask]: Is the whole east light as far as Hevron? And he would say, "Yes!"

### michna 2
And why did they need [to do] thus? For on one occasion the light of the moon appeared and they assumed that dawn had broken, and they slaughtered the tamid [daily offering], and they [had to] take it out to the place of burning [because the offering was not offered at the proper time]. They took the High Priest down to the place of immersion. This is the rule in the Temple: all who move their bowels require immersion, and all who urinate require washing of the hands and feet.

### michna 3
No person comes into the Temple court for service, even if he is already ritually pure, until he immerses. Five immersions and a total of ten ablutions of hands and feet are performed by the High Priest on this Day. All this takes place in the courtyard above the Beit Parvah, except for this one [upon entering the Temple compound, which was performed near the High Priest's chamber by the south gate].

### michna 4
They spread out a linen sheet between him and the people. He stripped off [his clothes], went down and immersed himself, came up and dried himself. They brought him the golden garments, he put them on and washed his hands and feet. They brought him the tamid [offering]. He cut its throat and another finished [the slaughtering] for him. He received the blood and sprinkled it. He went inside to offer the morning incense, to trim the lamp, and to offer the head, the limbs, the chavitim and the wine.

### michna 5
The morning incense was offered between [offering] the blood and the limbs. The afternoon incense was offered between [offering] the limbs and the wine libations. If the high priest was elderly or squeamish, water would be heated for him and poured into the cold water [in which he would immerse] in order to take the cold edge from it.

### michna 6
They then brought him [the High Priest] to Beit Parvah, which was located in the Holy of the Temple. They spread out linen sheets to separate him from the people. He washed his hands and feet and removed his clothing. Rabbi Meir says, first he removed his clothing and then he washed his hands and feet. He went down and immersed, came out and dried himself. They brought him the white garments, he put them on and washed his hands and feet.

### michna 7
In the morning he would wear Pelusian linen worth twelve maneh ; at dusk, Indian linen worth eight hundred zuz, the words of Rabbi Meir. The Sages say: in the morning he would wear [garments] worth eighteen maneh and at dusk [garments] worth twelve maneh, altogether thirty maneh. These [costs] were [borne by] the community, and if he wanted to add [to them], he would add from his own [assets].

### michna 8
He came to his bull and his bull was standing between the Ulam [entrance hall] and the altar, its head to the south and its face [turned] to the west. And the priest stood on the east side facing the west. He laid both his hands upon it and confessed. And thus he would say: “Please, ‘Hashem’! I have done wrong, I have transgressed, I have sinned before You, I and my house. Please, ‘Hashem’! Forgive the wrongdoings, the transgressions, the sins which I have committed and transgressed and sinned before You, I and my house, as it is written in the Torah of Moses Your servant: 'For on this day shall atonement be made for you'," etc. [to cleanse you of all your sins; you shall be clean before the Lord] (Leviticus 16:30). And [when the people heard the four letter Name] they answer after him: “Blessed be the Name of His glorious Kingdom forever and ever”.

### michna 9
He then went to the east of the Temple courtyard, to the north of the altar, the deputy High Priest at his right and the head of the [priestly] family [ministering that week] at his left. There were two goats and an urn was there, and in it were two lots. They were of boxwood and Ben Gamla made them of gold, and they would mention his name in praise.

### michna 10
Ben Katin made twelve spigots for the laver, for there had been before only two. He also made a mechanism for the laver, in order that its water should not become unfit by remaining overnight. King Munbaz had the handles of all the vessels used on Yom Kippur made of gold. His mother Helena made a golden candelabrum over the opening of the Temple sanctuary. She also made a golden tablet, on which the portion concerning the suspected adulteress was inscribed. Nicanor's gates were the subject of miracles. And they were all mentioned in praise.

### michna 11
And these they mentioned to their shame: Those of the House of Garmu did not want to teach anything about the preparation of the showbread. Those of the House of Avtinas did not want to teach anything about the preparation of the incense. Hugros ben Levi knew a chapter [concerning] the song but did not want to teach it. Ben Kamtzar did not want teach anyone his art of writing [the name of God]. Concerning the former [mentioned in the previous Mishnah] it is said: “The memory of the righteous shall be for a blessing” (Proverbs 10:7); concerning the others it is said: “But the name of the wicked shall rot”.
