### michna 1
For rectangular beds of grain that are between olive trees, the school of Shammai says: [Give] Peah [corner of the field that must be given to the poor] from each and every one; the school of Hillel says: [Give] from one for all of them. They concede [however,] that if the heads of the rows are intertwined, one gives Peah from one for all of them.

### michna 2
If one harvests [the ripe stalks of] his field and leaves over moist stalks, Rabbi Akiva says: One gives Peah from each and every one; the Sages say: One gives Peah from one for all of them. The Sages concede to Rabbi Akiva in [a case of] one who sows dill or mustard in three places, that he gives Peah from each and every one.

### michna 3
One who uproots moist onions [to take] to the market, while leaving the dry ones for the granary, gives Peah for both separately. And thus it is for beans, and thus it is for a vineyard. One who thins out [the field] gives from the remnant for the remainder, and one who uproots from one particular area gives from the remnant for the whole.

### michna 4
The [seed] onions are obligated in Peah ; Rabbi Yosi exempts. For the rectangular beds of onions that are between other vegetables, Rabbi Yosi says: Peah must be taken from each and every one; the Sages say: From one for all of them.

### michna 5
When brothers divide [inherited land], they give two Peot. If they become partners, they give one Peah. Two who buy a tree give one Peah. If this one buys the north and that one buys the south, this one gives Peah for his own and that one gives Peah for his own. One who sells [only] the trees in his field [and not the land] must give Peah for each and every one; Rabbi Yehudah said: When is this? In a time when the field owner did not retain any [trees], but if the field owner retained some [trees], he gives Peah for everything.”

### michna 6
Rabbi Eliezer says: Land [the size of a] beit rova [the quarter measurement] is obligated in Peah ; Rabbi Yehoshua says: That [amount of land] which produces two Seah [a specific unit of volume]; Rabbi Tarfon says: Six [hand-breadths] by six hand-breadths. Rabbi Yehudah ben Beteirah says: [The size that would be needed] in order to harvest and repeat, and the law is according to his words. Rabbi Akiva says: Any size of land is obligated in Peah, and in Bikurim [First-fruits that must be brought to the Temple and given to the priest], and a Pruzbul [legal arrangement which avoids the mandatory Sabbatical year cancellation of personal debts by deeding them to the court, and being subsequently appointed their agent for collection] may be written against it, and movable property are acquired along with it by means of money, contract, or chazakah [action taken upon a property to formalize its legal acquisition].

### michna 7
If a dying man writes his property [to another]: if he leaves some land over [for himself], his gift is a gift; if he does not leave any land over, his gift is not a gift. If he writes his property to his children, and writes some land to his wife, she has lost her marriage contract [i.e.,, its lien on those properties]; Rabbi Yosi says: If she accepts [being included with the gift-recipients], even though he did not write it to her, she has lost her marriage contract.

### michna 8
If one writes his property over to his slave, he goes out a freeman. If he leaves some land over [for himself], he does not go out as a freeman. Rabbi Shimon says: He is in all cases a freeman unless he says: ‘Indeed, all my property is given to so-and-so, my slave, except for one out of a multitude that is among them [i.e., an unspecified, though tiny, portion].’
