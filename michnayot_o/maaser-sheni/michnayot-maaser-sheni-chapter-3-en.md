### michna 1
A person may not say to his friend: carry up these fruits to Jerusalem to [get a] share. But he may say to him: carry them up so that we may eat them and we may drink them in Jerusalem. But people may give to one another as a free gift.

### michna 2
Terumah [produce consecrated for priestly consumption] may not be bought with Ma'aser Sheni [second tithe, which must be eaten in Jerusalem] money, because [the number of] those who may eat of it is reduced. But Rabbi Shimon allows it. Rabbi Shimon said to them - If we rule leniently in the case of Shelamim [peace offerings], which can bring them to become Pigul [sacrifice made unfit because of improper intentions] or Notar [sacrifice made unfit because it was left too long uneaten] or impure, why would we not also rule leniently regarding Terumah? They said to him: If we rule leniently in the case of Shelamim, which are permitted to non-priests, shall we rule leniently regarding Terumah, which is forbidden to non-priests?

### michna 3
One who has [ Ma'aser Sheni ] money in Jerusalem and has need for it [for other uses], if his friend has fruits, he may say to his friend, "This money is made Chulin [non-sacred produce, by transferring its holiness] onto your fruits." Thus we find that this [owner of the fruits must] eat his fruits in purity, while the other may use his money for his own needs. But one should not say this to an Am Ha'aretz [one who is lax in observing tithes and purity laws] except in the case of Demai [produce from which it is uncertain if tithes were already taken].

### michna 4
[If one has Chulin ] fruits in Jerusalem and [ Ma'aser Sheni ] coins outside the city, he may say, "This money is made Chulin [by transferring its holiness] onto these fruits." If one has [ Ma'aser Sheni ] coins in Jerusalem and [ Chulin ] fruits outside the city, he may say "This money is made Chulin [by transferring its holiness] onto those fruits," but only if he will bring the fruits up to Jerusalem and eat them there.

### michna 5
[ Ma'aser Sheni ] money may enter and leave Jerusalem, but [ Ma'aser Sheni ] fruit may enter and may not leave. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says, "Even fruit may enter and leave."

### michna 6
Fruits that pass through Jerusalem after being completely prepared: their Ma'aser Sheni must be brought back and eaten in Jerusalem. But if they have not been completely prepared, such as baskets of grapes headed for the winepress or baskets of figs headed for the drying-place: Beit Shammai says: their Ma'aser Sheni must be brought back and eaten in Jerusalem. Beit Hillel says: he may redeem it and eat it anywhere. Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Yosi: Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree about fruits that have not been completely prepared; [both agreed] that he may redeem their Ma'aser Sheni and eat it anywhere. Rather, about what did they disagree? They disagreed about fruits that have been completely prepared: Beit Shammai says: their Ma'aser Sheni must be brought back and eaten in Jerusalem. Beit Hillel says: he may redeem it and eat it anywhere. And Demai may enter and leave and be redeemed.

### michna 7
If a tree stands inside [the walls of Jerusalem] and leans outside, or stands outside and leans inside: from [the part of the tree] aligned with the wall and inwards should be considered inside, and from [the part of the tree] aligned with the wall and outwards should be considered outside. Olive press buildings whose openings are inside the wall but whose chambers are outside the wall, or whose openings are outside the wall but whose chambers are inside the wall: Beit Shammai says: all of it should be considered inside. Beit Hillel says: from [the part of the buildings] aligned with the wall and inwards should be considered inside, and from [the part of the buildings] aligned with the wall and outwards should be considered outside.

### michna 8
The chambers [by the walls of the Temple] that are built in the sacred area and that open out onto the non-sacred area, their insides are non-sacred and their roofs are sacred. If they are built in the non-sacred area and open out onto the sacred area, their insides are sacred and their roofs are non-sacred. If they are built in both the sacred area and non-sacred area and open out onto both the sacred area and the non-sacred area, [the parts of] their insides and roofs that align with the [border of the] sacred area and into the sacred area are sacred, and [the parts that] align with the [border of the] non-sacred area and into the non-sacred area are non-sacred.

### michna 9
Ma'aser Sheni that entered Jerusalem and became impure, whether it became impure from an Av HaTumah [dead creature that transfers the highest level of impurity] or it became impure from a Velad HaTumah [something rendered impure on a derivative level, by contact ultimately with an original source of impurity], whether inside [Jerusalem] or outside [Jerusalem], Beit Shammai say it should be redeemed and should be eaten entirely inside [Jerusalem], unless it became impure from an Av HaTumah outside [Jerusalem]. Beit Hillel say all of it should be redeemed and eaten outside [Jerusalem], unless it became impure from a Velad HaTumah inside [Jerusalem].

### michna 10
That which is bought with Ma'aser Sheni money that became impure should be redeemed. Rabbi Yehuda says, it should be buried. They [the Rabbis] said to Rabbi Yehuda, "But since if Ma'aser Sheni itself becomes impure, it must be redeemed, then that which is bought with Ma'aser Sheni money that became impure, is it not the law that it should be redeemed?" He said to them, "No. If you say [this] with regard to Ma'aser Sheni itself, which may be redeemed when pure in a distant place, shall you say [this] with regard to that which is bought with Ma'aser Sheni money, which may not be redeemed when pure in a distant place?

### michna 11
A deer that was bought with Ma'aser [ Sheni ] money and dies, must be buried along with its skin. Rabbi Shimon says, he must redeem it. If it was bought live and then slaughtered and then became impure, he must redeem it. Rabbi Yose says, he must bury it. If it was bought slaughtered and then became impure, it [the deer] is like fruit [that became impure].

### michna 12
One who lends his jugs for Maaser Sheni [wine], even though he sealed them [after pouring the wine into them], they did not acquire [the status of] Ma'aser [ Sheni ]. If one simply pours into them [without specifying that he is lending them], as long as he does not seal them, they did not acquire [the status of] Ma'aser [ Sheni ]. But from when they are sealed, they acquire [the status of] Ma'aser [ Sheni ]. As long as he does not seal them, they are nullified [if a jug of Terumah wine is lost] in one hundred and one [jugs]. But from when they are sealed, they can make any amount [of jugs] sacred. As long as he does not seal them, he can separate Terumah from one jug for all [the jugs]. But from when they are sealed, he must separate Terumah from each one on its own.

### michna 13
Beit Shammai says: [if one wishes to sell jugs of Ma'aser Sheni wine without making the jugs themselves Ma'aser Sheni,] he opens [the jugs] and pours them into the wine press, and Beit Hillel says: he opens but does not need to pour. With respect to what are these words said? In a place where it is their way to be sold closed, but in a place where it is their way to be sold open, the jug does not become Chulin. But if [the seller] wishes to be strict with himself and sell by [specifying the] measure, the jug becomes Chulin. Rabbi Shimon says: even one who says to his fellow, "This barrel I am selling to you - except for the jugs" - the jug becomes Chulin.
