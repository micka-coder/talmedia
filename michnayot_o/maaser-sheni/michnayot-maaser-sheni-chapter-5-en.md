Kerem Revai [the fruit of vines and trees in the fourth year after their planting. This produce, or its redemption value, must be taken up to Jerusalem and consumed there in ritual purity.], they mark it with clods of earth, and Orlah [fruits in the first three years after their planting, which may not be eaten] with pottery clay, and graves with lime, which he dissolves and pours. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel said: When does this apply? In the Sabbatical year. The conscientious put down coins and say: Any fruit gathered from this [vineyard] will be made into Chulin [non-sacred produce, by transferring their sacredness] to these coins.

### michna 2
Kerem Revai was brought to Jerusalem from a radius of a day-long journey. And what is its boundary? From Eilat in the south and Akrabat in the north. From Lod in the west and the Jordan river in the east. And when the produce increased, they decreed that it could be redeemed even up to the wall. And the matter was conditional—that whenever they wanted, the matter would revert to how it was originally. Rabbi Yosi says: This condition was made when the Temple was destroyed, and the condition was that whenever the Temple would be rebuilt, the matter would revert to how it was originally.

### michna 3
[Regarding] Kerem Revai : Beit Shammai says it does not require an extra fifth [when redeemed] and it does not require removal. Beit Hillel says it does. Beit Shammai says it requires Peret [fallen grapes given to the poor] and Olelot [grapes that do not grow in clusters and are given to the poor], and the poor redeem it for themselves.Beit Hillel says that all of it goes to the wine press.

### michna 4
How do people redeem Neta Revai [the fruit of vines and trees in the fourth year after their planting. This produce, or its redemption value, must be taken up to Jerusalem and consumed there in ritual purity.]? One sets down the basket [of fruit] in front of three, and says: "How much would a man want to redeem with one Selah [specific unit of money] on condition that the expenditures must come from his household?" One then sets down the coins and says: "Anything harvested from this [tree], will be made into Chulin [by transferring its sacredness] to these coins, at [a rate of] so-and-so many baskets for a Selah.

### michna 5
But in the Sabbatical year he must redeem it for its value. And if it was all made Hefker [ownerless property], he can only collect the cost of harvest. One who redeems his Neta Revai adds on a fifth of its value, whether it was his own or given to him as a gift.

### michna 6
The day before the first holiday day of Passover of the fourth and seventh years of the Sabbatical cycle, there was a removal. How was the removal done? They give the Terumah [produce consecrated for priestly consumption], and Terumat Ma'aser [a portion of the tithes that is given to the priest] to the owners, and Ma'aser Rishon [first tithe, which must be given to the Levite] to its owners, and the poor man's tithe to its owners. And Ma'aser Sheni [second tithe, which must be eaten in Jerusalem] and Bikurim [first-fruits that must be given to the priest] require removal everywhere. Rabbi Shimon says: Bikurim are given to the priests like Terumah. Cooked food—the House of Shammai say it must be removed and the House of Hillel say it is as if it has [already] been removed.

### michna 7
If someone has produce in this age, and the time for removal has come, Beit Shammai say that it must be made into Chulin [by transferring its sacredness] onto silver. But Beit Hillel say that it is the same whether it is silver or produce [and thus nothing is gained by the transfer].

### michna 8
Rabbi Yehuda said: Originally, they would send [messages] to all landowners in the countries saying: "Hurry and fix your produce before the time of removal comes." Until Rabbi Akiva came and taught that all fruit that had not reached the stage of tithes are exempt from removal.

### michna 9
Someone whose produce was far away from him, must announce for them a designation. It happened that Rabban Gamliel and the elders were traveling by ship. Rabban Gamliel said: the tenth that I will measure in the future is given to Yehoshua and its location is rented to him. Another tenth that I will measure in the future is given to Akiva ben Yosef so that he will receive it on behalf of the poor and its location is rented to him. Rabbi Yehoshua said: The tenth that I will measure in the future is given to Elazar ben Azaria and its location is rented to him. And they each received payment from the other.

### michna 10
By the afternoon of the last festival day, they would make the declaration. How was the declaration made? "I have removed the Kodesh [consecrated material] from the house" (Deuteronomy 26:13)--this is Ma'aser Sheni and Neta Revai. "Have given them unto the Levite"--this is Ma'aser Levi [The first tithe of produce, which must be given to the Levi]. "And also I have given it"--this is Terumah and Terumat Ma'aser. "And also to the stranger, to the orphan, and to the widow"--this is the poor man's tithe, Leket [fallen gleanings given to the poor], Shikhecha [forgotten gleanings given to the poor], and Pe'ah [corner of a field given to the poor], even though these do not invalidate the confession [if they have not been given]. "From the house"--this is Challah [dough that must be set aside for the priest].

### michna 11
"Like all of Your commandments that you commanded me" (Deuteronomy 26:13). Thus if one preceded Ma'aser Sheni to Ma'aser Rishon, he is not able to recite the confession. "I did not violate Your commandments"--I did not separate [tithes] from one species on behalf of a different species, nor from uprooted produce on behalf of rooted produce, nor from rooted produce on behalf of uprooted produce, nor the Chadash [grain from the current year] on behalf of the Yashan, nor the Yashan on behalf of the Chadash. "I did not forget"--I did not forget to bless You and mention your name for it.

### michna 12
"I have not eaten from it in my mourning" (Deut. 26:14). Thus if he did eat from it in mourning, he cannot confess. "And I have not consumed any of it when unclean." Thus if he separated it while impure, he cannot confess. "And I did not give from it to the dead"--I did not buy with it a coffin or shrouds for the dead, nor did I give it to other mourners. "I listened to the voice of Hashem my G-d"-- I brought it to the Chosen Temple. "I have done everything that you have commanded me"-- I was joyous, and I caused joy with it.

### michna 13
"Gaze from Your holy abode, from the heavens" (Deut. 26:15). We have done what You decreed upon us, so too You do what You promised us, [to] "gaze from Your holy abode, from the heavens, and bless Your nation, Israel" with sons and daughters. "And the land that You have given us" [bless] with dew and rain and the offspring of cattle. "Just as You have sworn to our forefathers, a land flowing with milk and honey" so that You will give taste to the fruit.

### michna 14
From this they said, Israelites and bastards confess, but not converts and not freed slaves, for they do not have a portion in the land. Rabbi Meir says, even priests and Levites do not, for they did not take a portion in the land. Rabbi Yosi says, they have cities [with surrounding] open land.

### michna 15
Yochanan the High Priest dismissed the confessions of the tithe. He also eliminated those who recited the "Wake up" verse and the knockers [of sacrificial calves]. Until his day, the hammer would be striking in Jerusalem. In his day, no one had to ask about Demai [produce from which it is uncertain if tithes were already taken].
