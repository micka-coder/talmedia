All the substitutes for vows have the validity of vows. Those for haramim have the validity of haramim, And those for oaths have the validity of oaths, And those for nazirite [vows] have the validity of nazirite [vows]. If one says to his fellow, “I am forbidden from you by a vow”; “I am separated from you”; “I am distanced from you”, “that I should eat from yours”, “that I should taste from yours”, he is prohibited. If he says: “I am banned to you”, Rabbi Akiba was inclined to rule stringently. [If one says] “As the vows of the wicked”, he has vowed in respect of being a nazirite, or a sacrifice, or an oath. [If he says] “As the vows of the fit”, he has said nothing. [But if he said] “As their freewill-offerings” he has vowed in respect of being nazirite and a sacrifice.

### michna 2
One who says, “konam” “qonah” or “qonas”: these are the substitutes for korban. “Herek” “herech” or “heref,” these are substitutes for herem. “Nazik” “naziah” “paziah” these are substitutes for nazirite vows. “Shevuthah” “shekukah” or one who vows with the word “mota” these are substitutes for shevuah (an oath).

### michna 3
If one says “Not-unconsecrated food shall I not eat from you”, “Not fit”, or “Not pure”, “Clean” or “Unclean”, “Remnant” or “Piggul he is bound [by his vow]. [If one says, “May it be to me], as the lamb”, “As the Temple pens”, “As the wood [on the altar]”, “As the fire [on the altar]”, “As the altar”, “As the Temple” or “As Jerusalem”; [or] if one vowed by reference to the altar utensils, even though he did not mention “korban”, behold this one was vowed by a korban. Rabbi Judah said: He who says “Jerusalem” has said nothing.

### michna 4
If one says “A korban”, “A wholly burnt-offering”, “A meal-offering”, “A sin-offering”, “A thanksgiving-offering”, “A peace-offering, should be that which I eat from you”   he is bound [by his vow]. Rabbi Judah permitted [him]. [If he says] “The korban”, “like a korban”, “korban”, should be that which I eat from you   he is bound [by his vow]. If he says, “That which I shall not eat of yours should be a korban”, Rabbi Meir forbids [him]. If one says to his fellow, “Konam be my mouth which speaks with you”, “My hands which work for you” [or] “My feet which walk with you,’ he is forbidden.
