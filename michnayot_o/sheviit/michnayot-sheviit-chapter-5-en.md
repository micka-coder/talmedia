White figs--their Sabbatical year is the second year [of the Sabbatical cycle], because it takes them three years to produce. Rabbi Yehuda says: Persian figs--their Sabbatical year is the year after the Sabbatical year, because it takes them two years to produce. They replied to him: They only stated [this rule] about white figs.

### michna 2
If one stores black calla lily in the ground during the Sabbatical year, Rabbi Meir says: He must store no less than two Se'ah [specific unit of volume], up to a height of three Tefachim, with one Tefach of earth on top of it. The Sages say: He must store no less than four Kabim [specific unit of volume], up to a height of one Tefach, with one Tefach of earth on top of it. One must store it in a place where people walk.

### michna 3
Black calla lily that has passed the Sabbatical year, Rabbi Eliezer says: If the poor have gathered its leaves, they have gathered [and nothing further is required]; but if not, one must reckon with the poor [and pay them for what grew during the Sabbatical year]. Rabbi Yehoshua says: If the poor have gathered its leaves, they have gathered; but if not, the poor are not owed a reckoning from him.

### michna 4
Black calla lily from the year before the Sabbatical that has entered the Sabbatical year, and so too for summer onions, and so too for madder, the house of Shammai say: one must uproot it with wooden rakes; whereas the house of Hillel say: [one may uproot it] with metal axes. Both agree about ribbed Rubia, that one may uproot it with metal axes.

### michna 5
From when may one buy black calla lily after the Sabbatical year? Rabbi Yehuda says: Immediately. But the Sages say: when the new [parts of leaves] exceed [the old].

### michna 6
These are the tools that a craftsman is not allowed to sell during the Sabbatical year: a plow and all its tools, a yoke, a winnowing fan, and a pick. However, one may sell a hand-sickle, a harvesting sickle, and a wagon and all its tools. This is the rule: anything whose usage is directed toward [work which is a Sabbatical] transgression is forbidden; but [anything the normal usage of which is for work which is] a transgression [on the Sabbatical year] or permitted, it is permitted.

### michna 7
The potter may sell five oil jugs and fifteen wine jugs, since it is common [for a buyer] to collect [such an amount] from ownerless [produce]. If one collects more, [selling more jugs is] permitted. He may sell [more jugs] to non-Jews in the land [of Israel] and to Jews outside of the land.

### michna 8
The house of Shammai say, one should not sell him [a Jew] a plowing cow during the Sabbatical year. The house of Hillel allow it, since he could slaughter it. One may sell him fruits even during planting time, and one may lend him his Se'ah measure even though one knows that he has a granary, and make change for him even though one knows he has laborers. And all of these [actions], if [he has expressed] explicit [intent], are forbidden.

### michna 9
A woman may lend to her fellow who is suspected in the matter of the Sabbatical year a sieve, a sifter, millstones and an oven. But she may not sort or grind with her. The wife of a Chaver [status marking those who scrupulously observe tithes and purity laws] may lend to the wife of an Am HaAretz [status marking those who are lax in observing tithes and purity laws] a sieve and a sifter, and may sort, grind and sift with her. But once she wets [the flour], she may not touch it, as one may not assist transgressors. And all of these were said only for the sake of peace. And we encourage the work of non-Jews in the Sabbatical year, but not that of Jews. And we inquire after their [the non-Jews] well-being, for the sake of peace.
