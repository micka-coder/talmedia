### michna 1
Originally it was said, one may collect sticks, stones and grasses from one's own field, just like one may collect from one's neighbor's field - the biggest items. Once transgressors multiplied, it was instituted that this one may [only] collect from that one's [field], while this one may collect [only] from that one's [field]; this mustn't be done as a favor, and it doesn't require mentioning that [one must not] stipulate to [give] them food [in exchange].

### michna 2
A field which had been de-thorned, may be planted during the eight year. A field which had been improved [by ploughing] or fertilized may not be planted during the eighth year. A field which had been improved: the house of Shammai says its fruit may not be eaten on the seventh year, while the house of Hillel says they may be eaten. The house of Shammai says the fruit of the seventh year may not be eaten while [expressing] gratitude [to the original owner], while the house of Hillel says they may be eaten either while [expressing] gratitude [to the original owner] or not. Rabbi Yehudah says, These opinions must be switched, for this is one of the examples of a leniency of the house of Shammai and a stringency of the house of Hillel.

### michna 3
One may rent a ploughed field in the Sabbatical year [to plant in the eight year] from a non-Jew, but not from a Jew. And we [verbally] encourage the work of non-Jews in the Sabbatical year, but not that of Jews. And we inquire after their [the non-Jews] well-being, for the sake of peace.

### michna 4
If one is thinning out olive trees, the house of Shamai say: he should chop [off the trunk but leave the roots]. The house of Hillel say: he may uproot. They admit that if one is creating a clearing, one must chop [it off]. What is considered thinning out? One or two. [What is considered] creating a clearing? Three side by side. To what does this apply? In one's own property; however in one's fellow's property -- even if one is creating a clearing, one may uproot.

### michna 5
One who split wood from an olive tree may not cover it with dirt. However, he may cover it with stones or straw. One who cuts the beam[-producing part]s of a sycamore tree may not cover it with dirt. However, he may cover it with stones or straw. One may not cut a virgin sycamore tree in the Sabbatical year, because it is work. Rabbi Yehudah says: In the normal manner [of cutting] it is forbidden, but [he may] either cut high [above the ground] ten-handbreadths or raze it to the ground.

### michna 6
One who is pruning grapes or cutting reeds - Rabbi Yosi the Galilean says, he should distance [his cutting] a handbreadth [from the ground]. Rabbi Akiva says, one may cut in a normal way, using a hatchet, sickle, saw, or whatever one wishes. If a tree split, one may bind it during the Sabbatical year; not in order to help it grow more, but rather that the split shouldn't widen.

### michna 7
From when may one eat fruits during the Sabbatical year? Unripe figs, once they redden, one may eat one's bread with them in the field. Once they start to ripen, one may gather them into one's house. And those similar to them [in stage of ripeness] during the other years [of the seven-year cycle] require tithes.

### michna 8
The unripe grape, once it exudes liquid [when squeezed], one may eat one's bread with it in the field. Once it begins to ripen, one may gather it into one's house. And those similar to them [in stage of ripeness] during the other years [of the seven-year cycle] require tithes.

### michna 9
Olives, once a Se'ah [of olives, specific unit of volume] can produce a Revi'it [of oil, specific unit of volume, quarter of a Log ], he may crack them and eat them in the field. When they can produce a half Log [specific unit of volume], he may crush [them] and rub on [the oil] in the field. When they can produce a third, he may crush [them] in the field and gather [them] into his house. And those similar to them [in stage of ripeness] during the other years [of the seven-year cycle] require tithes. And all the other fruit of the tree, just like their season for [requiring] tithes, so is their season for [consumption during] the Sabbatical year.

### michna 10
From when must one not cut down a [fruit] tree in the Sabbatical year? The house of Shammai says, any tree once it produces. The house of Hillel says, carobs - once they have formed a chain-like appearance; grapes - once they have formed globules; olives - once they have blossomed; other trees - once they have produced. And any tree, once it has reached its tithing season, may be cut down. How much must an olive tree produce that it can't be cut down? - a Rova [specific unit of volume]. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says, it depends on the particular olive tree.
