### michna 1
From when do we begin to mention the power of [bringing] rain [in the Shemoneh Esrai ], Rabbi Eliezer says, from the first day of the festival [Sukkot]. Rabbi Yehoshua says, from the last day of the festival [Sukkot]. Rabbi Yehoshua said to him [Rabbi Eliezer], since rain on the festival is nothing but a sign of a curse why should he mention it? Rabbi Eliezer said to him: I also did not say to request [rain] but to make mention, He causes the wind to blow and the rain to fall in its due season. He replied to him: if so one should at all times make mention of it.

### michna 2
We do not ask for rain, unless it is near [or during] the rains. Rabbi Yehudah says, "He who passes in front of the ark [the chazzan] on the last day of the festival [Shmini Atzeret], the last one [the chazzan who does the Musaf service] mentions [that G-d brings rain], but the first one [the one who does the Shacharit service] does not. On the first day of Passover, the first [chazzan] still mentions it, but the last one does not." Until when is the rain to be prayed for? Rabbi Yehudah says till after the Passover; Rabbi Meir says till the month of Nissan has passed, because it is said [Joel 2:23], "And he will cause to come down for you the rain, the early rain and the late rains in the first month."

### michna 3
On the third of Mar-Cheshvan prayers for the rain are to be said, but according to Rabbon Gamaliel, on the seventh of the same month, namely, fifteen days after the feast of tabernacles, in order that the last Israelites might have reached the river Euphrates.

### michna 4
If the seventeenth of Mar-Cheshvan has come without the rain having yet descended, private individuals commence to keep three fast-days. On the night beforehand, they are allowed to eat and drink, and it is allowed [on the fast day itself] to work, to bathe, to anoint the body, to wear [leather] shoes, and to perform the marriage duty.

### michna 5
If the new moon of Kislev has arrived without the rain having yet descended, the Beth Din (law court) shall order three public fast days. On the night beforehand, we may eat and drink, and it is allowed [on the fast day itself] to work to bathe, to anoint the body, to wear [leather] shoes, and to perform the marriage duty.

### michna 6
If these [fasts] have passed and were not [favorably] answered, the Beth Din shall decree three more public fasts. On the night beforehand, we may eat and drink, but [on the fast day itself] it is prohibited to work, to bathe, anoint the body, wear [leather] shoes, and to perform the marriage duty. Additionally, we lock the bathhouses. If these [fasts] have passed and were not [favorably] answered, the Beth Din shall decree seven more fast days, which altogether make thirteen public fasts. These are more [strict] than the earlier [fast days], because [on these new fasts] we cry out [with shofar or voice], and we lock the shops. On Mondays, towards the evening, the shop-shutters [of those who sell articles of food] may be [loosely] leaned on [that is, not fully closed, but in a slanting position, so as to discourage but not completely prohibit buying], and on Thursdays, they may be entirely taken off, in honor of the [approaching] Sabbath.

### michna 7
If these [fasts] have passed and were not [favorably] answered, we lessen from engaging in business transactions; from erecting buildings and planting; and from betrothings, weddings, and mutual greetings, like men who have been rebuked [and, so to speak, put] in their place. Private individuals return to fasting until the end of the month of Nissan. If Nissan has elapsed, and then the rain falls (some change the words to read "without rain," though not all. Due to the verse quoted, it seems that the phrase should be left out), it must be considered as a curse, for thus it is written [I Samuel 12:17], "Is it not wheat harvest to day? I will call unto the Lord, and he shall send thunder and rain (proving through context that rain during the harvest season is a curse)."
