### michna 1
If the blood of a hatat spurted on to a garment, it must be washed. Though scripture speaks only of [hatats] which are eaten, for it is said, “In the holy place shall it be eaten,” (Leviticus 6:19), yet both those which may be eaten and the inner [sacrifices] necessitate washing, for it is said, “[This is] the law of the hatat” (Leviticus 6:18), there is one law for all hatats.

### michna 2
The blood of a disqualified hatat does not necessitate washing, whether it had a period of fitness or did not have a period of fitness. Which had a period of fitness? One [whose blood] was kept overnight, or was defiled, or was taken out [of the Temple courtyard]. Which did not have a period of fitness? One which was slaughtered [with the intention of eating it] after the appropriate time or outside the appropriate bounds; or whose blood was received by unfit persons, and sprinkled by them.

### michna 3
If [blood] spurted [direct] from the [animal's] throat onto a garment, it does not require washing. From the horn or from the base [of the altar], it does not require washing. If it spilled out on to the floor [of the Temple] and [the priest] collected it, [and then it splattered onto a garment] it does not require washing. Only blood which was received in a vessel and is fit for sprinkling requires washing. If [the blood] spurted on to the hide, before it was flayed, it does not require washing. [If it spurted] after it was flayed, it requires washing, the words of Rabbi Judah. Rabbi Elazar says: even [if it spurted on the skin] after it was flayed [it does not require washing]. Only the place of the blood requires washing. And whatever is eligible to contract uncleanness, And whatever is fit for washing.

### michna 4
Whether a garment, a sack, or a hide, it requires washing in a holy place. The breaking of an earthen vessel must be in a holy place. And the scouring and rinsing of a copper vessel must be in a holy place. In this the hatat is more stringent than [other] sacrifices of higher sanctity.

### michna 5
If a garment was carried outside the curtains [of the Tabernacle], it must re-enter, and is washed it in the holy place. If it was defiled outside the curtains, one must tear it, then it re-enters, and is washed in the holy place. If an earthen vessel was carried outside the hangings, it re-enters and is broken in a holy place. If it was defiled outside the curtains, a hole is made in it, then it re-enters and is broken in a holy place.

### michna 6
If a copper vessel was carried outside the hangings, it re-enters and is scoured and rinsed in a holy place. If it was defiled outside the hangings, it must be broken through, then it re-enters and is scoured and rinsed in a holy place.

### michna 7
Whether one boiled in it or poured boiling [sacrificial flesh] into it, whether most sacred sacrifices or lesser sacrifices, [the pot] requires scouring and rinsing. Rabbi Shimon says: lesser sacrifices do not require scouring and rinsing. Rabbi Tarfon says: if one boiled [sacrifices in a pot] at the beginning of a festival, he can boil in it during the whole festival. But the sages say: until the time of eating, scouring and rinsing. Scouring is done as the scouring of a goblet; and rinsing is as the rinsing of a goblet, Scouring [in hot water] and rinsing in cold [water]. The spit and the grill are cleansed with hot water.

### michna 8
If one boiled sacrifices and hullin in it [the copper pot], or most holy sacrifices and lesser sacrifices, if they were sufficient to impart their flavor, the less stringent must be eaten as the more stringent of them; But they do not necessitate scouring and rinsing; And they do not disqualify by touch. If [an unfit] wafer touched a [fit] wafer, or an [unfit] piece of meat touched a [fit] piece of meat, not the whole wafer or the whole piece of meat is forbidden; only the part that absorbed [of the unfit] is forbidden.
