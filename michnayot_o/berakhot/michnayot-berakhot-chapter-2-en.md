### michna 1
If one was reading [_Shema_] in the Torah, and it came time to recite [_Shema_]: If he directed his mind [and intended to fulfill his obligation to recite _Shema_ as he read it], he has fulfilled his obligation. And if not, he has not fulfilled his obligation. At the breaks [between sections of _Shema_], one may greet another out of honor and return a greeting, and in the middle [of a section], one may greet out of fear and return a greeting. These are the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: In the middle, one may greet out of fear and return a greeting out of honor, and at the breaks, one may greet out of honor and return a greeting to any person.

### michna 2
These are the section breaks: Between the first and second blessings, between the second blessing and _Shema_, and between _Shema_ and _Vehayah im shamoa_ [second paragraph of the _Shema_], between _Vehayah im shamoa_ and _Vayomer_ [third paragraph of _Shema_], between _Vayomer_ and _Emet veyatsiv_ [blessing after _Shema_]. Rabbi Yehuda says: Between _Vayomer_ and _Emet veyatsiv_ -- one may not pause. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Karchah said: Why does _Shema_ precede _Vehayah im shamoa_? So that one may accept the yoke of the kingdom of heaven first, and after that accept the yoke of the commandments. And [why does] _Vehayah im shamoa_ [precede] _Vayomer_? Because _Vehayah im shamoa_ applies during the day and at night, and _Vayomer_ only applies during the day.

### michna 3
One who recites _Shema_ but doesn't make it audible to his ear - has fulfilled his obligation. Rabbi Yosei says: Has not fulfilled his obligation. One who recites but does not articulate each letter: Rabbi Yosei says: Has fulfilled his obligation. Rabbi Yehuda says: Has not fulfilled his obligation. One who recites out of order - has not fulfilled his obligation. One who recites and makes a mistake - should return to the place where he made the mistake.

### michna 4
Workers can recite [_Shema_] on top of a tree or on top of a wall of stones, which they are not permitted to do for [reciting the Shemoneh Esreh] prayer.

### michna 5
A groom is exempt from reciting _Shema_ on the first night, until Saturday night if he has not done the deed. A story about Rabban Gamliel who recited [_Shema_] on the first night that he got married. His students said to him: Didn't you teach us, our teacher, that a groom is exempt from reciting _Shema_ on the first night? He said to them: I will not listen to you, to remove the kingdom of heaven from me for even one hour.

### michna 6
[Rabban Gamliel] washed on the first night after his wife died. His students said to him: Didn't you teach us, our teacher, that a mourner is forbidden to wash? He said to them: I am not like other people. I am delicate.

### michna 7
And when [Rabban Gamliel's] slave Tavi died, he received words of comfort for him. His students said to him: Didn't you teach us, our teacher, that one does not receive words of comfort for slaves? He said to them: My servant Tavi was not like other servants. He was _Kasher_ [acceptable].

### michna 8
If a groom wants to recite _Shema_ on the first night, he may recite [it]. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Not everyone who wants to take on the [Divine] name may take it on.
