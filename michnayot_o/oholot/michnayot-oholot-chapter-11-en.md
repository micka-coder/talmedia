### michna 1
A house, which has been split [into two]: If there is uncleanness in the outer [part], vessels in the inner [part] remain clean. If the uncleanness is in the inner [part], vessels in the outer [are clean]: Bet Shammai says: when the split is four handbreadths wide; But Bet Hillel says: [when the split is of] any size. Rabbi Yose says in the name of Bet Hillel: [when it is] one handbreadth wide.

### michna 2
A portico which has been split [into two]: If there is uncleanness on the one side, vessels on the other side remain clean. If a person placed his leg or a reed above [the split],  he has combined [with the roof to bring the] uncleanness. If he placed the reed on the ground, it does not form a passage for the uncleanness until it is one handbreadth off the ground.

### michna 3
A thick woolen jacket or a thick wooden block does not bring uncleanness until they are one handbreadth high off the ground. If [garments] are folded one above the other they do not bring uncleanness until the uppermost is one handbreadth high off the ground. If a person were placed there [under the split in the portico]: Bet Shammai says: he does not bring the uncleanness. But Bet Hillel says: a person is hollow and his uppermost side brings the uncleanness.

### michna 4
If a person was looking out of a window and overshadowed a funeral procession: Bet Shammai says: he does not bring uncleanness. But Bet Hillel says: he does bring the uncleanness. They agree that if he was dressed in his clothes or if there were two persons, one above the other, they bring the uncleanness.

### michna 5
If a person was lying on the threshold and the funeral procession overshadowed him: Bet Shammai says: he does not bring the uncleanness. But Bet Hillel says: he does bring the uncleanness.

### michna 6
[In the case] where the uncleanness was in the house and clean persons overshadowed him: Bet Shammai declares them clean, But Bet Hillel declares them unclean.

### michna 7
A dog which had eaten the flesh of a corpse and then died   and was lying over the threshold:Rabbi Meir says: if its neck has a thickness of one handbreadth it can bring the uncleanness, but if not, it does not bring the uncleanness. Rabbi Yose says: we [examine to] see where the uncleanness is. If it is beneath the lintel and inwards, the house becomes unclean; if from the lintel and outwards, the house remains clean. Rabbi Eliezer says: if its mouth [points] inwards, the house remains clean; if its mouth [points] outwards, the house becomes unclean, since the uncleanness goes out through its hind. Rabbi Judah ben Batera says: in either case the house becomes unclean. How long can [the uncleanness] remain in its entrails? Three whole days. [If in the entrails] of fishes or birds, as long as [it takes for the uncleanness] to fall in the fire and be consumed, the words of Rabbi Shimon. Rabbi Judah ben Batera says: in the case of fishes or birds, twenty-four hours.

### michna 8
A cellar in a house with a candlestick in it, whose calyx protrudes and an olive-basket is placed such that if the candlestick was taken away the olive-basket would still remain over the mouth of the cellar: Bet Shammai says: the cellar remains clean but the candlestick becomes unclean. Bet Hillel says: the candlestick also remains clean. But they agree that if the olive-basket would fall [into the cellar] if the candlestick was removed, all would become unclean.

### michna 9
Vessels [that are] between the rims of the olive-basket and the rims of the cellar, even to the depths, remain clean. If there is uncleanness in the cellar, the house becomes unclean. If there is uncleanness in the house, vessels in the walls of the cellar   remain clean, if the place where they are has a content of one cubic handbreadth;   if not, they become unclean. If the walls of the cellar are wider [apart] than those of the house, in either case the vessels remain clean.
