### michna 1
If one was passing through the market and said, “Take for yourselves [from my] figs,” they may eat and be exempt [from tithes]. Therefore if they brought them into their houses, they must separate tithes as [one does for] certainly non-tithed [produce]. [If he said], “Take and bring it into your houses,” they may not eat casually from them. Therefore if they brought them into their houses, they do not need to separate tithes except as [one does for] Demai [produce from which it is uncertain if tithes were already taken].

### michna 2
If they were sitting at the gate or in a store and someone said, "Take for yourselves [from my] figs," they may eat and be exempt. But the owner of the gate or the owner of the store would be required. Rabbi Yehudah exempts him, unless he hides his face, or unless he changes the place where he is sitting.

### michna 3
If one brings produce from the Galilee to Judah or makes a pilgrimage [and brings produce] to Jerusalem, he may eat [of the produce] until he arrives at the place where he was going, and so too in returning. Rabbi Meir says, until he arrives at the place of stopping. And the merchants who peddle in the cities may eat until they arrive at the place of sleep. Rabbi Yehudah says, the first house [in the city where he will sleep should be considered as if] it is his house.

### michna 4
Produce from which he separated Terumah before their work was finished: Rabbi Eliezer forbids eating casually from them, but the Sages permit except when it is a basket of figs. A basket of figs from which he separated Terumah : Rabbi Shimon permits, but the Sages forbid.

### michna 5
One who says to his friend: “Here is this Issar [specific unit of money], and give me five figs for it”, he may not eat [of them] until he has tithed [them], the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehudah says: if he ate them one by one, he is exempt. If he combined them, he is required [to tithe.] Rabbi Yehudah said: it happened in a rose-garden that was in Jerusalem, and there were figs being sold three or four for an Issar, and neither Terumah nor tithes were ever set aside from it.

### michna 6
One who says to his friend: “Here is this Issar for ten figs that I will choose for myself,” he may choose and eat [the figs one at a time without tithing. If he said,] “For a cluster of grapes that I will choose for myself,” he may pick [grapes from the cluster] and eat [one at a time]. [If he said,] “For a pomegranate that I will choose for myself,” he may take apart [the pomegranate] and eat [it one piece at a time]. [If he said] “For a melon that I will choose for myself,” he may slice and eat [it one piece at a time]. But if he said “For these twenty figs,” or “For these two clusters,” or “For these two melons,” he may eat them in his usual way and be exempt [from tithes], because he bought them while they were still attached to the ground.

### michna 7
One who has hired a worker to dry figs with him, and [the worker] said to him, “On the condition that I may eat of the figs,” he may eat them and is exempt [from tithing]. [If he said,] “On the condition that my son and I may eat,” or “that my son may eat in lieu of my receiving a wage,” he eats and is exempt [from tithing what he eats], but his son eats and is required [to tithe]. [If he said,] “On the condition that I may eat of them during the harvest time and after the harvest time,” during the harvest time he eats and is exempt [from tithing], but after the harvest time he eats and is required [to tithe], since he does not eat of them in a manner mandated by the Torah. This is the general rule: one who eats in a manner mandated by the Torah is exempt [from tithing], and one who does not eat in the manner mandated by the Torah is required [to tithe].

### michna 8
If [a hired worker is] working among bad figs, he may not eat of white figs. If among white figs, he may not eat of bad figs, but must restrain himself until he reaches the place of the better figs, and [there] he may eat. If a man exchanges with his friend, either [figs] to be eaten for [figs] to be eaten, or [figs] to be dried for [figs] to be dried, or [figs] to be eaten for [figs] to be dried, then he is required [to give tithes]. Rabbi Yehudah says: one who exchanges for [figs] to be eaten is required, but [for figs] to be dried is exempt.
