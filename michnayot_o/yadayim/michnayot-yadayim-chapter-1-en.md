### michna 1
[A minimum of] a quarter [of a log] of water must be poured over the hands for one [person] and even for two. A minimum of half  a log must be poured over the hands for three or four persons. A minimum of one log [is sufficient] for five, ten, or one hundred persons. Rabbi Yose says: as long as there is not less than a quarter of a log left for the last person among them. More [water] may be added to the second water, but more may not be added to the first water.

### michna 2
Water may be poured over the hands out of any kind of vessel, even out of vessels made of animal dung, out of vessels made of stone or out of vessels made of clay. Water may not be poured from the sides of [broken] vessels or from the bottom of a ladle or from the stopper of a jar. Nor may one pour [water] over the hands of his fellow out of his cupped hands. Because one may not draw, nor sanctify, nor sprinkle the water of purification,   nor pour water over the hands except in a vessel. And only vessels closely covered with a lid protect [their contents from uncleanness]. And  only vessels protect [their contents from uncleanness] inside earthenware vessels.

### michna 3
Water which had become so unfit that it could not be drunk by a beast: If it was in a vessel it is invalid, But if it was in the ground  it is valid. If there fell into [the water], dye, or gum or sulphate of copper and its color changed, it is invalid. If a person did any work with it or soaked his bread in it, it is invalid. Shimon of Teman says: even if he intended to soak his bread in one water and it fell into another water the water is valid.

### michna 4
If he cleansed vessels with the water or scrubbed  measures with it, [the water] is invalid. If he rinsed with it vessels which had already been rinsed or new vessels, it is valid. Rabbi Yose declares [the water] invalid if they were new vessels.

### michna 5
Water in which the baker dips his loaves is invalid; But if he moistened his hands in the water it is valid. All are fit to pour water over the hands, even a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor. A person may place the jug between his knees and pour out the water Or he may turn the jug on its side and pour it out. A monkey may pour water over the hands. Rabbi Yose declares these [latter] two cases invalid.
