### michna 1
If a woman was eating terumah, and they came and said to her, “Your husband is dead”, or “He divorced you.” Or, if a slave was eating terumah, and they came and said to him: “Your master is dead”, or “He sold you to an Israelite”, or “He gave you away as a gift”, or “He emancipated you.” So too, if a priest was eating terumah and it became known that he was the son of a divorced woman or a halutzah (a woman released from levirate marriage): Rabbi Eliezer says: they must repay both the value and the fifth. But Rabbi Joshua exempts them [from the added fifth]. If [a priest] was standing and sacrificing on the altar and it became known that he was the son of a divorced woman or a halutzah: Rabbi Eliezer says: all the sacrifices he had offered on the altar are disqualified. But Rabbi Joshua pronounces them valid. If it, however, it became known that he possessed a blemish, his service is disqualified.

### michna 2
In all the above cases, if terumah was still in their mouth: Rabbi Eliezer says: they may swallow it. But Rabbi Joshua says: they must spit it out. [If it was said to him], “Your have become unclean”, or “the terumah has become unclean”, Rabbi Eliezer says: he may swallow it. But Rabbi Joshua says: he must spit it out. [If it was said to him], “You were unclean” or “the terumah was unclean”, or it became known that [the food he was eating] was untithed, or that it was first tithe from which terumah had not yet been taken, or second tithe or dedicated produce that had not been redeemed, or if he tasted the taste of a bug in his mouth, he must spit it out.

### michna 3
If he was eating a bunch of grapes, and he entered from the garden into the courtyard: Rabbi Eliezer says: he may finish eating. But Rabbi Joshua says: he may not finish. If dusk set in at the eve of Shabbat: Rabbi Eliezer says: he may finish eating. But Rabbi Joshua says: he may not finish.

### michna 4
If wine of terumah was left uncovered, it must be poured out, and there is no need to say this in the case of hullin. Three kinds of liquids are forbidden if they were left uncovered: water, wine and milk, but all other drinks are permitted. How long do they remain uncovered for them to become prohibited? The time it takes the snake to creep out from a place near by and drink.

### michna 5
The amount of water that is uncovered: enough to negate the poison. Rabbi Yose says: in vessels [it is forbidden] whatever the quantity, but for water on the ground, it must be forty se'ahs.

### michna 6
Figs, grapes, cucumbers, pumpkins, melons or watermelons that have bite marks, even if they are in a jar, both large or small, both plucked or still attached to the soil, they are forbidden as long as there is juice in them. [An animal] bitten by a snake is forbidden on account of the danger to life.

### michna 7
A wine-filter [used as a cover] does not prevent [the wine from becoming] forbidden by being uncovered. But Rabbi Nehemiah permits it.

### michna 8
A jar of terumah which may have become impure:Rabbi Eliezer says: if it had been deposited in an exposed place, he must now place it in a hidden place; and if it had formerly been uncovered, it must now be covered. But Rabbi Joshua says: if it had been in a hidden place, he must now place it in an exposed place; and if it had formerly been covered up, he must now uncover it. Rabban Gamaliel says: let him not do anything new to it.

### michna 9
A jar [of terumah] was broken in the upper part of the wine-press, and the lower part was unclean: Both Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua agree that if one can save at least a reviit of it in cleanness he should save it. But if not: Rabbi Eliezer says: let it flow down and become unclean of its own accord, and let him not make it unclean with his own hands.

### michna 10
Similarly a jar of [terumah] oil which spilled: Both Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua agree that if he can save at least a reviit in purity he should save it; But if not: Rabbi Eliezer says: let it flow down and be swallowed up by the ground, and let him not make it unclean with his own hands.

### michna 11
Concerning both cases Rabbi Joshua said: This is not the kind of terumah over which I am cautioned lest I defile it, but rather to eat of it and not to defile it. If one was passing from place to place with loaves of terumah in his hand and a Gentile said to him: “Give me one of these and I will make it unclean; for if not, I will defile them all,” let him defile them all, and not give him deliberately one to defile, the words of Rabbi Eliezer. But Rabbi Joshua says: he should place one of them on a rock.

### michna 12
Similarly, if gentiles say to women, “Give us one of you that we may defile her, and if not, we will defile you all”, then let them all be defiled rather than hand over to them one soul from Israel.

### michna 1
If a woman was eating Terumah [produce consecrated for priestly consumption] and someone came and told her, "your husband died," or "[he] divorced you," and also if a slave was eating Terumah and someone came and told him, "your master has died," or "[he] sold you to an Israelite [non-priest, whose slaves may not eat Terumah ]," or "[he] gave you as a gift," or "[he] made you a freeman," and also if a Kohen [priest] was eating Terumah and it became known that he is [not eligible to eat Terumah because he is] the son of a divorcee or of a Chalutzah [a childless widow whose brother-in-law has performed a divorce ceremony so as not to fulfill his requirement of marrying her], Rabbi Eliezer obligates him to pay the principle value and the fifth. Rabbi Yehoshua exempts him. If he was standing and sacrificing on the altar, and it became known that he is the son of a divorcee or a Chalutzah, Rabbi Eliezer says all the sacrifices that he offered on the altar are invalid. Rabbi Yehoshua deems them valid. If, [alternatively], it became known that he possesses a physical defect, his offering is invalid.

### michna 2
And in all of these cases, if there was Terumah in their mouths, Rabbi Eliezer says they may swallow [it]. Rabbi Yehoshua says they must spit [it] out. If someone tells him, "you have just become impure and the Terumah has just become impure," Rabbi Eliezer says he may swallow [it]. Rabbi Yehoshua says he must spit [it] out. [If someone tells him,] "you were already impure and the Terumah was already impure," or if it became known that it is untithed produce or Ma'aser Rishon [first tithe, which must be given to the Levite] from which no Terumah [produce consecrated for priestly consumption] was taken, or Ma'aser Sheni [second tithe, which must be eaten in Jerusalem] or Hekdesh [consecrated donation] that were not redeemed, or if he tasted the taste of an insect in his mouth, he must spit out [the Terumah ].

### michna 3
If someone was eating a grape cluster and entered from the garden into the courtyard, Rabbi Eliezer says he may finish [the cluster]. Rabbi Yehoshua says he may not finish. If Shabbat evening darkens [while he is eating], Rabbi Yehoshua says he may finish. Rabbi Eliezer says he may not finish.

### michna 4
If wine that is Terumah is left uncovered, it must be poured out. It is not necessary to say this if it is Chulin [non-sacred produce]. Three kinds of liquids become forbidden if left uncovered: water, wine, and milk. All other liquids [even if left uncovered] are permitted. How long must they be left [uncovered] for them to become forbidden? As long as [it would take] for a snake to come out from a nearby place and drink [from it].

### michna 5
The amount of water that may be left uncovered [without being rendered forbidden] is [greater than or equal to] the amount that can neutralize in it the poison. Rabbi Yosi says, in vessels, all [quantities of water are forbidden], and in the ground, forty Se'ah [specific unit of volume, is the minimum quantity of water that may be left uncovered and still be permitted].

### michna 6
Bite marks in figs, grapes, cucumbers, pumpkins, melons or cucumber-melons, even if they [the fruit] are as [much as] a Kikar, either large or small, either uprooted or rooted, all that contain moisture are forbidden. [An animal] bitten by a snake is forbidden on account of the danger to life.

### michna 7
A filter [used as a cover] for wine, [the wine] becomes forbidden if left uncovered. Rabbi Nekhemiah permits it.

### michna 8
A vessel of Terumah that has developed in it a chance that it is impure: Rabbi Eliezer says, if it had been deposited in a neglected place, one should deposit it in a hidden place; and if it was uncovered, one should cover it. Rabbi Yehoshua says, if it had been deposited in a hidden place, one should deposit it in a neglected place; and if it was covered, one should uncover it. Rabban Gamliel says, one should not do anything new to it.

### michna 9
A vessel [of Terumah ] that was broken in the upper vat [of a wine-press], and the lower vat was impure: Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua agree that if one can save at least a Revi'it [specific unit of volume] of it in purity, one should save it. But if not: Rabbi Eliezer says: let it flow down and become impure [of its own accord], and let him not defile it with his own hands.

### michna 10
Similarly, a vessel of [ Terumah ] oil that spilled: Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua agree that if one can save at least a Revi'it of it in purity, one should save it. But if not: Rabbi Eliezer says: let it flow down and be absorbed, and let him not absorb it with his own hands.

### michna 11
Concerning [both] this case and that case, Rabbi Yehoshua said: This is not [the kind of] Terumah over which I am cautioned from defiling it, but rather from eating it. And "Do not defile it" applies in what case? If one was passing from place to place with loaves of Terumah in his hand and a non-Jew said to him: “Give me one of these and I will defile it; for if not, I will defile them all.” Rabbi Eliezer says, let him defile them all, and do not give him one of them to defile. But Rabbi Yehoshua says: he should place before him one of them on a rock.

### michna 12
Similarly, women who have been told by non-Jews, “Give us one of you that we may defile her; for if not, we will defile you all,” let [the non-Jews] defile them all, and do not hand over to them one soul from Israel.
