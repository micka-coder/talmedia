### michna 1
They may not give terumah from pure [produce] for impure [produce], but if they did give, the terumah is terumah. In truth they said: If a cake of pressed figs had become partly defiled, one may give terumah from the clean part for that part which had become defiled. The same applies to a bunch of vegetables, or a stack of grain. If there were two cakes [of figs], two bunches [of vegetables], two stacks [of grain], one pure and one impure, one should not give terumah from one for the other. Rabbi Eliezer says: one can give terumah from that which is pure for that which is impure.

### michna 2
They may not give terumah from impure [produce] for that which is pure. If he did give: If unwittingly, the terumah is valid; If intentionally he has done nothing. So too, if a Levite had [unclean] tithe [from which terumah] had not been given, and he gave terumah from this, if unwittingly, the terumah is valid, if intentionally he has done nothing. Rabbi Judah says: if he knew of it at the outset, even if done in error, he has done nothing.

### michna 3
One who immerses [unclean] vessels on Shabbat: If unwittingly, he may use them. But if intentionally, he may not use them. One who separates tithes, or cooks on Shabbat: If unwittingly, he may eat it. But if intentionally, he may not eat it. One who plants on Shabbat: If unwittingly, he may keep the tree. But if intentionally, he must uproot it. But if during the sabbatical year, whether [it was planted] unwittingly or intentionally he must uproot it.

### michna 4
They may not give terumah from one kind for another kind, and if he did give, the terumah is not terumah. All kinds of wheat count as one. All kinds of fresh figs, dried figs and fig cakes count as one, and he may take terumah from one for the other. Wherever there is a priest, one must give terumah from the very best, and where there is no priest, one must give terumah from that which lasts longest. Rabbi Judah says: he should always give only from the very best.

### michna 5
They should give terumah of a whole small onion, and not of half of a large onion. Rabbi Judah says: not so, rather half of a large onion. So too, Rabbi Judah says: they give terumah from town onions for those from the village, but not from village onions for those from the town, since these are the food of its principal citizens.

### michna 6
They may give terumah from olives [to be used] for oil for those to be preserved, but not from olives due to be preserved for olives [to be used] for oil. [They may give] from unboiled wine for boiled wine, but not from boiled wine for unboiled wine. This is the general rule: any two things which together are kilayim (mixed species) he should not give terumah from one for the other, even if one is superior and the other inferior. But if they are not kilayim, then one may give terumah from the superior for that which is inferior, but not from the inferior for that which is superior. If one does give terumah from the inferior for that which is superior, his terumah is terumah, except for zunin given for wheat, since these (zunin) are not food. Cucumbers and melon count are one kind. Rabbi Judah says: two kinds.

### michna 1
One may not set aside Terumah [produce set aside for priestly consumption] from the pure for the impure. And if they set the Terumah aside, their Terumah is [valid] Terumah. Truly they said, the fig round, some of which has been made impure, one may set aside Terumah from the pure that is in it for the impure that is in it. And so too with a bundle of greenery, and so too with a pile. If there were two rounds, two bundles, or two piles--one impure and one pure--one may not set aside Terumah from one for the other. Rabbi Eliezer says: one may set aside Terumah from the pure for the impure.

### michna 2
One may not set aside Terumah from the impure for the pure. And if he accidentally set the Terumah aside, their Terumah is [valid] Terumah. If intentionally, [it is as if] he has done nothing. And so too with a Levite who had tithes from which Terumah had not been taken, and was continuously designating [parts of these impure tithes as the Terumah of other tithes]: if accidentally, what he did is done [with validity]. If intentionally, [it is as if] he has done nothing. Rabbi Yehudah said, if he knew that it was [impure] in the beginning, even if he [forgot and designated] accidentally, [it is as if] he has done nothing.

### michna 3
One who immerses vessels on the Sabbath accidentally may use them. Intentionally - he may not use them. One who tithes or cooks on the Sabbath accidentally may eat of it. Intentionally - he may not eat of it. One who plants on the Sabbath accidentally may allow it to grow. Intentionally - he must uproot [the plant]. If it is during the Sabbatical year, whether it was accidental or intentional - he must uproot.

### michna 4
One may not set aside Terumah from one species for a different species. And if he set the Terumah aside, his Terumah is not [valid] Terumah. All species of wheat are [considered] one [species]. All species of figs and dried figs and pressed figs are one, and one may set aside Terumah from one for the other. Any place where there is a Kohen [member of priestly caste], the Terumah should be set aside from the finer species. And any place where there is not a Kohen, the Terumah should be set aside from the longer lasting species. Rabbi Yehudah said, he should always set the Terumah aside from the finer species.

### michna 5
One should set aside as Terumah a whole small onion, rather than half of a large onion. Rabbi Yehudah said: not so, rather half of a large onion. And thus did Rabbi Yehudah say, one should set aside as Terumah onions from within the towns for [onions from within] the villages, but not [onions] from within the villages for [onions from within] the towns, because it is the food of the aristocracy.

### michna 6
One should set aside Terumah oil olives for pickled olives but not pickled olives for oil olives, and unboiled wine for boiled wine but not boiled wine for unboiled wine. The rule is that for any species that is considered Kilayim [forbidden mix of two species] with another species, one should not set aside Terumah from one [species] for the other [species], even from the good [species] for the bad [species]. And any species that is not considered Kilayim with another species, one may set aside Terumah from the good [species] for the bad [species], but not from the bad [species] for the good [species]. But if one set aside Terumah from the bad for the good, his Terumah is valid Terumah, except for from darnel [a poisonous rye grass] for wheat, since [darnel] is not a food. The gourd and the cucumber are one species. Rabbi Yehudah says [they are] two species.
