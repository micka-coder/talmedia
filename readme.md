# Talmedia data repository

Welcome to the Talmedia file repository. 

Talmedia is a collaborative project to translate classical Jewish texts into French. The texts can be consulted on our website (app.talmedia.org) or through the mobile application of the same name (currently available for Android, iOS device owners can use the web application which is a PWA).

For more details: www.talmedia.org

You can contribute to the translation and correction of the files by forking and editing on this repository.
