### michna 14
When do these rules apply? When [the hive retains the status of] a vessel.

### michna 15
A coffin which is broad below and narrow above, and has a corpse within it: A person touching it below remains clean; But above becomes unclean. If it is broad above and narrow below, a person touching it anywhere becomes unclean. If it was the same [above and below], a person touching it anywhere becomes unclean, the words of Rabbi Eliezer. But Rabbi Joshua says: a handbreadth and more below is clean, but from that handbreadth upwards is unclean. If it was made like a clothes-chest, a person touching it anywhere becomes unclean. If it was made like a case, a person touching it anywhere remains clean, except at the place where it opens.

### michna 16
A jar resting on its bottom in the open air: If an olive-sized [portion] of a corpse is placed beneath it or within it directly [above] its bottom, the uncleanness cleaves upwards and downwards, and the jar becomes unclean. [If the uncleanness is] outside below a [protruding] side, the uncleanness cleaves upwards and downwards, but the jar remains clean. [If the uncleanness is] within [the jar] and underneath the protruding sides, If there is within the [cavity of] the side a space of a cubic handbreadth everything [within the cavity] becomes unclean, but what lies directly [below] the mouth remains clean. If there is not [a space of a cubic handbreadth] the uncleanness cleaves upwards and downwards. When do these rules apply? When the jar is clean. If it was unclean, or if it was one handbreadth high off the ground,   or covered,   or inverted [so as to stand] on its mouth, if there is uncleanness beneath it, within it or above it, everything becomes unclean.
