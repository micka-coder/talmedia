### michna 1
A projection brings uncleanness, whatever width it may be; But a balcony or rounded balcony when they are one handbreadth wide. What is a projection? That [projection] whose surface slopes downwards, And a balcony's surface slopes upwards. In what [circumstances] did they say that a projection brings uncleanness whatever width it may be? With regard to a projection which is three rows of stones, or twelve handbreadths, above the doorway. When higher than that, it brings uncleanness only if it is one handbreadth wide. Cornices  and carvings bring uncleanness when they are one handbreadth wide.

### michna 2
A projection that is above a doorway forms a passage for the uncleanness when it is one handbreadth wide; If above a window two fingerbreadths high or the size of a hole made by a drill, when of any width whatsoever. Rabbi Yose says: when of equal size [to the particular window].

### michna 3
A rod above a doorway, even if one hundred cubits higher,  forms a passage for the uncleanness no matter its width, the words of Rabbi Joshua. Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri says: don't be more stringent than the case of a projection.

### michna 4
[In the case of] a projection which goes all round the house, occupying space above the doorway to the extent of three fingerbreadths, if there is uncleanness in the house, vessels beneath [the projection] become unclean. If the uncleanness is beneath [the projection]: Rabbi Eliezer declares the house unclean, But Rabbi Joshua declares it clean. A similar [rule applies] to a courtyard surrounded by a portico.

### michna 5
[With regard to] two projections, one [directly] above the other, each having a width of one handbreadth and a space of one handbreadth between them: If there is uncleanness beneath them, what is beneath them becomes unclean; If it is between them, what is between them becomes unclean; Above them, everything directly [above] to the sky becomes unclean. If the upper [projection] overlapped the lower to the extent of one handbreadth: If there is uncleanness beneath or between them, what is beneath and between them becomes unclean; If it is above them, what is directly [above] to the sky becomes unclean. If the upper [projection] overlapped the lower to an extent of less than a handbreadth: If there is uncleanness beneath them, what is beneath and between them becomes unclean; If it is between them or beneath the overlapping [part]: Rabbi Eliezer says: what is beneath them and between them becomes unclean. Rabbi Joshua says: what is between them and beneath the overlapping [part] becomes unclean, but what is beneath [the lower one] remains clean.

### michna 6
If they had a width of a handbreadth but there was not a space of a handbreadth between them: If there is uncleanness beneath them, what is beneath becomes unclean; If it is between them or above them, everything directly [above] to the sky becomes unclean.

### michna 7
If they did not have a width of a handbreadth, whether there is a space of a handbreadth between them or whether there is not, if there is uncleanness beneath, between or above them, the uncleanness cleaves upwards and downwards. A similar [rule applies] to two curtains, [the lower one of which is] one handbreadth high off the ground.
