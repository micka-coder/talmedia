### michna 1
[One] should not stand up to pray unless he is in a serious frame of mind. The original pious ones used to wait one hour and then pray, in order to direct their hearts towards the Omnipresent. [While one is reciting _Shemoneh Esrei_,] even if the king greets him, he should not respond to him, and even if a snake wraps around his heel, he should not interrupt.

### michna 2
[We] mention the request for rain in [the blessing of] _Techiyat HaMeitim_ [Resurrection of the Dead]; and [we] ask for rain [by adding the phrase _Vetein Tal Umatar Livrakhah_] in _Birkat HaShanim_ [Blessing of the Year's crops]; and [we recite] _Havdalah_ [blessing for the transition from Sabbath to weekday] in [the blessing of] _Chonein Hada'at_ [Endower of Knowledge]. Rabbi Akiva says: One recites it [_Havdalah_] as a fourth blessing by itself. Rabbi Eliezer says: [One recites _Havdalah_] in the blessing of _Modim_ [Thanksgiving].

### michna 3
One who says [in prayer]:  "To the nest of a bird does Your compassion reach!" and "On the good shall Your Name be mentioned!" "Thank you, thank you"--silence him. One who leads the prayer service and makes a mistake--replace him with another. And he [who is asked to serve as the replacement] should not refuse at such a time. From where should [the replacing leader] begin? From the beginning of the blessing in which [the first leader] made a mistake.

### michna 4
One who leads the prayers should not repond after [the blessing of] the _Kohanim_ [by saying] "Amen", because of the lost concentration [that might ensue]. If there is no _Kohen_ there besides him [to recite the Priestly Blessing], He should not recite the Priestly Blessing [himself]. But if he is confident that he will [be able to] recite the Priestly Blessing and [then] return to his prayer, [he is] permitted.

### michna 5
One who is praying, and makes a mistake, it is a bad omen for him; and if he was a delegate of the congregation, it is a bad omen for his delegators [the congregation], because a person's messenger is [considered] like himself. They used to say about him, about Rabbi Chanina ben Dosa: When he would pray for the sick, he would say: This one will live and this one will die. They said to him: How do you know? He replied to them: If the prayer is fluent in my mouth, I know that it has been accepted; and if not, then I know that it has been torn up.
