### michna 1
One whose dead lies before him, he is exempt from reciting the _Shema_, from saying _Shemoneh Esrei_ and from wearing tefillin.  The pall bearers and their replacements and the replacements of the replacements, regardless of whether they are in the front or in the back of the casket: those that are needed to carry the casket are exempt, and those that are not needed to carry the casket are obligated [to recite _Shema_].  These and those are exempt from reciting _Shemoneh Esrei_.

### michna 2
When they have buried the dead and returned: If they are able to start and to finish before they reach the [place where they stand in a] line, they should start. If not, they should not start.  As for those standing in a line, the ones standing on the inside are exempt and the ones standing on the outside are obligated.

### michna 3
Women, slaves, and minors are exempt from reciting _Shema_ and from tefillin and are obligated in [reciting] _Shemoneh Esrei_ and in [affixing a] _Mezuzah_ and in [reciting] _Birkat HaMazon_.

### michna 4
A _Ba'al Keri_ [someone subject to a certain form of ritual impurity] should recite _Shema_ in his mind and should not bless [its blessings whatsoever], not before and not after it. And on food he should bless after it and not bless before it. Rabbi Yehudah says: He should bless before and after them [_Shema_ and food].

### michna 5
If he was standing in prayer and remembered that he is a _Ba'al Keri_, he should not stop, but rather abridge [the prayer].  If he went down to immerse [himself], if he is able to go up and to cover himself and to recite [_Shema_] before and do it before sunrise, he should go up and cover himself and recite. And if not, he should cover himself in water and recite. But he should not cover himself in foul waters and not in waters of soaking [flax] until he puts [more] water into them. And how far must he distance himself from them and from excrement? Four cubits.

### michna 6
A _Zav_ [someone subject to a certain form of ritual impurity] who saw a seminal emission, and a _Niddah_ [someone subject to a different form of ritual impurity] who discharged semen from sexual relations, and a woman having sexual relations who saw menstrual blood, require [ritual] immersion. And Rabbi Yehudah exempts them.
