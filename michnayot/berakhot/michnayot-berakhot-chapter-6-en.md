### michna 1
How does one recite blessings for fruits?  On fruits growing on a tree, one says, "...Who created the fruit of the tree," except for wine; on wine, one says, "...Who created the fruit of the vine."  On fruits growing from the earth, one says, "...Who created the fruit of the ground," except for bread; on bread, one says, "...Who brings forth bread from the earth."  On vegetables, one says, "...Who created the fruit of the ground." Rabbi Yehudah says: [One should say instead,] "...Who created various types of herbs."

### michna 2
If one blessed on the fruits of the tree with "...Who created the fruit of the ground", he fulfilled his obligation. But if he blessed on the fruits of the ground "...Who created the fruit of the trees," he did not fulfill his obligation. In all [cases], if he said: "...For everything exists by God's word", he fulfilled his obligation.

### michna 3
On a thing which does not grow from the earth, say: "For everything." On vinegar and on unripe fruits and on the locusts, say: "For everything." On milk and on cheese and on eggs, say: "For everything." Rabbi Yehudah says: Anything which is a cursed species should not be blessed upon.

### michna 4
If one has before him many different species, Rabbi Yehudah says: If there is among them one of the seven species, bless on that one. But the Sages say: Bless on whichever he desires.

### michna 5
[If one] blessed on the wine before the meal – [he has] exempted the wine after the meal. [If one] blessed on the appetizer before the meal – [he has] exempted the dessert after the meal. [If one] blessed on the bread – [he has] exempted the appetizer; [but if one blessed] on the appetizer – [he has] not exempted the bread. The House of Shammai says: not even a cooked grain dish.

### michna 6
[If people] sit to eat – each one blesses for himself. [But if they] recline – one blesses for all. [If] wine comes in during the meal – each one blesses for himself. After the meal – one blesses for all. And he says it on incense even though incense is not brought until after the meal.

### michna 7
[If] they brought before him salty food first, and bread with it -- he blesses on the salty food and is exempt on the bread, because the bread is ancillary to it.  This is the principle: Everything that is primary, and has something secondary with it, he blesses on the primary and [thereby] exempts the secondary.

### michna 8
One who ate figs, grapes, or pomegranates, blesses three blessings after them [according to the] words of Rabban Gamliel. The Sages say, one blessing that is the essence of three. Rabbi Akiva says, even one who ate vegetables, if that was his food, blesses three blessings after it. One who is drinking water for his thirst says, “that everything exists by His word.” Rabbi Tarphon says, "Who creates many living beings."
