### michna 1
One may eat incidentally from the dough before it is rolled, in the case of wheat flour, or before it was mixed into a cohesive unit, in the case of barley flour. Once one has rolled wheat flour, or mixed barley flour into a cohesive dough, one who eats from it is liable for death [for eating Priestly food]. As soon as she puts in water, she should separate the Challah, provided that there is not [the minimum quantity of] five quarters of a Kav [specific unit of volume] of flour there.

### michna 2
If her dough became Meduma [mixture of Chulin (permitted foodstuff) and Terumah (a portion of a crop given to a Kohen) that is forbidden to non- Kohanim ], before she rolls it, it is exempt from Challah, as Meduma is exempt; after she rolled it, it is obligated. If there was a doubt [concerning purity] before she mixed, it may be completed while she is in a state of impurity; after she rolled it, however, it must be completed in a state of purity.

### michna 3
If she consecrated [to the Temple] her dough before rolling it, and then redeemed it [value onto a consecrated coin], it is obligated [in Challah ]. If she consecrated after rolling it, and redeemed it, it is also obligated. But if she consecrated it before rolling it, and the [Temple] treasurer finished the rolling, and then she redeemed it, [the dough is] exempt, as at the time the obligation took effect, it was exempt.

### michna 4
Similarly, if one consecrated their produce before the point of obligation Ma'aserot [tithes] took effect, and redeems it, it is obligated in Ma'aserot ; and if one redeemed after it had reached the point of obligation for Ma'aserot, it is obligated in Ma'aserot. But if one consecrated it before [the point of obligation in Ma'aserot ], and the [Temple] treasurer completed it, and then the owner redeemed it, it is exempt, as at the time the obligation took effect, it was exempt.

### michna 5
If a non-Jew gave [flour] to a Jew to make dough for him, it is exempt from Challah ; If he gave it to him as a gift: if before rolling the dough, it is obligated; but if after rolling it, it is exempt. If one makes dough together with a gentile, and if the Jew's share is not [at minimum] the minimum for Challah, the dough is exempt from [taking] Challah.

### michna 6
A convert who converted to Judaism and had dough: if the dough was made before he converted, it is exempt; after he converted, it is obligated. If he is in doubt [whether he mixed the dough before or after his conversion], it is obligated and [a non- Kohen who accidentally ate this Challah ] is not obligated for paying the extra fifth [to the Kohen ]. Rabbi Akiva says, it all depends on [the time of] the formation of a light crust in the oven.

### michna 7
If one makes dough from a mixture of wheat and rice, and the dough has the taste of the grain, it is obligated in Challah, and a person may use it to fulfill one's obligation [of Matsah [unleavened bread] on Passover. But if it does not have the taste of the grain, it is not obligated in Challah, nor may a person use it to fulfill one's obligation on Passover.

### michna 8
One who takes leaven out of dough from which Challah had not been removed and puts it into dough from which Challah had been removed: if one has a supply [of dough] from another place, one can take out [ Challah ] in accordance with the precise amount; but if one does not, one takes out one [portion of] Challah for the whole [dough].

### michna 9
Similarly, if olives of [regular] harvesting that became mixed with olives [left over] for striking-off [by the poor, that are exempt from Ma'aserot ], or grapes of [regular] gathering, with grapes [left over] for gleaning [by the poor]: if one has a supply from another place, one can take out [the necessary tithes] in accordance with the precise amounts. But if one does not [have a supply from another place], one takes out Terumah and Terumat Ma'aser [a tenth of the tithe given to a Levi which must, in turn, be given to a Kohen] for all of them. And as for the rest, [one takes out] Ma'aser [ Rishon, the first tithe of produce, which must be given to the Levi] and Ma'aser Sheni [the second tithe of produce, which must be taken to Jerusalem and consumed there] in accordance with the precise amount.

### michna 10
One who takes leaven from dough of wheat [flour] and puts it into dough of rice [flour]: if it has the taste of grain, it is obligated in Challah ; if not, it is exempt. If so, why did they say: “Untithed produce of any amount renders food prohibited”? That is [with regard to a mixture of] a kind with its own kind, but [with regard to a mixture of a kind] not with its own kind, [rather] only when it imparts taste.
