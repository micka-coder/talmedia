### michna 1
If three people eat together they are obligated to convene [to say the blessing after a meal]. If he ate food which may not have been tithed, or the first tithe from which _Terumah_ [produce consecrated for priestly consumption] had been removed, or the second tithe or _Hekdesh_ [items pledged for sacred use] that had been redeemed, or a servant that had eaten an olive['s volume], or a _Kuti_ [sect closely tied to Judaism], he must convene with them.  But if he ate untithed produce, or the first tithe from which _Terumah_ had not been removed, or the second tithe or sanctified [food] which had not been redeemed, or a servant who ate less than an olive['s volume], or a non-Jew, he cannot convene with them.

### michna 2
Women, slaves, and children--one cannot convene with them. How much is needed [to be eaten in order] to convene? At least an olive['s volume]. Rabbi Yehuda says at least an egg['s volume].

### michna 3
How does one convene?  When there are three [people] say, “Let us bless.” When there are three and him say, “Bless.” When there are ten say, “Let us bless our God.” When there are ten and him say, “Bless”. The [law is the] same for ten as for ten myriads. When there are a hundred say, “Let us bless.” When there are a hundred and him say, “Bless.” When there are a thousand say, “Let us bless God, our God, God of Israel.” When there are a thousand and him say, “Bless”. When there are ten thousand say, “Let us bless God, our God, God of Israel, God of the legions, who dwells above the _Keruvim_ [sculpted creatures that stood above the Ark], for the food that we have eaten.” With ten thousand and himself say, "Bless."  Like the way he blessed, they respond after him, “Blessed is God, our God, God of Israel, God of the legions, who dwells above the _Keruvim_, for the food that we have eaten.”  Rabbi Yosi the Galilean says, according to the greatness of the assembly they bless, as it says, ‘In assemblies bless God from the fountain of Israel.’ Said Rabbi Akiva, what do we find in the synagogue? The [law is the] same for many as for few; say "Bless God."  Rabbi Yishmael says, "Bless God, the blessed."

### michna 4
Three that eat together are not allowed to separate, and so [if there are] four, and so [if there are] five. Six may be separated until ten, and ten may not be separated until [there are at least] twenty.

### michna 5
When two groups eat together in one house, at a time when some of them see each other they may join to convene, and if not, these convene to themselves and those convene to themselves. The blessing over wine cannot be said until one adds water to it. These are the words of Rabbi Eliezer, and the Sages say they can bless.
