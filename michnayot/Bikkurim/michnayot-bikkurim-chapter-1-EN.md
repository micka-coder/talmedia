### michna 1
Some bring Bikkurim [first-fruits that must be brought to the Temple in Jerusalem and given to the Kohen, priest] and recite [the accompanying Biblical passage], some bring but do not recite, and some do not bring. These are who do not bring: one who plants in ones's own property but [the tree] leans into [another's] private or public property, and similarly, if [the tree] leans from a private or public property into one's own property. One who plants in one's own property and there are private or public roads that are planted in the middle does not bring. Rabbi Judah says, in that case, one does bring.

### michna 2
For what reason does one not bring? For it says (Exodus 23:19), "The first fruits of your land" [implying], all that is grown must be entirely from your land. Sharecroppers, renters, sikrikon [violent individuals who acquired fields and houses by use or threat of force, including murder], and thieves do not bring for the same reason, for it says, "The first fruits of your land."

### michna 3
One only brings Bikkurim from the seven species [special to the Land of Israel, listed in Deut. 8:8], [but] not from the dates of the mountains or from fruits of the valley, nor from oil-olives that are not of the highest quality. One does not bring Bikkurim before Atseret [Shavuot, the harvest festival]. People from Har Tsevo'im brought their Bikkurim before Atseret and they [the priests] did not accept [the fruits] because of the verse in the Torah, (Exodus 23:16) "And the harvest festival, the first fruits of your labor that you plant in the field."

### michna 4
These people bring, but do not recite: the convert brings but does not recite, for he is unable to say [in the Biblical recitation] "[the land] that God swore to our fathers to give to us." And if his mother was from Israel, he brings and recites. And when he prays by himself, he says [in place of, "the God of our fathers"] "the God of the fathers of Israel." And when he is in the synagogue, he says "the God of your fathers." And if his mother was from Israel, he says "the God of our fathers."

### michna 5
Rabbi Eli'ezer ben Ya'akov says, a woman who is the daughter of converts cannot marry into the Kohen class, unless her mother is an Israelite; [this ruling applies to] both converts and freed slaves, and even after ten generations [from the original convert/freed slave], until their mother is an Israelite. A trustee of an estate, an agent, a slave, a woman, a Tumtum [person with recessed sexual organs whose gender is therefore impossible to determine, presently, by external examination. It is halachically uncertain whether such a person is male or female] and an Androginos [person with both male and female sexual organs. It is halachically uncertain whether such a person is male, female or, perhaps, has a uniquely defined halachic gender.] all bring but do not recite, since they cannot say, "[the land] that You, God, have given me."

### michna 6
One who buys two trees in [the field] of a fellow, brings but does not recite. Rabbi Meir says, one brings and recites. If the spring dried or the tree was chopped, one brings but does not recite. Rabbi Judah says, one brings and recites. From Atseret until Sukkot, one brings and recites. From Sukkot until Hanukkah, one brings but does not recite. Rabbi Judah ben Beteira says, one brings and recites.

### michna 7
One who designated one's Bikkurim and [subsequently] sold one's field, brings and does not recite. And the second [one who bought the field] does not bring more from that same species. From a different species, one brings and recites. Rabbi Judah says, even from the same species one brings and recites.

### michna 8
One who designated one's Bikkurim [and then] they were looted or rotted or were stolen or lost or became ritually impure, one then brings others in their place and does not recite. The second ones are not obligated in [the penalty of an additional] fifth. If they became ritually impure within the Temple courtyard, they are destroyed and one does not recite.

### michna 9
And from where [do we know] that one is liable for their safekeeping until one brings them to the Temple Mount? Because it says (Exodus 23:19), "The first fruits of your land you must bring to the house of the Lord Your God"; this teaches that one is liable for their safekeeping until one brings them to the Temple Mount. One who brings from one species and recites, and then returns and brings another species, does not recite.

### michna 10
These are brought and recited over: [fruit] from Shavuot until Sukkot, from the seven species, from fruit in the mountains, from dates in the valleys, from oil-olives [even from] on the other side of the Jordan River. Rabbi Yose the Galilean says, we do not bring first fruits from the other side of the Jordan since it is not "the land flowing with milk and honey" [that the verse describes].

### michna 11
One who buys three trees in a fellow's property, brings and recites. Rabbi Meir says, even two [trees]. One who bought the tree and its ground brings and recites. Rabbi Judah says, even sharecroppers and renters bring and recite.
