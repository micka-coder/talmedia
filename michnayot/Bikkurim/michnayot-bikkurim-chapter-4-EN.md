### michna 1
An Androginus (a hermaphrodite, who has both male and female reproductive organs) is similar to men in some ways and to women in other ways, in some ways to both and in some ways to neither.

### michna 2
In what ways is s/he similar to men? Like a man, s/he is considered unclean through semen; is required to perform yibbum (levirate marriage) like a man; dresses and cuts hair like a man; marries others and is not married off, like a man; and is obliged to perform all the commandments in the Torah, like a man.

### michna 3
In what ways is he like women? He causes impurity with red discharge like women; and he must not be secluded with men, like women; and he doesn't make his brother's wife liable for yibbum (levirate marriage), like women; and he does not share [in the inheritance] with the sons, like women; and he cannot eat most holy sacrifices, like women. At his birth his mother counts the blood of her impurity like [they do when they give birth to a] girl; and he is disqualified from being a witness, like women. If he had illicit intercourse, he is disqualified from eating terumah, like women.

### michna 4
In what ways is he like both men and women? One who strikes him or curses him is liable, as in the case of men and women; one who unwittingly kills him must go into exile, and if on purpose, then [the slayer] receives the death penalty, as is the case of men and women. His mother must [at his birth] bring an offering, as in the case of men and women. He may eat holy things that are eaten outside of the Temple; and he many inherit any inheritance, as in the case of men and women. And if he said, "I will be a nazirite if he is a man and a woman", he is a nazirite.

### michna 5
And in what is he different from both men and women? One does not burn terumah if it came into contact with his discharge. Neither is he liable for entering the temple while impure, unlike men or women. He must not be sold as a Hebrew slave, unlike men or women. He cannot be evaluated, unlike men or women. If one says: "I will be a nazirite, if he is neither a man nor a woman," then he becomes a nazirite. Rabbi Meir says: the hermaphrodite is a unique creature, and the sages could not decide about him. But this is not so with a tumtum (one of doubtful sex), for sometimes he is a man and sometimes he is a woman.
