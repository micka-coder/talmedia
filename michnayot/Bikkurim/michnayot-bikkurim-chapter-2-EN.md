### michna 1
Terumah [a portion of a crop given to a Kohen, priest; pl. Kohanim, which becomes holy upon separation, and can only be consumed by Kohanim or their household] and Bikkurim [first-fruits that must be brought to the Temple in Jerusalem and given to the Kohen ] are subject to the [laws of the] death penalty [if a non- Kohen deliberately consumes them] and [the penalty of an additional] fifth, and they are forbidden to non- Kohanim, and they are the property of the Kohen, and they are neutralized in one hundred and one [of non-sanctified foodstuff], and they require hand-washing [before handling] and [a Kohen who became impure and then immersed himself to become pure again may eat them only] after sunset. All of the above is all for Terumah and Bikkurim, and not for Ma'aser [ Sheni, the second tithe of produce, which must be taken to Jerusalem and consumed there].

### michna 2
Ma'aser and Bikkurim share [laws] that are lacking in Terumah : that Ma'aser and Bikkurim must be brought to a [specific] place, require verbal recitation, and are prohibited to an Onen [a person whose close relative has died but has not yet been buried], while Rabbi Shimon permits. They both require removal [from one's home], while Rabbi Shimon exempts. Any amount of them [when mixed with normal food] is prohibited to eaten in Jerusalem. Any growth that comes from them may not be eaten in Jerusalem, neither by a non- Kohen, nor an animal, while Rabbi Shimon permits. All of the above is for Ma’aser and Bikkurim, but not for Terumah.

### michna 3
Terumah and Ma’aser share [laws] that are lacking in Bikkurim: that Terumah and Ma’aser 's threshing-floor remains are prohibited, and they have a specified amount to be given, and they are taken from all [species of] produce, [and their laws apply] both in Temple times and in post-Temple times and they are applied to produce of sharecroppers, renters, sikrikon [violent individuals who acquired fields and houses by use or threat of force, including murder], and thieves. All of the above is for Terumah and Ma’aser, but not for Bikkurim.

### michna 4
Bikkurim has qualities that neither Terumah nor Ma’aser have: that Bikkurim may be designated while still in the ground and a person may make their entire field into Bikkurim and one is responsible for their end [i.e., bringing them to Jerusalem], and they require a sacrifice, singing, waving, and staying over the night [in Jerusalem].

### michna 5
Terumat Ma’aser [a tenth of the tithe given to a Levite which must, in turn, be given to a Kohen and which becomes holy upon separation, and can only be consumed by Kohanim or their household] is similar to Bikkurim in two ways, and to Terumah in two ways. It may be taken from pure produce to [permit] impure produce [to be eaten], and [it may be taken] from produce that is not in proximity [to the produce it is making permissible], like Bikkurim. And it makes what is on the threshing floor forbidden [before it is separated], and it has a required amount, like Terumah.

### michna 6
A citron is similar to a fruit tree in three ways, and to a vegetable in one way. It is similar to a fruit tree in that [it is obligated in] Orlah [the fruit of a tree during the first three years after its planting, the consumption or usage of which is forbidden] and [ Neta ] Reva'i [the fruit of a tree in the fourth year after its planting, which must be taken to Jerusalem and consumed there], and the Sabbatical year. It is similar to a vegetable in one way, in that its Ma’aser time is determined by when it is picked; these are the words of Rabban Gamliel. Rabbi Eliezer says, it is similar to a fruit tree in all ways.

### michna 7
Human [lit., biped] blood is similar to animal blood with regard to the laws of agricultural impurity, and like insect blood in that one is not liable [for its consumption].

### michna 8
A Koi [animal of ambiguous status, exhibiting characteristics of wild and domesticated animals] is similar to a wild animal in some ways, and is similar to a domestic animal in other ways, and is similar to both in some ways, and is like neither in other ways.

### michna 9
How is it similar to a wild animal? [If slaughtered], its blood requires burial as that of a wild animal and it may not be slaughtered on a Festival; though if slaughtered, its blood should not be covered. Its [prohibited] fats cause impurity as a Nevelah [an improperly slaughtered animal of a permitted species] like a wild animal, and its impurity is doubtful and a firstborn donkey cannot be redeemed through it.

### michna 10
How is it similar to a domesticated animal? Its [prohibited] fats are prohibited like that of a domesticated animal, while eating of it doesn't induce Karet [to be cut off, spiritually, from the Jewish nation]. It cannot be purchased with tithe money to be eaten in Jerusalem. [The Kohanim ] are entitled to its shank, cheeks, and stomach; Rabbi Eliezer exempts this, [due to the law] that if one possesses an item, it is incumbent on the other [who desires it] to prove his claim to it.

### michna 11
How is it unlike both a wild animal and a domesticated animal? It is forbidden as Kilayim [the product of forbidden crossbreeding or working of certain animals with one another] with a wild animal and with a domesticated animal. If one writes that his wild animal or domesticated animal will pass to his child, he did not write over the Koi. If one said "I am hereby a Nazirite if it is a wild animal or a domesticated animal," one becomes a Nazirite. And in all other matters, it is similar to a wild animal and to a domesticated animal, and requires ritual slaughter like both of them, and imparts impurity as Nevelah, and [one is liable for eating] a limb from it [while it is still] alive like both of them.
