The High Priest then came to read [the Torah portion for the day]. He could read either wearing linen garments, or his own white robe. The synagogue attendant would take the Torah scroll, and hand it to the head of the synagogue, and the head of the synagogue would hand it to the assistant [High Priest] and the assistant would hand it over to the High Priest. The High Priest would stand, and receive it, and read "After the death" (Leviticus 16:1-34) and "On the tenth" (Leviticus 23:26-36). Then he would roll up the scroll, hold it close to his bosom, and say, "More than that which I have read before you, is written here." He would then recite by heart â€œOn the tenth day" (Numbers 29:7-11). He recites over it eight blessings: for the Torah, for the Temple Service, for thanksgiving, for the forgiveness of sins, and for the Temple separately, and for Israel separately, and for Jerusalem separately, for the priests separately, and for the rest of the prayer.

The one who sees the High Priest while he is reading does not see the bull and he-goat that are burned, and the one seeing the bull and the he-goat being burned does not see the High Priest while he is reading. Not because it is prohibited to do so, but because the distance between the two areas was great, and both rituals were performed simultaneously.

If he read in the garments of linen, he would then wash his hands and feet, undress, and go down to immerse. He came up, and dried himself, while they brought him his gold vestments. He dressed and then washed his hands and feet. He then went out and offered his ram, and the people's ram, and the seven unblemished one-year-old male sheep; these are the words of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Akiva says: They were brought with the morning Tamid offering, as well as the bull for a burnt-offering. But the he-goat which is done outside was brought with the afternoon Tamid offering.

He washed his hands and feet, undressed, and went down and immersed. He came up, and dried himself. Then they brought him his white garments, and he dressed and washed his hands and feet. He went inside to remove the ladle and coal-pan, washed his hands and feet, undressed, went down, immersed, came up, and dried himself. Then, they brought him his gold garments, he dressed, washed his hands and feet, and went into the sanctuary to burn the afternoon incense and light the lamps. He washed his hands and feet, and undressed. They then brought his personal garments. He got dressed, and they would go with him to his residence. And he would make a feast for those close to him, for having exited the Holy [of Holies] in peace.

### michna 5
The High Priest served in eight vestments, and the ordinary priest in four. The ordinary priest wore a tunic, pants, hat, and belt. The High Priest added to these the breastplate, the efod [apron], robe, and tsits [forehead plate]. They were only allowed to question the urim vetumim [oracular device carried in the breastplate] while wearing these eight vestments. The urim vetumim was only questioned on behalf of the king, court, or someone the community requires [for leadership].
