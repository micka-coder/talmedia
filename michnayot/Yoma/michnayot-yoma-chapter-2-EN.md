### michna 1
Originally, whoever wanted to remove the ashes from the altar would do it. And when there were many, they would run up the ramp, and whoever got to within four cubits [of the altar] first would win [the task of removing the ashes]. If two tied, the assigner [of tasks] would tell [all of] them: "Stick out your fingers [for the procedure to assign the task]." And what would they stick out? Either one or two [fingers], and they would not stick out their thumb in the Temple.

### michna 2
Once, two were even as they ran up the ramp, and one pushed the other, and he fell and his leg broke. And when the court saw that this practice leads to danger, they decreed that the ashes would not be removed from the altar except by lottery. There were four lotteries there, and this was the first lottery.

### michna 3
The second lottery [decided] who would slaughter [the daily sacrifice], who would throw the blood [onto the altar], who would remove the ashes from the inner altar, who would remove the ashes from the candelabra, and who would bring the limbs to the ramp: the head and the [left] hind-leg, the two fore-legs, the tail and the [right]] hind-leg, the chest and the throat, the two sides, the innards, the flour [for the accompanying meal-offering], the chavitim, and the wine. Thirteen priests were chosen in this [lottery]. Ben Azzai said before Rabbi Akiva in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua: [the animal being sacrificed] was offered the way that it walks.

### michna 4
In the third lottery, new priests [who had never offered the incense] came and drew lots. The fourth [lottery] consisted of new priests and experienced priests [to determine] who would take the limbs from the ramp to the altar.

### michna 5
The daily offering was offered by nine, ten, eleven, or twelve [priests], no less and no more. How [did this proceed]? [The offering] itself would have nine. On Sukkot, one would hold a bottle of water, making ten. For the afternoon [offering], there were eleven: [the offering] itself with nine and two holding logs of wood. And on the Sabbath there were eleven: [the offering] itself by nine, and two [more] holding censers of frankincense for the lechem hapanim [show-bread]. And on the Sabbath during Sukkot, one [more] would hold a bottle of water.

### michna 6
A ram was offered by eleven [priests]: the meat by five, the innards, the flour, and the wine by two each.

### michna 7
A bullock was offered by twenty four [priests]. The head and hind-leg: the head by one and the hind-leg by two. The tail and the [other] hind-leg: The tail by two and the hind-leg by two. The chest and the throat: the chest by one and the throat by three. The two fore-legs by two. The two sides by two. The innards and the flour and the wine by three each. What does this concern? A communal offering. But for an individual's offering, if [one priest] wanted to offer [all of] it, he could. [But] the flaying and dismembering of both [the communal and individual sacrifices] were the same.
