### michna 1
Ma'aser Sheni [second tithe, which must be eaten in Jerusalem]: may not be sold, and may not be pawned, and may not be exchanged, and may not be weighed against. A man should not say to his friend in Jerusalem, "Here is wine, and give me oil." This goes for all other fruit as well. But one can give it to another as a free gift.

### michna 2
The animal tithe: may not be sold while unblemished and alive, nor while blemished and alive or slaughtered, and may not be used to betroth a woman. A firstborn animal: may be sold while unblemished and alive, and while blemished and alive or slaughtered, and may be used to betroth a woman. One may not redeem Ma'aser Sheni [by exchanging its value] with an blank coin, nor with a coin that is not legal tender, nor with money that is not in his possession.

### michna 3
If a person buys an animal for a Shelamim [peace offering], or a beast for meat consumption, the hide is Chulin [non-sacred produce], even if the hide is greater [in value] than the meat. Sealed jugs of wine: in a place where the custom is to sell them sealed, the pitcher is Chulin. Nuts and almonds: their shells are Chulin. Grape-skin wine before it has fermented may not be bought with tithe money. Once it has fermented, it may be bought with tithe money.

### michna 4
If one buys a beast for a Shelamim, or an animal for meat consumption, the hide is not Chulin. Opened or sealed jugs of wine: in a place where the custom is to sell them opened, the pitcher is not Chulin. Baskets of olives and baskets of grapes [sold] with their vessel; the money's worth of the vessel is not Chulin.

### michna 5
If one buys water, salt, fruits still attached to the ground, or fruits that cannot make the journey to Jerusalem, he did not buy Ma'aser. If one buys fruits unintentionally, the money is to be returned to its place [original owner]. Intentionally, they are to be brought up [on a pilgrimage] and eaten in the place [Jerusalem]. And if there is no Temple, they are to [be left to] rot.

### michna 6
If one buys an animal unintentionally, its money is to be returned to its place [original owner]. Intentionally, it is to be brought up [on a pilgrimage] and eaten in the place [Jerusalem]. And if there is no Temple, it shall be buried in its skin.

### michna 7
It is prohibited to buy male slaves, female slaves, lands, or impure animals with Ma'aser Sheni money. And if one bought [such items], he shall eat food of an equivalent worth [as Ma'aser Sheni ]. It is prohibited to bring the bird offerings of a Zav [man who has an abnormal seminal discharge], the bird offerings of a Zavah [woman who has an abnormal vaginal discharge], the bird offerings of a mother who has recently birthed, Chata'ot [sin offerings], or Ashamot [guilt offerings] with [animals bought with] Ma'aser Sheni money. And if one has brought [such animals], he shall eat food of an equivalent worth [as Ma'aser Sheni ]. This is the rule: anything besides eating, drinking, and anointing, which was purchased with Ma'aser Sheni money, [the buyer] shall eat food of an equivalent worth [as Ma'aser Sheni ].
