### michna 1
If one bent down to drink,  the water which came up on his mouth or on his moustache comes under the law of ‘if water be put’; But [what came up] on his nose or on his head or on his beard does not come under the law of ‘if water be put’. If one drew water with a jar, the water which came up on its outside, or on the rope which was wound round its neck, or on the rope which was needed for its use, comes under the law of ‘if water be put’. How much rope is needed for its use? Rabbi Shimon ben Eleazar says: a handbreadth. If he put the jar under the rain-pipe, it does not come under the law of ‘if water be put’.

### michna 2
If rain came down upon a person, even if he was unclean with a father of impurity, it does not come under the law of ‘if water be put’; But if he shook it off, it does come under the law of ‘if water be put’. If one stood under a rain-pipe to cool himself or to wash himself, [the water falling on him] is unclean if he is unclean; If he is clean, it [only] comes under the law of if water be put.

### michna 3
If one inclined a dish against a wall that it might be rinsed [by rainwater], it comes under the law of ‘if water be put’. But if in order that the wall might not be damaged, it does not come under the law of ‘if water be put’.

### michna 4
A jar into which a leak [from a roof] fell: Bet Shammai say: it should be broken. But Bet Hillel say: it may be emptied out. But they agree that one may put out his hand and take produce from it and they are insusceptible to uncleanness.

### michna 5
A tub into which a leak [from a roof] fell, the water which splashed out or ran over does not come under the law of ‘if water be put’. If one moved the tub in order to pour out the water: Bet Shammai say: it comes   under the law of ‘if water be put’. But Bet Hillel say: it does not come   under the law of ‘if water be put’. If one placed the tub in order that the leak [from the roof] should fall into it: Bet Shammai say: the water that splashes out or runs over  comes under the law of ‘if water be put’. But Bet Hillel say: it does not come under the law of ‘if water be put’. If one moved the tub in order to pour out the water, both agree that it comes under the law of ‘if water be put’. If one immersed vessels or washed his garment in a cavern, the water that came up on his hands comes under the law of ‘if water be put’; but what came up on his feet does not come under the law of ‘if water be put’. Rabbi Eliezer says: if it was not possible for him to go down into the cavern without soiling his feet, what came up on his feet also comes under the law of ‘if water be put’.

### michna 6
A basket full of lupines placed in a mikveh, one may put out his hand and take lupines from it and they remain clean. But if he lifted them out of the water, those that touch the basket are unclean, but the rest of the lupines are clean. If there was a radish in a cavern, a niddah may rinse it and leave it clean. But if she lifted it, however little, out of the water, it becomes unclean.

### michna 7
If produce fell into a channel of water, and one whose hands were unclean put out his hands and took it, his hands become clean and the produce [also] remains clean. But if his intention was that his hands should be rinsed, his hands become clean and the produce comes under the law of ‘if water be put.’

### michna 8
If a pot full of water was placed in a mikveh, and a person who was unclean by a father of impurity put his hand into the pot, it becomes unclean. But if [he was unclean] by a "touch of defilement," the pot remains clean. But any of the other liquids [contained in the pot] becomes unclean, for water cannot purify the other liquids.

### michna 9
If one drew water through a kilon (a pump-beam), it causes susceptibility to uncleanness for three days. Rabbi Akiva says: if it was dried, it at once does not cause susceptibility to uncleanness; but if it was not dried, it causes susceptibility even for thirty days.

### michna 10
If [unclean] liquids fell upon wood and rain came down upon it and [the rain water] exceeded [the liquids] in quantity, they are clean. If he took [the wood out] so that rain would come down upon it, they are unclean   even though [the rain water] exceeded in quantity. If [the wood] had absorbed unclean liquids, even if he took the wood outside in order that rain should come down upon it, it is clean. But one may not light the wood in an oven except with clean hands. Rabbi Shimon says: if the wood was moist and then he lit it, and the liquids that came out of it exceeded in quantity the liquids which it had absorbed, they become clean.

### michna 11
If the produce of the second year exceeded in quantity the produce of the third year, or the produce of the third year exceeded the produce of the fourth year, or the produce of the fourth year exceeded the produce of the fifth year, or the produce of the fifth year exceeded the produce of the sixth year, or the produce of the sixth year exceeded the produce of the seventh year, or the produce of the seventh year exceeded the produce of the year after the conclusion of the seventh year, we follow the majority. If half and half, the rule is stringent.
