A karahat [a bare patch] within a vineyard: Bet Shammai says: [it must measure] twenty-four cubits [by twenty-four cubits]. But Bet Hillel says: sixteen cubits. A mehol [an unsown belt of ground between a planted area and a fence] of a vineyard: Bet Shammai says: [it must measure] sixteen cubits. But Bet Hillel says: twelve cubits. What is a karahat of a vineyard? A vineyard which has been cleared [of vines] in its middle. If there are less than sixteen cubits, then one may not bring seed into it. If it is sixteen cubits, they leave a space in which to work [the vineyard] and they may sow the rest.

### michna 2
What is a mehol in a vineyard? [The space] between the vineyard and a fence. If there are less than twelve cubits, then one may not bring seed into it. If there are twelve cubits, they leave a space in which to work [the vineyard] and they may sow the rest.

### michna 3
Rabbi Judah says: this is nothing but the fence of the vineyard fence. What then is a mehol of a vineyard? [A space] between two vineyards. What is considered a fence? One that is ten handbreadths high. And what is considered a trench? One ten handbreadths deep and four wide.

### michna 4
A partition of reeds: if between one reed and another there are less than three handbreadths, [the space] through which a kid (young goat) could enter, it counts as a [legally effective] partition. A [stone] fence which has been broken through up to [the length of] ten cubits, [the breach] is [regarded] as a doorway; more than that, opposite the breach it is prohibited [to sow seeds]. If there were many breaches in the fence, if that which remains standing exceeds that which is broken through, it is permitted [to sow there]. But if the breached sections exceed those which remain standing, it is forbidden [to sow opposite the breaches.]

### michna 5
One who has planted a row of [at least] five vines: Bet Shammai says: these constitute a vineyard. But Bet Hillel says: they do not constitute a vineyard unless there are two rows. Consequently, one who sows four cubits within the vineyard: Beth Shammai says: he has sanctified one row [of the vineyard, and created kilayim]. But Bet Hillel says: he has sanctified two rows.

### michna 6
One who plants two [vines] opposite two [other vines], and one [other vine] forming a “tail” behold this is a vineyard. Two [vines] opposite two [other vines], and one [other vine] in between, or two opposite two, and one in the middle, these are not a vineyard until there are two opposite two with one [other] forming a tail.

### michna 7
One who has planted one row [of vines] on his own [land] and another row on his neighbor's [land], and there is a private road or a public road in the middle, or a fence lower than ten handbreadths, these [two rows] combine. If there is a fence higher than ten handbreadths they do not combine. Rabbi Judah says: If he intertwines them [the rows of vines] above [the fence] they do combine.

### michna 8
One who has planted two rows [of vines] if there are not eight cubits between them, he may not bring seed there [in the space between the two rows]. If there are three [rows] if there are not between one row and its companion sixteen cubits he may not bring seed there. Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob said in the name of Hananya ben Hakinai: even if the middle row was laid waste and there is not between one row and its companion row sixteen cubits, he may not bring seed there, but if he had planted them [two rows] at the outset, it is permitted [to sow between them] if they are eight cubits [apart].

### michna 9
One who plants his vineyard sixteen cubits, sixteen cubits [separating each row], he may bring seed there. Rabbi Judah said: It happened at Tsalmon that a man planted his vineyard on [a plan of] sixteen cubits, sixteen cubits [separating each row]. [One year] he would turn the tips of the vine branches of two [adjacent rows] towards one place, and sow the furrow [in between], and the following year he would turn the tips of the vine branches in the opposite direction, and sow the land which had been left untilled [the preceding year]. The matter came before the sages, and they declared it permitted. Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Shimon say: even one who has planted his vineyard with eight cubits [between every two rows], this is permitted.
