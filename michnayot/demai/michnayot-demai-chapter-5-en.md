One who buys bread from a baker how should he tithe? He should take sufficient for the terumat maaser and for hallah and say: “A hundredth part of what is here shall be tithe on this side, and what is nearest to it shall be the rest of the tithe. That which I made tithe will become terumat maaser for the rest, the remainder will be hallah, and the second tithe tithe is to the north or to the south of it and that will be exchanged for money.”

### michna 2
One who wishes to separate terumah and the terumat maaser together:He should take one thirty third and say: One hundredth part of what is here, on this side is non-sacred produce (hullin), and the rest shall be terumah for the whole. And the one hundred parts of non-sacred produce which is here on this side shall be tithe, and the rest that is next to it is tithe. That which I made tithe shall become the terumat maaser for it. The remainder will be hallah, and the second tithe tithe is to the north or to the south of it and that will be exchanged for money.”

Rabbi Shimon prohibits it in the case of terumat maaser, but permits it in the case of hallah.

One who buys from a poor man, and similarly a poor man to whom they given slices of bread or pieces of fig-cake, he must tithe every piece. But in the case of dates and dried figs he may mix them together and take [the tithes from the mixture]. Rabbi Judah said: When is this so? When the amount [of dates or dried figs] given to the poor man was large; but when the amount was small, he must tithe each separately.

### michna 10
A perforated pot is considered like land. If one gave terumah from [produce grown in] the soil for [produce grown in] a perforated pot, or from [produce grown in] a perforated pot for [produce grown in] the soil, his terumah is terumah. [If he gave terumah] from [produce grown in] a pot that was not perforated for [produce grown in] a pot that was perforated, [it is] terumah, but he must go back and give terumah again. [If he gave terumah] from [produce grown in] a perforated pot for [produce grown in] a pot which was not perforated, [it is] terumah, but it may not be eaten until he first gives terumah and tithes for it.

### michna 11
