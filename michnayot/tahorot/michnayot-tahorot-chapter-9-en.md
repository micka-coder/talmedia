At what stage do olives become susceptible to uncleanness?When they exude the moisture [produced] by [their lying in] the vat  but not the one [produced while they are still] in the basket, according to the words of Bet Shammai. Rabbi Shimon says: the minimum time prescribed for proper exudation is three days. Bet Hillel says: as soon as three olives stick together. Rabban Gamaliel says: as soon as their preparation is finished, and the sages agree with his view.

### michna 2
If he finished the gathering but intended to buy some more, or if he had finished buying but intended to borrow some more, or if  a time of mourning, a wedding feast or some other hindrance befell him then even if zavim and zavot trampled over them   they remain clean. If any unclean liquids fell upon them, only the place where it touched them becomes unclean. Any liquid that comes out of them is clean.

### michna 3
When their preparation is finished behold they are susceptible to uncleanness. If an unclean liquid fell upon them they become unclean. The sap that issues from them: Rabbi Eliezer says it is clean, But the sages say that it is unclean. Rabbi Shimon says: they did not dispute the ruling that sap that issues from olives is clean. But about what did they dispute? About that which comes from the vat: That Rabbi Eliezer says is clean And the sages say is unclean.

### michna 4
One who had finished [the gathering of his olives] and put aside one basketful, let   him put it [in the container] in front of a  priest, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Judah says: he must hand him over the key immediately. Rabbi Shimon says:   within twenty-four hours.

### michna 5
One who put his olives in a basket that they might be softened so that they will be easy to press, they become susceptible to uncleanness; [If he put them in a basket] to be softened so that they may be salted: Bet Shammai says: they become susceptible. Bet Hillel says: they do not become susceptible. One who splits his olives with unwashed hands, he causes them to be unclean.

### michna 6
If one put his olives on a roof to dry, even though they are piled up to the height of a cubit, they do not become susceptible to uncleanness. If he put them in the house to putrify, even though he intends to take them up on the roof, or if he put them on the roof so that they might open so that they could be salted,  they become susceptible to uncleanness. If he put them in the house while he secured his roof or until he could take them elsewhere, they do not become susceptible to uncleanness.

### michna 7
If one wants to take from them [a quantity sufficient for] one pressing or for two pressings:Bet Shammai says: he may scrape off [what he requires] in a condition of uncleanness, but he must cover up [what he takes] in a condition of cleanness. Bet Hillel says: he may also cover it up in a condition of uncleanness. Rabbi Yose says: he may dig out [what he requires] with metal axes and carry it to the press in a condition of uncleanness.

### michna 8
If a [dead] sheretz was found in the milling stones, only the place that it has touched becomes unclean. But if moisture was running, all become unclean. If it was found on the leaves, the olive-press men shall be asked whether they can say, "we did not touch it." If it touched the mass [of olives], even by as little as the bulk of a barley grain, [the mass becomes] unclean.

### michna 9
If it was found on broken off pieces but it touched as much as an egg's bulk, [the entire mass] becomes unclean. If it was found on broken off pieces that lay upon other broken off pieces, even though it touched as much as an egg's bulk, only the place it touched becomes unclean. If it was found between the wall and the olives, they remain clean. If it was found [on olives that were lying] on the roof, [the olives in] the vat remain clean. If it was found in the vat, [the olives on] the roof are [also] regarded as unclean. If it was found burnt upon the olives, and so also in the case of a rag that was completely worn out, [the olives remain] clean, because all cases of uncleanness are determined in accordance with their appearance at the time they are found.
