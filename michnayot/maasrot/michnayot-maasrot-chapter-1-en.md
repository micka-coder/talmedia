### michna 1
They stated a rule with regard to tithes: Anything which is food, and is guarded, and grows from the earth, requires tithes. And they stated another rule: Anything that is in its beginning is food, and in its end is food, even if one guards it [and does not pick it when it is small] in order to add food, requires tithes whether it is small or large. And anything that is not in its beginning food, but is in its end is food, does not require tithes until it becomes food.

### michna 2
From when are fruits required to be tithed? Figs from when they begin to ripen. Grapes and raisins, from when the seed can be seen through the skin. Sumac and strawberries, from when they redden. And all the red [fruit], from when they redden. And pomegranates, from when [their seeds] can be crushed. Dates, from when they begin to swell like leaven. Peaches, from when they develop [the appearance of] veins. Nuts, from when they become like a storehouse [for the separated nutmeat within]. Rabbi Yehudah says, nuts and almonds, from when they develop an [inner] husk.

### michna 3
Carobs, from when they form [dark] spots. All dark fruits, from when they form [dark] spots. And pears and Crustumenian pears and quinces and crab-apples, from when they lose their fuzz. All white fruits, from when they lose their fuzz. Fenugreek, from when [its seeds] will grow [if planted]. Grain and olives, from when they have produced one-third [of what they can produce].

### michna 4
And regarding vegetables: Cucumbers, gourds, melons, cucumber-melons, apples, and citrons require tithes whether large or small. Rabbi Shimon exempts the citron when small. That which requires [tithes] for bitter almonds [which require tithes only when young], is exempt [from tithes] for sweet [almonds, which require tithes only when fully grown]. That which requires for sweet, is exempt for bitter.

### michna 5
What is the [stage at which different items require tithes, just as wheat does when it reaches the] granary [stage and] requires tithes? Cucumbers and pumpkins, from when their blossoms are removed. If he doesn't remove their blossoms, from when he stacks a pile. Melons, from when they are trimmed. If they are not trimmed, from when they are stored away. Vegetables that are bundled, from when he bundles them. If he does not bundle them, from when he fills the vessel. If he does not fill the vessel, from when he has collected as much as one needs. [If collecting into] a basket, once he covers it. If he does not cover it, once he fills up the vessel. If he does not fill the vessel, once he has collected as much as he needs. In what situation does this apply? When bringing to the market. But when bringing to his house, he may eat casually from them until he reaches his house.

### michna 6
Dried pomegranate, raisins, and carobs, [require tithes] from when he stacks a pile. Onions, from when he peels [them]. If he does not peel, from when he stacks a pile. Grain, from when he smoothes [it] even. If he does not smooth even, from when he stacks a pile. Beans, from when he sifts [it]. If he does not sift, from when he smoothes even. Even though he has sifted, he may take from the broken and from the sides and from what is in the midst of the grain and eat [it].

### michna 7
Wine, from when he skims [the scum from its surface]. Even though he has skimmed, he may collect from the upper winepress and from the pipe and drink. Oil, from when it falls into the trough. Even though it has fallen, he may take from the olive pulp bale and from between the olive press-stone and from between the board and put it on the batter-cake or on the plate, but he may not put it in the pot or in the stew-pot when they are boiling. Rabbi Yehudah says, he may put it in anything, except for something that has in it vinegar and brine.

### michna 8
A round fig cake, [requires tithes] from when we smooth it out. It may be smoothed out by [the juices of] non-tithed figs or grapes. Rabbi Yehudah forbids [this]. One who smoothes out by [the juice of] grapes, does not make it susceptible to impurity. Rabbi Yehudah says that it is made susceptible to impurity. Dried figs, [require tithes] from when they are pressed. Storehouse [dried figs], from when they are rounded [into cakes]. If one was pressing [figs] with a barrel or rounding storehouse [figs], and the barrel broke or the storehouse [figs] became defective, he may not eat casually from them. Rabbi Yose permits.
