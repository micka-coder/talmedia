### michna 1
One who was taking figs through his courtyard to be dried, his children and the members of his household may eat [of them] and are exempt [from tithing]. The workers that are [working] with him, when they are not owed food by him, may eat and are exempt. But if they are owed food by him, these may not eat.

### michna 2
One who brought his workers out to the field, when they are not owed food by him, they may eat and are exempt. But if they are owed food by him, they may eat of the figs one at a time, but not from the basket, nor from the large basket, nor from the place where they dry.

### michna 3
One who hired a worker to work with olives and he said to him, “On the condition that I may eat of the olives,” he may eat of them one at a time and is exempt [from tithes]. If he combined them, he is required [to tithe]. [If he had been hired] to weed onions, and he said to him, “On the condition that I may eat of the vegetables,” he may pluck leaf by leaf and eat [without tithing]. If he combined them, he is required [to tithe].

### michna 4
If one found cut figs on the road, even beside a field of cut figs, and similarly, if a fig tree overhangs the road, and he found beneath it figs, they are allowed [to be taken without being considered] robbery, and they are exempt from tithes. But in [a case of] olives and carobs, they require [tithes]. If one found dried [untrodden] figs, then if the majority of people had already trodden [their figs], he is required [to tithe them], but if not, he is exempt. If one found slices of [trodden] fig-cake, he is required [to tithe] since it is obvious that they come from a finished item. With carobs, if one has not yet brought them to the top of the roof, if he takes some of them down for his animals he is exempt [from tithing] since he puts back the leftovers.

### michna 5
What type of courtyard makes [produce carried into it] require [tithing]? Rabbi Yishmael says: the Tyrian yard, for the vessels are protected therein. Rabbi Akiva says: any courtyard that one person may open and another may lock is exempt. Rabbi Nechemiah says: any courtyard in which a man is not ashamed to eat makes [produce] require [tithing]. Rabbi Yossi says: any courtyard into which a person may enter into and no one says to him, “What do you seek?” makes exempt. Rabbi Yehudah says: if there are two courtyards, one within the other, the inner makes [produce] require [tithing] and the outer makes exempt.

### michna 6
Roofs make [produce] exempt, even though they belong to a courtyard that makes [produce] require [tithing]. A gate house, portico, or balcony, these are like the courtyard [to which they are attached]; if [the courtyard makes the produce] require [tithes], they make it require, and if it makes exempt, they make exempt.

### michna 7
Cone-shaped huts, watchtowers, and field sheds make [produce] exempt [from tithing]. A sukkah of Ginnosar, even though it contains millstones and poultry, makes exempt. The potters' sukkah, the inner makes [produce] require [tithing] and the outer makes exempt. Rabbi Yossi says: anything that is not both a sunny season dwelling and a rainy season dwelling makes exempt. A sukkah of the festival used on the festival [of Sukkot]: Rabbi Yehudah makes [produce brought into this sukkah ] require [tithing], but the Sages exempt.

### michna 8
A fig tree that stands in a courtyard: one may eat [the figs from it] one at a time and be exempt [from tithes], but if he combined [them], he is required [to tithe]. Rabbi Shimon says: [even if he has] one in his right hand and one in his left hand and one in his mouth, [he is exempt]. If he ascended to the top [of the tree], he may fill his lap and eat.

### michna 9
A vine that is planted in a courtyard: one may take a whole cluster [and eat it without tithing]. Similarly with a pomegranate, or a melon, the words of Rabbi Tarfon. Rabbi Akiva says: he can pick [grapes] from the cluster, or take apart the pomegranate, or slice the melon [and eat without tithing]. Coriander that was sown in a courtyard: one may pluck leaf by leaf and eat [without tithing], but if he combines them, he is required [to tithe]. Satureia Thymbra, hyssop, and thyme that are in the courtyard, if they are protected, they require [tithes].

### michna 10
A fig tree that stands in a courtyard and hangs over into a garden: one may eat in his customary fashion and be exempt [from tithes]. If it stands in a garden and hangs over into a courtyard, one may eat [the figs] one at a time and be exempt, but if he combines [them], he is required [to tithe]. If it stands in the Land [of Israel] and hangs over into Chutz La'Aretz [outside of the Land of Israel, or if it stands] in Chutz La'Aretz and hangs over into the Land [of Israel], in all [cases the law] is decided according to the [position of the] root. And as regards houses in walled cities, in all [cases the law] is decided according to the [position of the] root. But as regards an Ir Miklat [city of refuge for accidental murderers], in all [cases the law] is decided according to the [position of the] branches. And as regards Jerusalem, in all [cases the law] is decided according to the [position of the] branches.
