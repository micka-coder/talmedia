### michna 1
One who uproots saplings from within his own [property] and plants them [elsewhere] within his own [property] is exempt [from tithes]. If he bought [saplings] attached to the ground, he is exempt. If he gathered them in order to send them to his fellow, he is exempt. Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah says: if similar ones were being sold in the market, behold these require [tithing].

### michna 2
One who uproots turnips and radishes from within his own [property] and plants [them elsewhere] within his own [property] for seed, he is required [to tithe], since this is their [stage at which they require tithes, just as wheat does when it reaches the] granary [stage]. If onions take root in an upper story they become pure from any impurity. If debris fell upon them and they are uncovered, they are regarded as though planted in the field.

### michna 3
A man may not sell his produce after the season for tithing has arrived to one who is not trusted concerning tithes, nor in the Sabbatical year [may one sell Sabbatical year produce] to one who is suspected of [transgressing] the Sabbatical year. If [only some of the produce] ripened, he takes the ripe ones and may sell the remainder.

### michna 4
A man may not sell his straw, nor his olive peat, nor his grape pulp to one who is not to be trusted concerning tithes, for him to extract juice from them. If he did extract [the juice], he is required to tithe, but is exempt from Terumah, because one who separates Terumah has in mind the fragments and the sides and that which is in the straw.

### michna 5
One who buys a vegetable field in Syria: If [when he bought it] the season for tithing had not yet arrived, he is required [to tithe]. If the season for tithing had arrived, he is exempt, and he may go on gathering in his usual manner. Rabbi Yehudah says: he may even hire workers and gather. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: When does this apply? When he has bought the land. But when he has not bought the land, [even] if the season for tithing had not yet arrived, he is exempt. Rabbi [Yehudah HaNassi] says: he must also separate [tithes] according to calculation.

### michna 6
One who makes grape-skin wine, and he put water by measure, and he found [afterwards that the wine is] the same measure, he is exempt [from tithes]. Rabbi Yehudah requires [tithing]. If he found more than the measure, he must give [tithes] for it from another place, according to calculation.

### michna 7
Anthills that have remained the whole night near a pile [of grain] that required [tithing], these [grains found in the anthills] require [tithing], since it is obvious that [the ants] have been dragging away the whole night from something [of which the work] was completed.

### michna 8
Garlic from Ba'albeck, onions from Rikhpa, Cicilician beans and Egyptians lentils, and Rabbi Meir says even the colocasia, and Rabbi Yossi says even the beans of the colocasia, are exempt from tithes and may be bought from any man during the Sabbatical year. The seeds of upper Luf [plant], the seeds of leeks, the seeds of onions, the seeds of turnips and radishes, and the other seeds of garden produce that are not eaten, are exempt from tithes, and may be bought from any man during the Sabbatical year; for even though their fathers [the plants from which they grew] are Terumah, these may still be eaten [by non-priests].
