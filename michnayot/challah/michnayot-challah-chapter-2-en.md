Produce from outside of the Land [of Israel] which came into the Land, is obligated in Challah [a portion of a batch of bread dough given to a Kohen (priest, pl. Kohanim ) which becomes holy upon separation, and can only be consumed by Kohanim or their household]. If it went out from here [Israel] to there [outside the Land]; Rabbi Eliezer obligates one [in Challah ], while Rabbi Akiva exempts one.

### michna 2
If earth from outside the Land came to the Land on a boat, the [produce grown from that earth] is subject to the laws of Ma'aserot [tithes] and the Sabbatical year. Rabbi Yehuda says, when is the time from which this applies? When the boat touches the ground. Dough which has been kneaded with fruit juice is obligated in Challah, and it may be eaten with unwashed hands.

### michna 3
A woman may sit and separate her Challah [and make the blessing] while naked, since she has the ability to cover herself [by crossing her legs], but a man may not do so. One who cannot knead one's dough in purity should make it in smaller portions of separate Kabim [sing., Kav a specific unit of volume, each less than the minimum quantity obligated in Challah ], rather than make the dough in a state of impurity. Rabbi Akiva says, let one defile it, and make it in a state of impurity rather than make it in separate Kabim, because just as one designates [ Challah ] as pure, so one designates that which is impure. S/he designates one [the impure] as Challah, and s/he designates one [the pure] as Challah, but separate Kabim quantities have no portion in the name [of Challah ].

### michna 4
If one makes the dough in separate Kabim quantities, and [subsequently,] they touch each other, they are exempt from Challah, unless they are attached together as one. Rabbi Eliezer says, though one who removes them from the oven and place them in a basket, the basket combines them relative to [the minimum quantity to be obligated in] Challah.

### michna 5
If one separates Challah while it is flour, it is not valid Challah, and [if the Kohen takes it,] it is considered as something stolen in the Kohen 's hand. The dough itself, though, is still obligated in Challah ; if there is enough of a quantity of flour, it is subject to Challah and prohibited to non- Kohanim, these are the words of Rabbi Yehoshua. [The Sages] say to Rabbi Yehoshua: There was a case [where Challah was mistakenly given], and a scholar non- Kohen seized it. Rabbi Yehoshua said to them, he did too do something damaging to himself, though he helped others [who will think it is permitted].

### michna 6
Five quarters [of a Kav ] of flour are obligated in Challah. If they and their leaven, and their light bran and their coarse bran make up five quarters, they are obligated [in Challah ]. If their coarse bran was removed and then was returned to them, [it is excluded from the total] and is exempt from Challah.

### michna 7
The minimum measure of Challah is one twenty-fourth [of the dough]. If one makes dough for oneself, or if one makes a dough for his son's banquet, [then the minimum measure is] one twenty-fourth. If a baker makes [dough] to sell in the market, and if a woman makes [dough] to sell in the market, [the minimum measure is] one-forty eighth. If her dough became impure mistakenly, or accidentally, [the minimum measure] is one forty-eighth. If it was defiled on purpose, it is one twenty-fourth, so that the sinner does not profit [from his sin].

### michna 8
Rabbi Eliezer says, Challah may be taken from pure dough on behalf of impure dough. How so? If one has pure dough and impure dough, he takes sufficient Challah from the dough whose Challah has not been taken, and he places an amount less than the [volume of an] egg in the middle, [thus connecting the two] so that he will be taking from that which is nearby, but the Sages forbade this.
