### michna 1
From when can one take out dung to the dung-heaps? From the time the workers cease their work--these are the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehudah says, from when the "sweet stuff" has dried out. Rabbi Yossi says, from when they are tied [the "sweet stuff" is so dried it forms knots].

### michna 2
How much dung may be deposited? Three dung-heaps to every Beit Se'ah [an area of 50 x 50 cubits] [consisting of a minimum of] ten baskets of a Letekh [specific unit of volume] each. One may add to the [number of] baskets, but not to the [number of] heaps. Rabbi Shimon says, even to the [number of] heaps.

### michna 3
A person may make up to three heaps of manure per Beit Se'ah. Rabbi Shimon says more. The sages forbid [more] unless he has lowered [the surface] three [handbreadths] or raised [the surface] up three [handbreadths]. A person may heap up his manure into one great heap. Rabbi Me'ir forbids, unless he has deepened three [handbreadths] or raised up three [handbreadths]. If he has a small amount, he may continue adding to it. Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah forbids, unless he has deepened three [handbreadths] or raised up three [handbreadths] or places it on rock.

### michna 4
One who pens in cattle in his field [and thereby collects manure therein] may put up an enclosure over two Beit Se'in. [He may later] uproot three sides, and leave the middle [fence, and then re-fence on the other side of that remaining fence]. So it turns out, he has penned in cattle in [an area of] four Beit Se'in. Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel says, [an area of] eight Beit Se'in. If his entire field is four Beit Se'in, he should leave aside a portion of it, on account of mar'it ha'ayin [an action or situation which might be misinterpreted by the casual viewer, who might think it involves a transgression where there is none, or come to permit forbidden actions based on what he has seen]. [When the penned-in area is full,] he may remove [the manure] from the enclosure and put it in his field in the manner of those who deposit manure.

### michna 5
[During the seventh year], one may not open a quarry within his field, unless there is in it [enough stone to form] three layers, three by three [cubits] by three [cubits] high, [totaling] twenty-seven [one cubit-sized] stones.

### michna 6
A wall that has ten stones, each [stone] a two-person load, may be removed. The height of a wall is ten handbreadths. Less than this, and he should chisel and raze until it is less than one handbreadth from the ground. When is the aforementioned true? When dealing with one's own [field]. However, within that of one's neighbor, what one wants one may take. When is the aforementioned true? When one didn't start [removing the stones] prior to the seventh year. But if one started prior to the Sabbatical year, what one wants one may take [even on one's own field into the Sabbatical year].

### michna 7
Stones which were disturbed by the plow, or were covered and are now exposed - if there are [at least] two of them that are two-person loads - these may be removed. One who is removing stones from his field may remove the upper ones, but must leave those lying on the ground. Similarly, regarding piles of pebbles or of stones, one may remove the upper ones, but must leave those lying on the ground. If, however, the ground beneath them is rock or stubble, these [lowest] ones may be removed.

### michna 8
One may not construct terracing on the valley-sides in the pre-Sabbatical year once the rains have ceased, for this is considered improving [the land] for the Sabbatical year. However, one may build during the Sabbatical year once the rains have ceased, as this is [merely] improving [the land] for the post-Sabbatical year. One may not cement [the wall] with an earthen [mixture], but one may make a [rock] partition [without mortar]. Any stone which one can reach out with one's hand and take [while building], [such a stone as] this may be taken.

### michna 9
"Shoulder-stones" may be brought from any place. A contractor may bring [any type of stone] in from any place. "Shoulder-stones" are: any [stone] which cannot be picked up with one hand - thus says Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yosi says, "shoulder-stones" are as they sound - any [stone] which can be carried two or three on one's shoulder.

### michna 10
One who builds a fence between his property and that of the public domain may dig down until the bedrock. What should be done with the [dug-up] soil? Pile it in the public domain and use it for improvements; thus says Rabbi Yehoshua. Rabbi Akiva says, just as we don't put obstacles in the public thoroughfare, so too we do not make improvements to it. [Rather] what should be done with the soil? Pile it in one's own property as one would with manure. And similarly if digging a pit, trench, or cave.
