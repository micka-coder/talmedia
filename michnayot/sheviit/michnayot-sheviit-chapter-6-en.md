### michna 1
There are three regions in regard to the Sabbatical [laws]. All [land] that was controlled by those who came up from Babylon, [that is,] from the Land of Israel until Kiziv, [its produce] may not be eaten and [it] may not be cultivated. And all [land] that was controlled by those who came up from Egypt, [that is,] from Kiziv until the river and until Amanah, [its produce] may be eaten, but [it] may not be cultivated. From the river and from Amanah and further, [its produce] may be eaten and [it] may be cultivated.

### michna 2
One may work on [produce] that has been plucked in Syria, but not on [produce] that is still attached to the ground. One may thresh and winnow and tread and pile, but one may not harvest grain or harvest grapes or harvest olives. This rule was spoken by Rabbi Akiva: all work which would be [retroactively] permitted if it were done in the Land of Israel, may be done [from the outset] in Syria.

### michna 3
Onions that have had rain fall on them and have sprouted, if their leaves are black, they are forbidden. If they became green, they are permitted. Rabbi Chanina son of Antigonus said, If they can be plucked out by their leaves, they are forbidden. And [onions] similar to this, during the year after the Sabbatical year, are permitted.

### michna 4
When is a person allowed to buy greens during the post-Sabbatical year? Whenever that species [of greenery] is producing anew. Once the [produce in a place that produces an] early crop is ripe, the [produce in a place that produces a] later crop is permitted. Rabbi permitted the buying of greens immediately upon [the beginning of] the post-Sabbatical year.

### michna 5
It is not permitted to export oil that must be burnt [because it is Terumah, produce consecrated for priestly consumption, that has been made impure] and the fruits of the Sabbatical year from the Land [of Israel] to other lands. Rabbi Shimon said, I explicitly heard that it is permissible to export to Syria, but it is not permissible to export to other lands.

### michna 6
Terumah may not be brought from outside the Land [of Israel] into the Land [of Israel]. Rabbi Shimon said, I explicitly heard that it can be brought from Syria but not from other lands.
