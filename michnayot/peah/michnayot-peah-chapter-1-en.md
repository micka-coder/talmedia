### michna 1
These are the things that have no measure: Peah [corner of the field which, while harvesting, must be left for the poor], Bikurim [First-fruits that must be brought to the Temple and given to the priest], the appearance-sacrifice [brought to the Temple on Pilgrimage Festivals], acts of kindness, and the study of the Torah. These are things the fruits of which a man enjoys in this world, while the principal remains for him in the World to Come: Honoring one's father and mother, acts of kindness, and bringing peace between a man and his fellow. But the study of Torah is equal to them all.

### michna 2
One should not make the Peah less than one-sixtieth [of the entire crop]. And although they [the Sages] say that there is no definite amount given for Peah, it is all based upon the size of the field and upon the number of poor [who will be collecting it] and upon the abundance of the crop.

### michna 3
One may give Peah from the beginning of the field or from its middle. Rabbi Shimon says: only if one gives the full measure at the end. Rabbi Yehudah says: if one has left even one stalk [at the end], he adjoins to it [what he has left to the beginning or middle, and it becomes Peah ], if not, he has merely made it ownerless.

### michna 4
They made a rule about Peah : all which is food and which is guarded and grows from the ground and collected in one crop and stored for preservation is obligated in Peah. Grain and legumes are [included] in this rule.

### michna 5
And as for the trees: the sumac, the carobs, the nuts, the almonds, the grapevines, the pomegranates, the olives, and the dates are obligated in Peah.

### michna 6
He may give Peah at any time and it is exempt from the tithes, until he smoothes out [the pile of produce]; and he may declare his produce ownerless and it is exempt from tithes, until he smooths out [the pile of produce]; and he may feed it to livestock, other animals and to birds and it is exempt from tithes, until he smoothes out [the pile]; and he may take it from the threshing-floor and sow it and it is exempt from tithes until he smoothes out [the pile] - [these are] the words of Rabbi Akiva. If a priest or a Levite bought a granary the tithes are theirs, until he smoothes out [the pile]. One who dedicates [produce for Temple use] and redeems [the dedicated produce] is obligated in tithes, until the treasurer smoothes out [the pile].
