### michna 1
Beit Shammai says: Abandoning property only to the poor is abandonment; Beit Hillel says: It is not abandonment until it has also been abandoned to the rich, like in the Sabbatical year. If all sheaves of the field are of one Kav [halachic measurement], and one sheaf is four Kav and it was forgotten, Beit Shammai says: It is not [subject to] Shikhechah [individual sheaves, forgotten in the field, which must be left for the poor to collect]; Beit Hillel says: It is [subject to] Shikhechah.

### michna 2
The sheaf that is next to a stone wall, or to a stack, or to cattle, or to vessels, and was forgotten, Beit Shammai says: It is not Shikhechah ; Beit Hillel says, “[It is] Shikhechah.

### michna 3
[The sheaves at] the heads of rows, [or] the sheaf [in an ungathered row] adjoining [an apparently forgotten sheaf], [or] the sheaf that he took to bring to the city and [afterwards] forgot it; they [Beit Hillel] concede that these are not Shikhechah.

### michna 4
And these are the heads of rows: two who started from the middle of the row, this one facing north and that one facing south, and they forgot [some sheaves] before them and after them, the ones that are before them are Shikhechah and the ones that are behind them are not Shikhechah. An individual who starts from the head of the row and forgets [some sheaves] before himself and after himself, that which is before him is not Shikhechah and that which is after him is Shikhechah, since it falls under [the prohibition of] "Do not return." This is the general rule, all that falls under "Do not return" is Shikhechah, and whatever does not fall under "Do not return" is not Shikhechah.

### michna 5
Two sheaves are Shikhechah and three are not Shikhechah, two piles of olives or carobs are Shikhechah and three are not Shikhechah, two flax-stalks are Shikhechah and three are not Shikhechah, two single grapes are Peret [fallen grapes given to the poor] and three are not Peret, two ears of grain are Leket [fallen gleanings given to the poor] and three are not Leket - [these are] the words of Beit Hillel; regarding all these, Beit Shammai said: Three [belong] to the poor and four to the property owner.

### michna 6
If a sheaf has [a volume of] two Seah [a specific unit of volume] and he forgets it, it is not Shikhechah. If two sheaves have [together a volume of] two Seah, Rabban Gamliel says: [It belongs] to the property owner; the Sages say: [It belongs] to the poor. Rabban Gamliel said, "Does an abundance of sheaves strengthen the power of the property owner or weaken his power?” They said to him, “They strengthen his power.” He said to them, “So since, at a time when there is one sheaf and it has two Se'ah and he forgot it, it is not Shikhechah, [if he had] two sheaves and they have two Se'ah, is it not the law that they will not be Shikhechah?” They said to him, “No, if you say [a law] regarding one sheaf, which is like a stack, will you say [that law] regarding two sheaves, which are like small bundles?”

### michna 7
If a standing crop has two Seah and was forgotten, it is not Shikhechah ; if it does not have two Se'ah, but it is fit to make two Seah, even if it is stunted, we view it as though it were good barley.

### michna 8
The standing crop saves the sheaf and the standing crop [from being considered Shikhechah ]. The sheaf does not save the sheaf or the standing crop. Which standing crop saves a sheaf? Anything that is not Shikhechah, even a single stalk.

### michna 9
A Seah of uprooted grain and a Seah of grain that is not uprooted - and similarly for trees, garlic, and onions - do not combine to make two Seah, but rather they are for the poor. Rabbi Yosi says: If property of the poor man comes between them, they do not combine; if not, indeed these combine.

### michna 10
Grain that is intended for animal food or for binding [other grain into sheaves] - and similarly for large bundles of garlic or smaller bundles of garlic and onion - these are not [subject to the law of] Shikhechah. And anything that [grows] concealed in the earth, like luf [Arum palaestinum] garlic and onions, Rabbi Yehuda says: They are not [subject to] Shikhechah ; t]the Sages say: They are [subject to] Shikhechah.

### michna 11
He who harvests at night and he who makes sheaves, and also a blind person, they are [subject to] Shikhechah. And if one intended to take only the coarsest ones, they will not be [subject to] Shikhechah. If he said, “Indeed, I am harvesting on the condition that whatever I forget I will take,” he is [subject to] Shikhechah.
