### michna 1
And these divide the Peah [corner of the field that must be given to the poor]: a river, a pond, a private road, a public road, a public path, a private path that is permanent during summer and winter days, uncultivated land, plowed land, and a different crop. One who harvests for the purpose of animal food creates a division - [these are] the words of Rabbi Meir; the Sages say: He does not create a division unless he plowed.

### michna 2
[Regarding] an irrigation ditch that one cannot harvest [both sides] as if [they were] one, Rabbi Yehudah says: This is a division. And all the hills that are cultivated with a hoe, even though oxen cannot cross [them] with their [plowing] equipment, he gives Peah for the whole [field, without dividing it].

### michna 3
All of these divide for seed crops and do not divide for trees, except for a fence. If there were branches that were intermingling [over the fence], this is not a division, but rather one gives Peah for everything.

### michna 4
And for carob trees, all that are in sight of one another. Rabban Gamliel said: It was customary in my fatherâ€™s house to give one Peah for the olive trees on each side, and for the carob trees [to give once for] all that are in sight of one another. Rabbi Elazar bar Tzadok says in his name: Even for the carob trees that they had in the entire city.

### michna 5
If one sows his field with one species, even though he makes it into two granaries, he gives one Peah. If he sows it with two species, even though he makes them into one granary, he gives two Peot. If he sows his field with two species of wheat: if he makes them into one granary, he gives one Peah ; if two granaries, two Peot.

### michna 6
It happened that Rabbi Shimon of Mitzpah sowed [and came] before Rabban Gamliel, and they went up to the Chamber of Hewn Stone [meeting place of the Great Sanhedrin] and they asked. Nachum the clerk said: I have received it from Rabbi Meyasha, who received it from [his] father, who received it from the Zugot [pairs of leading Sages from the earliest years of the Tannaitic period], who received it from the Prophets, [as a] Law of Moshe from Sinai: in [a case of] one who sows his field with two kinds of wheat - if he makes them into one granary, he gives one Peah ; if two granaries, two Peot.

### michna 7
If a field was harvested by non-Jews, harvested by robbers, chewed up by ants, or broken by wind or animals, it is exempt [from Peah ]. If he [the owner] harvested half and [then] robbers harvested half, it is exempt since the obligation of Peah applies only regarding standing grain.

### michna 8
If robbers harvested half, and [then] he [the owner] harvested half, he gives Peah from what he harvested. If he harvested half and sells [the other] half, the buyer gives Peah for all [the field]. If he harvested half and dedicated [the other] half [for Temple use], the one who redeems it from the treasurer gives Peah for all [the field].
