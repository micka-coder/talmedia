### michna 1
Peah [corner of the field that is given to the poor] is given while connected to the ground. From vines and palm trees, the property owner goes down and distributes [them] for the poor. Rabbi Shimon says: Also for smooth nut trees. Even if ninety-nine say to distribute and one says to plunder [i.e. to leave it for the poor to snatch what they can], to this one we listen for he has spoken as is the law.

### michna 2
For vines and palm trees, this is not so. Even if ninety-nine say to plunder and one says to distribute, to this one we listen for he has spoken as is the law.

### michna 3
If one took a part of the Peah and threw it on the rest, he gets no portion of it [thereby]. Even if he falls upon it or spreads his cloak on it, we remove it [the Peah ] from him. And thus it is for Leket [fallen gleanings given to the poor], and thus it is for the sheaf of Shikhechah [forgotten sheaves given to the poor].

### michna 4
Peah cannot be harvested with a scythe, and cannot be uprooted with a spade, so that a man will not hit his fellow.

### michna 5
[There are] three "begging" [i.e., field-access] times a day: at daybreak, at midday, and in the later afternoon. Rabban Gamliel says: They only said [i.e., specified that number] so that [the begging times] should not be reduced. Rabbi Akiva says: They only said so that that [the begging times] should not be increased. The people of Beit Nameir would gather that which was on [marked by] the rope and give Peah from each and every row.

### michna 6
A non-Jew who harvests his field and afterwards converts is exempt from [the obligation of giving] Leket and from Shikhechah and from Peah. Rabbi Yehudah obligates him in Shikhechah, since Shikhechah only applies at the time of bundling.

### michna 7
One who dedicated standing crop [to the Temple] and redeemed it, he is obligated [to give Peah ]. One who dedicated cut sheaves and redeemed them, he is obligated. [One who] dedicated standing crop and redeemed [after it became] cut sheaves, he is exempt, for at the time that it would have become obligated, it was exempt.

### michna 8
Similarly, if one dedicates his fruit before Onat Ma'asrot [the point in the development of a fruit when it becomes subject to tithing], and he redeems them, they are obligated. If [he dedicates them] after Onat Ma'asrot and he redeems them, they are obligated. If he dedicated them before they were ripe and they ripened [while possessed] by the treasurer, and afterwards he redeemed them, they are exempt, for at the time that they would have become obligated, they were exempt.

### michna 9
He who collects Peah and says: “Behold, this is for such-and-such poor man” - Rabbi Eliezer says: He acquired it for him; the Sages say: He must give it to the first poor person that he finds. The Leket, the Shikhechah, and the Peah of a non-Jew are obligated in tithes unless he abandons them.

### michna 10
What is Leket? That which drops at the time of harvesting. If he was harvesting, and harvested a handful or plucked a fistful, and a thorn pricked him and [the handful or fistful] falls from his hand to the earth, behold it belongs to the property owner. [If it fell] from inside his hand or from inside the scythe [blade, it belongs] to the poor. [If from] outside his hand, or the back of the scythe, it belongs to the property owner. [If it is] from the tip of the hand or the tip of the scythe, Rabbi Yishmael says: It is for the poor; Rabbi Akiva says: It is for the property owner.

### michna 11
[Produce in] ant-holes that are within the standing crop behold they belong to the property owner. [Produce in ant-holes that are] after the harvesters [have harvested that crop], the upper parts belong to the poor and the lower parts belong to the property owner. Rabbi Meir says: Everything is for the poor, since doubtful Leket is [nevertheless considered] Leket.
