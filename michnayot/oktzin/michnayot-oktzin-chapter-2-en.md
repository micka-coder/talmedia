Leaves of olives pickled together with the olives remain clean, for their pickling was only for the sake of appearances. The fibrous substance on a zucchini and the flower-like substance on it are clean. Rabbi Judah says: that as long as it is still before the merchant, it is unclean.

### michna 2
All kinds of pits can be defiled and defile but do not join together. The pits of fresh dates, even when detached [from the edible part], do join together; but those of dried dates do not join together. Accordingly, the stems of dried dates do join together, but that of fresh dates do not join together. If only part of a pit is detached, then only that part near the edible portion joins together. [Similarly] with a bone on which there is flesh, only that part that is close to the edible part joins together. [If a bone] has flesh only upon one of its sides: Rabbi Ishmael says: we take it as though [the flesh] encompasses it like a ring; But the sages say: [only] that part close to the edible part is included [as is the case] for example with savory, hyssop and thyme.

### michna 3
If a pomegranate or melon has rotted in part, [what is rotten] does not join together. And if [the fruit] is sound at either end but has rotted in the middle, [what is rotten] does not join together. The stem of a pomegranate does join together, but the fibrous substance in it does not join together. Rabbi Elazar says: also the comb is not susceptible to uncleanness.

### michna 4
All kinds of peels defile and are defiled, and join together. Rabbi Judah says: an onion has three skins: the innermost one whether it is in its entire state or whether it be pierced with holes joins together; the middle one when it is in a whole state joins together, but when it is pierced with holes does not join together; the outermost skin is in either case insusceptible to uncleanness.

### michna 5
If one chops up [fruit] for cooking, even if [the chopping had] not been completely finished, it is not regarded as connected. If his intention had been to pickle or to boil it, or to set it on the table, then it is regarded as connected. If he began to take [the pieces] apart, [only] that part of the food which he began to take apart is not considered connected. Nuts that had been strung together, or onions that had been piled together, count as connected. If he began to take the nuts apart, or to strip the onions, they are not connected. [Shells of] nuts and almonds are considered connected [with the edible part] until they are crushed.

### michna 6
[The shell of] a roasted egg [is considered connected] until it is cracked. That of a hard-boiled egg [is considered connected] until it is entirely broken up. A marrow-bone serves as connected until it is wholly crushed. A pomegranate that has been divided into sections is connected until it has been knocked with a stick. Similarly, loose stitches of laundrymen or a garment that had been stitched together with threads of kilayim, are connected until one begins to loosen them.

### michna 7
The [outer] leaves of vegetables: if they are green they join together, but if they have whitened they not join together. Rabbi Elazar bar Zadok says: the white leaves of cabbage join together because they are edible. So also those of lettuces, because they preserve the edible part.

### michna 8
Onion leaves or the offshoots of onions, if there is moisture in them they are to be measured as they are; if there is empty space within them, it must be squeezed tightly together. Spongy bread is measured as it is, but if there is empty space within it, it must be pressed firmly. The flesh of a calf which had swollen, or the flesh of an old [beast] that has shrunken in size, are measured in the condition they are in.

### michna 9
A cucumber planted in a pot which grew until it was out of the pot is pure. Rabbi Shimon said: what is its nature to make it clean? Rather, that which has already become unclean remains unclean, and only that which is pure can be eaten.

### michna 10
Vessels made of cattle dung or of earth through which the roots can penetrate, do not render the seeds susceptible. A perforated plant-pot does not render seeds susceptible; but if it has no hole, the seeds do become susceptible. What should be the hole's dimension? Such that a small root can push its way through. If it was filled with earth to its brim, it is deemed as a frame without an edge.
