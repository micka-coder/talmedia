A wooden vessel that was broken into two becomes clean, except for a folding table, a dish with compartments for [different kinds of] food, and a householder's footstool. Rabbi Yehudah says: also a double dish and a Babylonian drinking vessel are the same. When do wooden vessels begin to be susceptible to impurity?  A bed and a cot, after they are sanded with fish skin. If the owner determined not to sand them they are susceptible to impurity. Rabbi Meir says: a bed [becomes susceptible to impurity] when he knits three rows of meshes.

### michna 2
Wooden baskets [become susceptible to impurity] as soon as he rounds their rims and smooths the edges. But those that are made of palm-branches [become susceptible to impurity] even though their ends were not smoothed off on the inside, since they leave them like this. A basket [of reed-grass becomes susceptible to impurity] as soon as he rounds its rims and smooths the edges, and finishes its hanger. A wicker basket for flasks or for cups [is susceptible to impurity] even if he did not smooth the rough ends on the inside, since they leave them like this.

### michna 3
Small reed baskets and baskets [become susceptible to impurity] as soon as he rounds off their rims and smooths their rough ends. Large reed baskets and large hampers, as soon he makes two rows for their wide sides. The container of a sifter or a sieve and a cup of the balances, as soon as he makes one circling band for their wide sides. A willow basket, as soon as he makes  two twists around its wide sides. And a rush sieve basket, as soon as he makes one twist around it.

### michna 4
When do leather vessels become susceptible to impurity?  A leather pouch, as soon as he stitches its hem, and smooths its rough ends and makes its straps.  Rabbi Yehudah says: so soon as he makes its ears.  A leather apron  [becomes susceptible to  impurity] as soon as he stitches its hem, and smooths its rough ends and makes its strings. Rabbi Yehudah says: as soon as he makes its loops.  A leather bed cover [becomes susceptible] as soon as he stitches its hem and smooths its rough ends. Rabbi Yehudah says: as soon as he makes its straps.  A leather cushion or mattress [becomes susceptible] as soon as he stitches its hem and smooths its rough ends. Rabbi Yehudah says: as soon as he sews it up and leaves open less than five <em>tefachim</em>.

### michna 5
A basket [for figs] is susceptible to impurity, but a basket for wheat is not susceptible. Small baskets made of leaves are pure, but those made of branches are susceptible to impurity. The palm wrapping [in which dates are left] and into which they can be easily put and from which they can easily be taken out is susceptible to impurity, but if this cannot be done without tearing it or untying it, it is pure.

### michna 6
The leather glove of winnowers, of travelers, or of flax workers is susceptible to impurity. But the one for dyers or blacksmiths is pure.  Rabbi Yose says: the same applies to the glove of grist dealers. This is the general rule: that which is made for receiving anything is susceptible to impurity, but that which only offers protection against perspiration is pure.

### michna 7
The dung bag of a bull, its muzzle, the bottom board of a beehive, and a fan are pure. The cover of a small box is susceptible to impurity; the cover of a clothes chest is pure. The cover of a box, the cover of a basket, a carpenter's vice, a cushion under a box  or its arched cover, a reading-desk for a book, a bolt-socket, a lock-socket, a mezuzah case, a lyre case, a violin case, the block of the turban-makers, a wooden musical toy horse, the clappers of a wailing woman, a poor man's parasol,  bed posts, a tefillin mold, and the mold of string makers — all these are pure.  This is the general rule, Rabbi Yose said: all objects that serve as a protection to objects that a person uses, both when they  are being used and when they are not being used, are susceptible to impurity; but those that [serve them as a  protection] only when they are in use are pure.

### michna 8
The sheath of a sword, a knife or a dagger, the case for scissors, or shears or a razor, the case for make-up and the make-up box, the stylus case, the compass case, the tablet case, the case for a board, a quiver and a javelin case — all these are susceptible to impurity. The case for a double flute is susceptible to impurity if the instrument is put in from above, but if it is put in from the side it is pure. A case for flutes—Rabbi Yehudah declares it is pure because he puts it in from the side. The covering of a club, a bow or a spear are all pure. This is the general rule: that which serves as a case is susceptible to impurity, but that which is a covering is pure.
