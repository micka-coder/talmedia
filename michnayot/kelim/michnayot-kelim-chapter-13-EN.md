The sword, the knife, the dagger, the spear, the hand sickle, the grain sickle, the hair-pincers, the pair of scissors that were separated - these are subject to impurity. Rabbi Yosi says: [the portion] close to the hand is impure; [the portion] close to the head is pure. Scissors that have been separated in two - Rabbi Yehuda declares them impure, but the Sages declare them pure.

### michna 2
A <em>koligrifon </em> [tool with one end for placing bread into, and removing it from, the oven, and the other end for raking coals] whose spoon has been removed is susceptible to impurity on account of its teeth [of the rake end]. If its teeth have been removed, it is still susceptible on account of its spoon. A <em>mikchol</em> [used for cleaning out ears and applying eye makeup] whose spoon is missing is susceptible to impurity on account of its point; if its point was missing, it is still susceptible on account of its spoon. A stylus whose writing point is missing is susceptible to impurity on account of its eraser; if its eraser is missing, it is susceptible on account of its writing point. A <em>zoma listra</em> [kitchen tool with a ladle at one end and fork at the other] whose ladle is removed is susceptible to impurity on account of its fork; if its fork is missing, it is susceptible on account of its ladle.  So too with regard to the prong of a mattock. The minimum for all these instruments [to render them subject to ritual impurity]: so long as they can perform their usual work.

### michna 3
A coulter [of a plow] that is damaged is susceptible to impurity until its greater part is removed. But if its shaft-socket is broken it is pure.  A hatchet whose cutting edge is lost is susceptible to impurity on account of its splitting edge. If its splitting edge is removed, it remains susceptible on account of its cutting edge. If its shaft-socket is broken it is pure.

### michna 4
An ash-rake whose shovel end was removed is susceptible to impurity, since it is like a hammer: the words of Rabbi Meir. The Sages declare it pure. A saw missing every other tooth is pure. But if a <em>m'lo hasit</em> [distance between the splayed thumb and forefinger] of consecutive teeth remained, it is susceptible to impurity. An adze, scalpel, plane, or drill that was damaged is susceptible to impurity. If its steel edge was missing it is clean.  In all these cases if it was split into two, both [parts] remain susceptible to impurity, except for the drill.  The block of a plane by itself is pure.

### michna 5
A needle whose eye or point was removed is pure. If he fixed it for stretching [a garment] it is susceptible to impurity. A pack-[needle] whose eye was removed is still susceptible to impurity since one writes with it. If its point was removed it is pure. A stretching-pin is in either case susceptible to impurity. A needle that has become rusty: If the rust blocks it from sewing it is pure, but if not it remains susceptible to impurity. A hook that was straightened out is pure; if it is bent back it resumes its susceptibility to impurity.

### michna 6
Wood that serves a metal vessel is susceptible to impurity, but metal that serves a wooden vessel is pure. How so? If a lock is of wood and its clutches are of metal, even if only one of them is so, it is susceptible to impurity; but if the lock is of metal and its clutches are of wood, it is pure. If a ring was of metal and its seal of coral, it is susceptible to impurity; but if the ring was of coral and its seal of metal, it is pure.  The tooth in the plate of a lock or in a key is susceptible to impurity by itself.

### michna 7
Ashkelon grappling-irons which broke, but their hooks remained, are susceptible to impurity. If a pitch-fork, winnowing-fan, or rake, and similarly a hair-comb, lost one of its teeth and it was replaced by one of metal, it is susceptible to impurity. And concerning all these Rabbi Yehoshua said: The scribes have here introduced a new principle of law, and I have no explanation to offer.

### michna 8
A flax-comb whose teeth were removed but two remained is still susceptible to impurity. If only one [remained] it is pure. As regards all the teeth, each one individually is susceptible to impurity. A wool-comb: if one tooth out of every two was removed it is pure. If three consecutive teeth remained, it is susceptible to impurity. If the outermost tooth was one of them, [the comb] is pure. If two teeth were removed from the comb and made into a pair of tweezers, they are susceptible to impurity. Even if one [was removed] but it was fixed it to be used for a lamp or as a stretching-pin, it is susceptible to impurity.
