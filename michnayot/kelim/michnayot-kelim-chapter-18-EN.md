A wooden chest:   Beit Shammai says: it is measured on the inside;   and Beit Hillel says: it is measured on the outside. Both agree that the thickness of the legs and the thickness of the rim are not measured.  Rabbi Yose says: both agree that the thickness of the legs and the thickness of the rim are measured but the space between them is not measured. Rabbi Shimon Shezuri says: if the legs are one handbreadth high the space between them is not measured, and if not, [the space is] measured.

### michna 2
Its carriage: if it can be slipped off, it is not regarded as connected, nor is it included in its measurement, nor does it afford protection together with it in the tent of a corpse, nor may it be dragged on Shabbat when there is money in it. If it cannot be slipped off, it is regarded as connected, it is included in its measurement, it affords protection together with it in the tent of a corpse, and it may be dragged on Shabbat even if it contains money. Its arched top, if it is fixed [to the box], is considered connected and is measured with it, but if it is not fixed it is not connected and is not measured with it. How is it measured? By triangulating with a string. Rabbi Yehudah says: if it cannot stand by itself it is pure.

### michna 3
A chest, a box or a cupboard from which one of the legs was removed, even though it is still capable of holding [things], it is pure, as it cannot hold [things] in the usual manner. Rabbi Yose says: it is susceptible to impurity. The poles of a bed, its base, and [its] covering are pure. Only the bed itself and its frame are susceptible to impurity.  The bed frames of the Levites are pure.

### michna 4
A bed frame that is put on props: Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehudah say it is susceptible to impurity, but Rabbi Yose and Rabbi Shimon say that it is pure. Rabbi Yose said: Why is this different from the bed frames of the Levites, which are pure?

### michna 5
A bed that had contracted <em>midras</em> impurity [transmitted by sitting]: If a short side was removed and its two legs it is impure. But if a long side and two legs were removed it becomes pure. Rabbi Nehemiah says: it is impure. If he chopped off two props at opposite corners, or if he chopped off two legs at opposite corners, or if he reduced the bed to less than a <em>tefach</em> [handbreadth] high, it becomes pure.

### michna 6
A bed that had contracted <em>midras</em> impurity: If the long side of it was broken and then he repaired it, it still retains its <em>midras</em> impurity. If the second side was also broken and then he repaired it, it becomes purified from <em>midras</em> impurity, but is impure due to contact with [an object impure through] <em>midras</em>. If he did not have a chance to repair the first side before the second side broke, the bed becomes pure.

### michna 7
If a [bed] leg that had contracted <em>midras</em> impurity is attached to a bed, all the bed contracts <em>midras</em> impurity. If he removed [the leg], it retains its <em>midras</em> impurity, while the bed is [impure due to] contact with [an object impure through] <em>midras</em>. If a bed leg that was subject to a seven-day impurity [through exposure to a corpse] was joined to a bed, all the bed contracts seven-day impurity. If he removed it, it retains its seven-day impurity, while the bed is only subject to evening impurity. If a leg that was subject to evening impurity was joined to a bed, all the bed contracts evening impurity. If he subsequently removed it, it is still subject to evening impurity, and the bed becomes pure. The same law applies also to the prong of a mattock.

### michna 8
A tefillin box [worn on the head] consisting of four compartments: if he removed the first compartment, and then he affixed [another], it retains its corpse impurity, and so too with the second and the third [compartments]. If he removed the fourth [compartment], it becomes purified from corpse impurity, but it remains impure from contact with [an object impure through] corpse impurity. If he went back to the first compartment and removed it and affixed [another], it remains impure from contact [with an object impure through corpse impurity]. So too with the second [compartment]. If he then removed the third compartment and affixed [another], it becomes pure, since the fourth was impure from contact, and what is impure from contact cannot convey impurity by contact.

### michna 9
A bed, half of which was stolen or lost, or one which brothers or joint owners divided, becomes pure. If it is restored [to its former state], it is susceptible to impurity from that point onward. A bed may contract impurity when all its parts are bound together and be purified [through immersion in a mikveh in that state], the words of Rabbi Eliezer. But the sages say: it contracts impurity in its individual parts, and must be purified [by immersing] its individual parts.
