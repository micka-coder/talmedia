The following vessels protect their contents when they have a tightly fitting cover:  those made of cattle dung, of stone, of clay, of earthenware, of sodium carbonate, of the bones of a fish or of its skin, or of the bones of any animal of the sea or of its skin, and wooden vessels that not subject to impurity. They protect whether [the covers close] their mouths or their sides, whether they stand on their bottoms or lean on their sides. If they were turned over with their mouths downwards they afford protection to all that is beneath them to the deep. Rabbi Eliezer declares this impure. These protect everything, except that an earthen vessel protects only foods, liquids and earthen vessels.

### michna 2
How do they tightly fit the cover? With lime or gypsum, pitch or wax, mud or excrement, crude clay or potter's clay, or any substance that is used for plastering. One may not make a tightly fitting cover with tin or with lead because though it is a covering, it is not tightly fitting. One may not make a tightly fitting cover with swollen fig-cakes or with dough that was kneaded with fruit juice, since it might cause it to become unfit. If he did make a tightly fitting cover [from such material] it protects.

### michna 3
A stopper of a jar that is loose but does not fall out: Rabbi Yehudah says: it protects. But the Sages say: it does not protect. If its finger-hold was sunk within the jar and a <em>sheretz</em> was in it, the jar becomes unclean. If the <em>sheretz</em> was in the jar, any food in it becomes unclean.

### michna 4
A ball or coil of reed grass which was placed over the mouth of a jar: if its sides were plastered, it does not protect unless it was also plastered above and below. The same is true with regard to a patch of cloth. If it was of paper or leather and bound with a cord - if he plastered it from the sides, it protects.

### michna 5
A jar whose outer layer had been peeled off but its pitch [lining] remained intact, or also pots of fish brine which were sealed up with gypsum at a level with the brim: Rabbi Yehudah says: they do not protect. But the Sages say: they do protect.

### michna 6
A jar which had a hole in it and wine lees stopped it up, they protect it.    If he stopped it up with a vine shoot [it does not protect] until he plasters it at the sides. If there were two vine shoots, [it does not protect] unless he plastered it at the sides and also between the one shoot and the other. If a planed board was placed over the mouth of an oven, it protects if he plastered it at the sides. If there were two planed boards [it does not protect] unless he plastered at the sides and also between the one board and the other. If they were fastened together with pegs or with bamboo joints there is no need for them to be plastered in the middle.

### michna 7
If an old oven was within a new one, and netting was over the mouth of the old [some versions: new] one: If removing the old one would cause the netting to drop, all of it it is impure; but if not, it is all pure. If a new oven was within an old one and netting was over the mouth of the old one: If there was not a <em>tefach</em> of space between the new oven and the netting, all the contents of the new one are pure.

### michna 8
[Earthenware] pans one placed within the other and their rims were on the same level, and there was a <em>sheretz</em> in the upper one or in the lower one, that pan alone becomes impure but all the others remain pure. If [they were perforated] to the extent of admitting a liquid, and the <em>sheretz</em> was in the uppermost one, all become impure. If in the lowest one, that one is impure while the others remain pure. If the <em>sheretz</em> was in the uppermost one and the lowest projected above it, both are impure [and any between them are pure]. If the <em>sheretz</em> was in the uppermost and the lowest projected above it, any that have liquid enough to wet a hand in them become impure.
