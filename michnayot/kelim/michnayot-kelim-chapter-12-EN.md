If one purchases the scales of wool-dealers, they are subject to impurity, because of the hooks. Of householders, if they have hooks, they are impure. Carriers' hooks are pure. Of merchants, impure. Rabbi Yehudah says, [hooks] of merchants, what is before him is impure, and what is behind him is pure. The hooks of a footstool are impure. Of poles on a bedstead, pure. Of a strongbox, impure. Of a reed-basket, pure. Of a table, impure. Of a wooden lamp, pure. This is the rule: All [hooks] that are attached to something subject to impurity are also subject to impurity. All [hooks] that are attached to something not subject to impurity are also not subject to impurity. All [hooks] that are [detached so that] each one is by itself, are pure.

Four things Rabban Gamliel declares impure that the Sages declare pure: The metal cover of a householder's box, the hooked handle of a scraper, unfinished metal utensils, and a plank that has split in two.
