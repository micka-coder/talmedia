### michna 1
One who touches the upper beam [of a loom], the lower beam, the heddles, the warp fringe, the thread that they draw over the purple material, or thread on the shuttle which will not be woven in, remains pure. [If he touches] the woof, the standing warp, the double thread that is drawn over purple material or thread on the shuttle that will be woven in, he becomes impure. One who touches the wool that is on the distaff, or on the spool, he remains pure. If he touches the spindle's coil: Before it was uncovered  he is impure; after it was uncovered he remains pure.

### michna 2
One who touches the yoke, the crossbar, the collar-piece, or the thick ropes, even when they are being used, he remains pure. If he touched the handle, knee beam or cross-piece, he becomes impure. [If he touched] the metal rings, the guides, or the mouldboards, he becomes unclean.  Rabbi Yehudah says that he remains clean if he touched the guides since they are only made to pierce the soil.

### michna 3
One who touches the handle of a saw at this end or that end becomes impure; [If he touched] its string, cord, cross-piece or side-pieces, a carpenter's vise, or the bow-handle of a bow-drill, he remains pure. Rabbi Yehudah says: also one who touches the frame of a large saw remains pure. One who touches the bow-string or the bow, even though it was stretched, he remains pure. A mole-trap is pure. Rabbi Yehudah says: as long as it is stretched, the separate parts are [regarded as] connected.
