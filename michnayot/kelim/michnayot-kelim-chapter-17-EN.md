All vessels [of wood, leather or bone] that belong to householders [become pure if they become pierced with holes] the size of pomegranates. Rabbi Eliezer says: [the size of the required hole depends] on what it is used for. Gardeners’ vegetable baskets [become pure if the holes in them are] the size of bundles of vegetables. Baskets of householders [become clean if the holes in them are] the size of [bundles] of straws. Those of bath-keepers, if bundles of chaff [will drop through]. Rabbi Yehoshua says: in all these the size is that of pomegranates.

### michna 2
A skin bottle [becomes clean if the holes in it are of] a size through which warp-stoppers [can fall out].  If a warp-stopper cannot be held in, but it can still hold a woof-stopper, it remains impure. A dish holder that cannot hold dishes but can still hold trays remains impure. A chamber-pot that cannot hold liquids but can still hold excrement remains impure. Rabban Gamliel declares it pure since people do not usually keep one that is in such a condition.

### michna 3
Bread-baskets [become pure if] the size [of their hole is such] that loaves of bread [would fall through]. Papyrus frames into which he inserted reeds from the bottom upwards to strengthen them, are pure.  If he made walls for them, they are susceptible to impurity.  Rabbi Shimon says: if it cannot be lifted up by these walls it is pure.

### michna 4
The pomegranates of which they have spoken--three attached to one another. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: in a sifter or a sieve [the size of the hole must be such that a pomegranate will drop out] when one picks it up and walks about with it. In a basket it must be such [as would allow a pomegranate] to fall through while he hangs it behind him. And all other vessels which  cannot hold pomegranates as, for instance, the quarter <em>kav</em> measure and the half quarter <em>kav</em> measure, and small baskets, the size [of their holes must be] such as would extend over the greater part of  them, the words of Rabbi Meir.  Rabbi Shimon says: [the size of their hole must be such that] olives [could fall through]. If their sides were broken [the size of their hole must be] such as olives would drop through. If they are worn away the size must be such as would allow the objects which are usually kept in them [to drop through].

### michna 5
The pomegranate that is spoken of is neither small nor big, but medium-sized. Why is a Badan pomegranate mentioned? Because they consecrate [i.e., if they are <em>orlah</em> they forbid a mixture to which they are added] even with the smallest amount, these are the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri says, to measure the utensils with them. Rabbi Akiva says, they were mentioned for both reasons, to measure the utensils with them and because they consecrate even with the smallest amount. Rabbi Yose said, Badan pomegranates and Geba leeks were only mentioned because they need to be tithed with certainty in every case [e.g., when bought from <em>amei ha'aretz</em>].

### michna 6
[The measurement of] the egg that was mentioned is neither large nor small, but medium-sized. Rabbi Yehudah says, Bring the biggest of the big and the smallest of the small, put them in water, and divide the water [that is displaced]. Rabbi Yose said, Who will tell me which is big and which is small? Rather, it is according to the understanding of the observer.

### michna 7
[The measurement of] the dried fig that was mentioned is neither large nor small, but medium-sized. Rabbi Yehudah says, The biggest in the land of Israel is the medium-sized of other lands.

### michna 8
[The measurement of] the olive that was mentioned is neither large and not small, but medium-sized; this is the <em>egori</em> [olive].  The barley-grain that was mentioned is not large and not small, but medium-sized; this is <em>midbarit</em> [barley]. The lentil that was mentioned is neither large nor small, but medium-sized; this is the Egyptian [lentil]. All movable goods impart impurity [by forming a "tent" over a dead body and other items] if they are the thickness of a shepherd's staff - neither large nor small, but average. What is average? Any which has a circumference of a <em>tefach</em>.

### michna 9
The <em>amah</em> [cubit] that was mentioned is an average <em>amah</em>, and two <em>amah</em> measures were at the <em>Shushan Habirah</em> [area of the Temple], one in the northeastern corner and one in the southeastern corner. The one which was in the northeastern corner was greater than that of Moses by half a fingerbreadth. The one that was in the southeastern corner was greater than it by half a fingerbreadth; therefore, it is greater than that of Moses by a fingerbreadth. And why did they say [there must be] one large and one small? So that the workmen could take according to the small and return according to the large, so that they would not misappropriate consecrated goods.

### michna 10
Rabbi Meir says: all <em>amot</em> were of the medium length  except for that of the golden altar, [and] the horns, the surround  and the  base [of the copper altar]. Rabbi Yehudah says: the cubit used for building was one of six <em>tefachim</em> and that for the vessels was of five <em>tefachim</em>.

### michna 11
And sometimes they stated a smaller measure: Liquid and dry measures  were measured with the Italian standard which was the one that was used in the wilderness. Sometimes they stated [a measure]  according to the individual concerned: One who takes the handful of a grain offering; one who takes both hands full of incense; one who  drinks a cheekful on Yom Kippur; and the two meals for an eruv: food for the weekday and not Shabbat, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehudah says: for Shabbat but not for the weekday. And both intended to give the more lenient ruling. Rabbi Shimon says: two thirds of a loaf, when three [loaves] are made of a <em>kav</em> [of flour]. Rabbi Yochanan ben Beroka says: a loaf that is purchased for a <em>pundion</em> [when the price of wheat] is four <em>se'ah</em> for a <em>sela</em>.

### michna 12
And sometimes  they stated a large measure:  A ladleful of corpse mold refers to the big ladle of doctors; the split bean in the case of skin disease refers to the Cilician kind; one who eats on Yom Kippur a quantity of the bulk of a large date, refers to the size of the date and its pit; in the case of skins of wine and oil [the holes] must be as big as their large stopper; in the case of a hole for light that was not made by human hands, the minimum size of it is that of a large fist, referring to the fist of Ben Batiah. Rabbi Yose said: And it is as big as a large human head.  And in the case of one made by human hands, the prescribed size is that of the large drill in the Temple chamber, which is the size of the Italian <em>pundion</em>, or the Neronian <em>sela</em>, or like the hole in a yoke.

### michna 13
Anything that lives in the sea is pure, except the sea-dog, because it seeks refuge on dry land: the words of Rabbi Akiva. If one made vessels from what grows in the sea and joined to them anything that grows on land, even if only a thread or a cord, if it is susceptible to impurity, they are impure.

### michna 14
There are things that were created on the first day that are susceptible to impurity. On the second day, nothing created is susceptible to impurity. On the third day, there are things susceptible to impurity. On the fourth day and on the fifth day, nothing created is susceptible to impurity except for the wing of the vulture or an ostrich-egg that is plated. Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri said: Why should the wing of a vulture be different from all other wings? Anything created on the sixth day is susceptible to impurity.

### michna 15
If one makes a receptacle, whatever its size it is susceptible to impurity.  If one makes a couch or a bed, whatever its purpose it is susceptible to impurity. If one makes a wallet from untanned hide or from papyrus, it is susceptible to impurity. A pomegranate, an acorn or a nut which children hollowed out to measure dust, or fixed into a pair of scales, are susceptible to impurity, since the children did the act without intention [to fix the scales to the ground].

### michna 16
An arm of a scale or the leveling-rod that has a compartment in it for metal, and the yoke that has a compartment in it for money, and a poor person's cane that has a compartment in it for water, and a walking stick that has a compartment in it for a mezuzah or pearls - these are susceptible to impurity. And about all of these Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai said, "Woe is me if I speak! Woe is me if I do not speak!"

### michna 17
The base of the goldsmiths’ anvil is susceptible to impurity, but that of the blacksmiths is pure. A sharpening-board which has a receptacle for oil is susceptible to impurity, but one that has none is pure. A writing-tablet that has a receptacle for wax is susceptible to impurity, but one that has none is pure. A straw  mat or a tube of straw: Rabbi Akiva declares it is susceptible to impurity, but Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri declares it pure. Rabbi Shimon says: the hollow stalk of colocynth is subject to the same law. A mat of reeds or rushes is pure. A reed-tube that he cut for receiving anything remains pure until he removes all the pith.
