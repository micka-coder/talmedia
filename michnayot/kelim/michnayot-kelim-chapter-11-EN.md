Metal vessels, whether they are simple or form a receptacle, are susceptible to impurity. If they break, they become clean. If they were re-made into vessels, they revert to their former impurity. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: this does not apply to every form of impurity but only to that contracted from a corpse.

### michna 2
Every metal vessel that has a name of its own is susceptible to impurity, except for a door, a bolt, a lock, a socket under a hinge, a hinge, a clapper, and the [threshold] groove under a door post, since these are intended to be attached to the ground.

### michna 3
One who makes vessels from iron ore, from smelted iron, from the hoop of a wheel, from sheets, from plating, from the bases, rims or handles of vessels, from chippings or filings, they are pure. Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri says: even from those made of pieces of vessels.  From pieces of vessels, from pieces of old vessels, or from nails that were known to have been made from vessels, are impure. From ordinary nails: Beit Shammai says: they are impure; and Beit Hillel says that they are pure.

### michna 4
Ritually impure iron which was smelted together with pure iron: if the greater part was from the impure iron, [the vessel made from the mixture] is impure; if the greater part was from the pure [iron], [the vessel is] pure. If each was half, it is impure. The same law also applies to a mixture of cement and cattle dung. A door bolt is susceptible to impurity, but [one of wood] that is covered with metal is not susceptible to impurity. The clutch and the crosspiece [of a lock] are susceptible to impurity. A door-bolt: Rabbi Yehoshua says: he may remove it from one door and hang it on another on Shabbat. Rabbi Tarfon says: it is to him like all other vessels and it may be carried about in a courtyard.

### michna 5
The scorpion [-shaped] bit of a bridle is susceptible to impurity, but the cheek-pieces are not susceptible. Rabbi Eliezer declares the cheek-pieces susceptible to impurity. But the Sages say that only the scorpion-bit is susceptible to impurity. And when they are joined together it is all susceptible to impurity.

### michna 6
A metal spindle-knob: Rabbi Akiva declares it susceptible to impurity, but the Sages declare it not susceptible. If it was only plated [with metal] it is pure. A spindle, a distaff, a rod, a double flute and a pipe: if they are of metal they are susceptible to impurity, but if they are only plated [with metal] they are pure. A double flute: if it has a receptacle for the wings it is susceptible to impurity in either case.

### michna 7
A curved horn is susceptible to impurity but a straight one is not susceptible to impurity. If its mouthpiece was covered with metal it is impure. If its broad side [is covered with metal]: Rabbi Tarfon says it is susceptible to impurity, but the Sages say it is not susceptible to impurity. When they are joined together it is all susceptible to impurity. Similarly: the branches of a candlestick are not susceptible to impurity, but the cups and the base are susceptible to impurity. When they are joined together it is all susceptible to impurity.

### michna 8
A helmet is susceptible to impurity but the cheek-pieces are not susceptible. But if they have a receptacle for water they are susceptible to impurity. All weapons of war are susceptible to impurity: a javelin, a spear-head, metal boots, and a breastplate are susceptible to impurity.  All women's ornaments are susceptible to impurity: a "city of gold" [a kind of tiara], a necklace, earrings, finger-rings, a ring whether it has a seal or does not have a seal, and nose-rings. A necklace which has metal beads on a thread of flax or wool and the thread broke, the beads are still susceptible to impurity, since each one is a vessel in itself. A thread of metal and the beads were of precious stones or pearls or glass, and the beads were broken while the thread alone remained, it is still susceptible to impurity. The remnants of a necklace [are susceptible] as long as there is enough for the neck of a little girl.  Rabbi Eliezer says: even if only one ring remained it is susceptible, for they hang it around the neck.

### michna 9
If an earring was shaped like a pot at its bottom and like a lentil at the top and it fell apart, the pot-shaped section is susceptible to impurity because it is a receptacle, while the lentil shaped section is susceptible to impurity in itself. The hook is pure. If it was in the shape of a cluster of grapes and it fell apart, they are pure.
