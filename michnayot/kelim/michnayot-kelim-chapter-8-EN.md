An oven which they partitioned with boards or hangings, and in it was found a <em>sheretz</em> [one of a number of species of reptiles and rodents] in one compartment, the entire oven is impure. If a hive is broken and its gap stopped up with straw, and it was suspended within the air-space of an oven while a <em>sheretz</em> was within it [the hive], the oven becomes impure. If a <em>sheretz</em> was within the oven, any food within the hive becomes impure. But Rabbi Eliezer says that it is pure. Rabbi Eliezer said: If it affords protection in the case of a corpse, which is more consequential, should it not afford protection in the case of an earthenware vessel, which is less consequential? They said to him: If it affords protection in the case of a corpse, it is because tents may be divided; should it also afford protection in the case of an earthenware vessel, which may not be divided?

### michna 2
If the hive was complete, and so too in the case of a basket or a skin-bottle, and a <em>sheretz</em> was within it, the oven remains pure.    If the <em>sheretz</em> was in the oven, any food in the hive remains pure. If a hole was made in it: A vessel that is used for food must have a hole large enough for olives to fall through. If it is used for liquids the hole must be large enough for liquids to pass through it. And if it is used for either, they place upon it the greater restriction: the hole need only be large enough for liquids to pass through it.

### michna 3
Netting placed over the mouth of an oven and slightly sinking into it, and having no frame: If a <em>sheretz</em> was in it, the oven becomes impure; if the <em>sheretz</em> was in the oven, the food in the netting becomes impure, since only vessels afford protection against an impurity in an earthen vessel. If a barrel full of pure liquids is placed beneath the bottom of an oven, and a <em>sheretz</em> is in the oven – the barrel and the liquids remain pure. If it was inverted, with its mouth over the air-space of the oven, and a <em>sheretz</em> was in the oven, the liquid that clings to the sides of the barrel remains pure.

### michna 4
A pot which was placed in an oven—if a <em>sheretz</em> was in the oven, the pot remains pure, since an earthenware vessel does not impart impurity to vessels. If it contained dripping liquid, it [the liquid] contracts impurity and the pot also becomes impure. It is as if this one says, "That which made you unclean did not make me unclean, but you have made me unclean."

### michna 5
If a rooster swallowed a <em>sheretz</em> and fell within the air-space of an oven, the oven remains pure. If the rooster died, the oven becomes impure. If a <em>sheretz</em> was found in an oven, any bread in it contracts second degree impurity since the oven is of the first degree.

### michna 6
If a leavening pot with a tightly fitting lid was put in an oven, and there was some leaven and a <em>sheretz</em> within the pot, but there was a partition of inedible bread between them, the oven is impure but the leaven is pure. But if there was an olive's bulk of a corpse [in the pot] both the oven and the house are impure, but the leaven remains pure. If in the partition [in the leaven pot] there was an opening of one handbreadth, all become impure.

### michna 7
If a <em>sheretz</em> was found in the eye-hole of an oven or of a double stove or of a single stove: If it was outside the inner edge, [the oven or stove] is pure. If it [the oven] was in the open air, even if it was an olive's bulk of corpse, it is pure. If there was [in the eye-hole] an opening of one handbreadth, it is all impure.

### michna 8
If [a <em>sheretz</em>] was found in the [place in a stove] where wood is put - Rabbi Yehudah says: If it was within the outer edge, [the stove] becomes impure. But the Sages say: If it was outside the inner edge [the stove] remains pure. Rabbi Yose says: If it was found beneath the spot where the pot is placed and inwards, [the stove] becomes impure, but if it is beneath the spot where the pot is set and outwards, it remains pure. If it was found on the place where the bath-keeper sits, or where the dyer sits, or where the olive-boilers sit, [the stove] remains pure. It only becomes impure when [the <em>sheretz</em>] is found in the enclosed part and inwards.

### michna 9
A pit [smelting furnace] which has a place on which a pot may be set is subject to ritual impurity. And so also an oven of glass-blowers, if it has a place on which a pot may be set, it is subject to impurity. The furnace of lime-burners, or of glaziers, or of potters is not subject to impurity.  A large oven: If it has a rim, it is subject to impurity. Rabbi Yehudah says: If it has coverings. Rabban Gamliel says: if it has edges.

### michna 10
If a person who came in contact with one who has contracted corpse impurity had food or liquids in his mouth, and he put his head into the air-space of an oven that was pure, they cause the oven to become impure. If a person who was ritually pure had food or liquids in his mouth, and he put his head into the air-space of an oven that was impure, [the food and drink] become impure. If a person was eating a pressed fig with impure hands, and he put his hand into his mouth to remove a small stone: Rabbi Meir declares [the fig] to be impure. But Rabbi Yehudah declares it pure. Rabbi Yose says: If he turned it over [in his mouth] it [the fig] is impure, but if he did not turn it over [the fig] is pure. If the person had a coin in his mouth, Rabbi Yose says: if he kept it there to relieve his thirst, it becomes impure.

### michna 11
If [an impure] woman had milk dripping from her breasts, and it fell into the air-space of an oven, the oven becomes impure, since a liquid conveys impurity regardless of whether one wanted it there or not. If she was sweeping [the oven] out, and a thorn pricked her and she bled, or if she burnt herself and put her finger into her mouth, the oven becomes impure.
