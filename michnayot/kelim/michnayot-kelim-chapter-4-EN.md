A piece of pottery, which cannot stand because of its handle or because it has a pointed bottom, is pure [i.e., not susceptible to ritual impurity]. If the handle broke off or the point was broken off, it is pure. Rabbi Yehudah says it is impure [i.e., capable of contracting ritual impurity]. A jug which lost a piece but can still contain with its sides, or became divided like two troughs - Rabbi Yehudah says it is pure, but the Sages say it is impure.

### michna 2
A jug which broke and cannot be carried while holding half a <em>kav</em> of dried figs is pure. A defective vessel which cracked and can no longer hold liquids, even though it can still hold food, is pure, because a broken utensil cannot be considered to become further broken.

### michna 3
What is considered a defective vessel?  Any whose handles were broken off. If it had hollow knobs, if it can hold olives it can become impure by touching and can make things opposite it impure through the air. If it cannot hold olives it can become impure by touching but does not make things opposite it impure.  If it was laying on its side like a <em>katedrah</em> chair - if it can hold olives, it can become impure by touching and can make things opposite it impure through the air; if it cannot hold olives, it can become impure by touching but does not make things opposite it impure through the air. The bottom of a pointed vessel and the bottom of Sidonian cups, even though they cannot rest without support, they are impure because they were made this way.

### michna 4
An earthenware vessel that has three lips, if the inner one extends, everything is pure; if the outer one extends, everything is impure.  If the middle one extends, from it to the inside is impure, and from it to the outside is pure.  If they were all even, Rabbi Yehudah says the middle one is divided, but the Sages say the entire vessel is pure. When does an earthenware vessel become susceptible to impurity? When it is fired in the kiln, and this completes its work.
