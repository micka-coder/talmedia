### michna 1
Glass vessels--those that are flat are pure and those that have receptacles are susceptible. After they are broken they become clean. If he again made vessels of them they become susceptible to uncleanness from that point and onward. A glass tray or a flat dish is pure. If it has a rim it is susceptible. The concave bottom of a glass  bowl or plate which was adapted for use is pure. If it was polished or scraped with a file it becomes susceptible to  uncleanness.

### michna 2
A mirror is pure. A tray that was made into a mirror remains susceptible, but if it was originally made to serve as a mirror it is pure. A large [glass] spoon that has been placed on a table is susceptible to uncleanness if it can hold anything whatsoever. But if it cannot do so: Rabbi Akiva says that it is susceptible, And Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri says that it is pure.

### michna 3
A cup the greater part of which is broken off is pure. If it was broken in three places extending over its greater part it is pure. Rabbi Shimon says: if it lets the greater part of the water leak out it is pure. If a hole appeared in it and it was mended with tin or pitch it is pure. Rabbi Yose says:  if with tin it is susceptible to uncleanness, but if with pitch it is pure.

### michna 4
A small flask whose neck  was removed remains susceptible to uncleanness, But a large one whose neck was removed becomes pure. [A small flask] of spikenard oil whose neck was removed becomes pure, since it scratches the hand. Large flagons whose necks were removed remain susceptible to uncleanness, since they are adapted for the use of holding pickled foods. A glass funnel is clean. Rabbi Yose said: Happy are you Kelim; for you began with uncleanness, but you ended with cleanness.
