A ball, a mold, an amulet or tefillin which were torn [after becoming impure]: one that touches them becomes impure, but one that touches what is inside them remains pure. A saddle which was torn: one that touches its contents becomes impure, because the stitching joins them.

### michna 2
The following are susceptible to impurity as objects that are fit for riding upon: an Ashkelonian saddle, a Medean saddle, a camel's cushion, and a horse-cloth. Rabbi Yose says: a horse-cloth is susceptible to impurity as a seat, since people stand on it  in the arena. But a saddle of a camel is susceptible to [sitting] impurity.

### michna 3
What is the practical difference between [the uncleanness of an object used for] riding upon and [one used for] sitting upon?  [An object] ridden upon has a distinction between contact with it and carrying it, but in the case of [an object that is] sat upon, there is no difference between contact with it and carrying it. The pack-frame of a donkey on which he sat is pure, but if he changed the size of the spaces or if they have been broken one into another, it is susceptible to impurity.

### michna 4
The bier, the mattress and the pillow of a corpse are susceptible to <em>midras</em> uncleanness [transmitted by sitting or lying]. A bridal chair, a birthing stool, and a launderer's stool on which he piles the clothes: Rabbi Yose says: they are not regarded as a seat.

### michna 5
A fishing net is susceptible to uncleanness on account of its bag. Nets, snares, bird-traps, slings and fishermen's skeins are susceptible to impurity. A fish-trap, a bird-basket and a bird-cage are not susceptible to impurity.
