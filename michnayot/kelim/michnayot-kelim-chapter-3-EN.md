The measure of [a hole in] a clay vessel to make it pure, if it is used for foods, its measure is with olives. If it is used for liquids, its measure is with liquids. If it is used for this [foods] and for that [liquids], they impose the stringent ruling on it, with olives.

### michna 2
Concerning a jug, its measure [of a hole large enough to render it ritually pure] is with dried figs, [these are] the words of Rabbi Shimon. Rabbi Yehudah says, with nuts. Rabbi Meir says, with olives. Concerning a stew pot and a cooking pot, their measure is with olives. Concerning an [oil] cruse and a pitcher, their measure is with oil. Concerning a jug [for oil or wine], its measure is with water. Rabbi Shimon says, concerning these three, [their measure] is with seeds. Concerning a lamp, its measure is with oil. R. Eliezer says "with a small perutah."  Concerning a lamp whose spout has been taken, it is clean. And one [made] of clay whose spout is burned by the wick, it is clean.

### michna 3
A jug which had a hole which was repaired with pitch, and it was then broken: if there is in the place of the pitch [an area large] enough to hold a <em>revi'it</em>, it is still impure because it did not lose the status of a vessel.  If it was made of earthenware and it was pierced and repaired with pitch, even if it holds a <em>revi'it</em> it is pure because it lost the status of a vessel.

### michna 4
A jar that is broken, and it is plastered with dung, even if when the dung is removed the shards will fall apart, [can become] impure because it retains the status of a vessel. If it was broken and shards from it are stuck together, or shards are brought from another place and plastered with dung, even if when the dung is removed the shards remain together, it is pure, because it has lost the status of a vessel. If there is a shard that can hold a <em>revi'it</em>, the whole [vessel] is susceptible to impurity by contact, and [what is] opposite from it is made impure through the air.

### michna 5
If an intact clay vessel is plastered, Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Shimon [declare] it susceptible to impurity. The Sages say, if an intact clay vessel is plastered, it is not subject to impurity. And an unsound vessel  may become impure [if plastered].  And so also for the [clay] lining of a gourd.

### michna 6
The pulp used to line large jars is subject to ritual impurity through touch.  The stopper of a jar is not [considered] connected [to the jar].  Whatever touches the plaster of the oven [may become] impure.

### michna 7
If a vessel for heating water is plastered with potter's clay or kaolin, whatever touches the clay is subject to impurity, but whatever touches the kaolin is not subject to impurity. A kettle that was perforated and repaired with pitch, Rabbi Yose [declares it] pure because it is not able to hold hot water as [it can hold] cold [water]. And so he says with regard to vessels of pitch. Vessels of copper plastered with pitch, they are pure. But if [they are] for wine, they are subject to impurity.

### michna 8
A jar which was perforated and repaired with more pitch than needed, whatever touches the [pitch that is] necessary may become impure.  [Whatever touches] the extra pitch remains pure. Pitch that drops on a jar, whatever touches it is pure. A funnel [made of] wood or of clay which is plugged with pitch, Rabbi Eliezer ben Azariah declares it subject to become impure. Rabbi Akiva declares it subject to become impure if it is of wood, but not if it is of clay. Rabbi Yose declares both of them pure.
