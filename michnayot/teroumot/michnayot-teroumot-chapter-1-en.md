Five may not give terumah, and if they do so, their terumah is not considered terumah:A heresh (deaf-mute); an imbecile, a minor, And the one who gives terumah from that which is not his own. If a non-Jew gave terumah from that which belongs to an Israelite, even if it was with his permission, his terumah is not terumah.

### michna 2
A “heresh”, who speaks but cannot hear, may not give terumah, but if he does so, his terumah is terumah. The “heresh” of whom the sages generally speak is one who neither hears nor speaks.

### michna 3
A minor who has not yet produced two [pubic] hairs: Rabbi Judah says: his terumah is terumah. Rabbi Yose says: if he has not arrived at the age when his vows are valid, his terumah is not terumah, but if he has arrived at an age where his vows are valid, his terumah is terumah.

### michna 4
They should not take terumah from olives for oil, or from grapes for wine. If one did: Bet Shammai says: there is terumah in [the olives or grapes] themselves. But Bet Hillel says: the terumah is not terumah.

### michna 5
They do not take terumah from ‘gleanings’, from ‘the forgotten sheaf’, from peah or from ownerless produce. [Neither is it taken] from first tithe from which terumah had already been taken, nor from second tithe and dedicated produce that had been redeemed. [Nor is it taken] from that which is subject [to terumah] for that which is exempt [from terumah], nor from that which is exempt for that which is subject. Nor from produce already plucked [from the soil] for that attached to it, nor from that attached [to the soil] for that already plucked. Nor from new produce for old, nor from old for new. Nor from produce from the land of Israel for produce grown outside the land, nor from that grown out of the land for that grown in the land. [In all these cases] if they did take terumah, their terumah is not terumah.

### michna 6
Five may not give terumah, but if they do, their terumah is terumah.A mute person; A drunken person; One who is naked; A blind person; Or one who has had a seminal emission. They may not give terumah, but if they do their terumah is valid.

### michna 7
They may not give terumah according to measure, or weight, or number, but one may give it from that which has already been measured, weighed or counted. They may not give terumah in a basket or a hamper of a measured capacity, but one may give in it when it is a half or a third filled. He may not give a half of seah in a seah measuring vessel, for this half constitutes a known measure.

### michna 8
They may not give terumah from oil for crushed olives nor may [they give terumah from] wine for trodden grapes. If he did so, his terumah is terumah, but he must give terumah again. The first terumah renders on its own [produce into which it falls] “doubtful terumah” and is subject to the added fifth, but not the second.

### michna 9
They may give terumah from oil for pickled olives, or from wine for grapes made into raisins. Behold, he gave terumah from oil for olives intended for eating, or from [other] olives for olives intended for eating, or for wine for grapes intended for eating, of from [other] grapes for grapes intended for eating, and he decided afterwards to press them, he need not give terumah again.

### michna 10
They may not take terumah from produce whose processing has been completed for produce whose processing has not been completed, or from produce whose processing has not been completed for produce whose processing has been completed or from produce whose processing has not been completed for other produce whose processing has not been completed. If they did take terumah, their terumah is terumah.

### michna 1
Five [types of people] may not set aside Terumah [produce consecrated for priestly consumption], and if they did set aside Terumah, their Terumah is not [valid] Terumah : the deaf-mute, and the shoteh, and the minor, and one who sets aside Terumah from what does not belong to him. If a non-Jew who set aside Terumah from what belongs to a Jew even with permission, [the non-Jew's] Terumah is not [valid] Terumah.

### michna 2
A deaf person who can speak but cannot hear may not set aside Terumah. But if one did set aside Terumah, one's Terumah is valid Terumah. A deaf person that the Sages refer to in all cases can neither hear nor speak.

### michna 3
Regarding a minor who has not brought forth two [pubic] hairs, Rabbi Yehudah says that his Terumah is [valid] Terumah. Rabbi Yosi says, if he has not reached an age of [responsibility for his] vows, his Terumah is not [valid] Terumah. When he reaches an age [of responsibility for his] vows, his Terumah is [valid] Terumah.

### michna 4
One may not set aside Terumah from olives for oil, and not from grapes for wine. If one did set aside Terumah [from olives for oil or grapes for wine], the school of Shammai rules that their own Terumah [that was required of the grapes or wine] is among them, and the school of Hillel rules that one's Terumah is not [valid] Terumah.

### michna 5
One may not set aside Terumah from the Leket [fallen gleanings given to the poor], or from the Shikhecha [forgotten sheaves given to the poor], or from the Pe'ah [corner of the field that must be given to the poor], or from the Hefker [ownerless], and not from the first tithe whose Terumah has already been taken, or from Ma'aser Sheni [second tithe, which must be eaten in Jerusalem] or Hekdesh [consecrated donation] that has been redeemed, and not from that which is obligated [in Terumah ] for that which is not obligated, and not from that which is not obligated to that which is obligated, and not from the picked to the unpicked, and not from the unpicked to the picked, and not from the Chadash [grain from the current year that one is forbidden to eat] for the Yashan [grain from the previous year that one is permitted to eat], and not from the Yashan for the Chadash, and not from the fruits of the Land [of Israel] for fruits from outside the Land, and not from fruits outside the Land for fruits of the Land. And if one did set aside Terumah [from these types of produce], one's Terumah is not [valid] Terumah.

### michna 6
Five [types of people] may not set aside Terumah, and if they did set aside Terumah, their Terumah is [valid] Terumah : the mute, the drunkard, the naked, the blind, and a Ba'al Keri [one who had a nocturnal emission] may not set aside Terumah, and if they did set aside Terumah, their Terumah is [valid] Terumah.

### michna 7
One may not set aside Terumah by measure, by weights, or by number. However, one may set aside Terumah from that which has been measured, weighed, or counted. One may not set aside Terumah in a basket or container with a known measure. However, one may set aside Terumah in them [by only filling them] a half or a third. One may not set aside Terumah in [a container that holds one] Seah [specific unit of volume, by only filling it] a half, since half of it is a measure.

### michna 8
One may not set aside Terumah from oil for crushed olives, nor from wine for trodden grapes. If one has already set aside Terumah, one's Terumah is [valid] Terumah, but one must again set aside Terumah. The first [set of Terumah ] will render on its own [another substance that it falls into] a forbidden mixture and requires a fine of a fifth [of its value if eaten by an Israelite], but not so with the second [set of Terumah ].

### michna 9
One may set aside Terumah from oil for pickled olives, and wine for grapes that will be made into raisins. If one set aside Terumah from oil for olives that will be eaten, or wine for grapes that will be eaten, or grapes for grapes that will be eaten, and he decided to press them, one does not need to set aside Terumah [again].

### michna 10
One may not set aside Terumah from substances whose preparations have been finished for substances whose preparations have not been finished, and not from substances whose preparations have not been finished for substances whose preparations have been finished, and not from substances whose preparations have not been finished for [other] substances whose preparations have not been finished. But if they have already set aside Terumah, their Terumah is [valid] Terumah.
