### michna 1
One must not put a cake of pressed [terumah] figs or dried [terumah] figs into fish-brine, since it spoils them. But one may place [terumah] wine into fish brine. One must not perfume the oil, But one may put honey and pepper into wine. One may not boil terumah wine, because it decreases it. Rabbi Judah permits this, because it improves it.

### michna 2
[A non-priest drank] honey of dates, wine of apples, vinegar from winter grapes, and all other kinds of fruit juice of terumah: Rabbi Eliezer makes him liable to repay their value and the fifth; But Rabbi Joshua exempts from the fifth. Rabbi Eliezer declares [these] susceptible to uncleanness as liquids. Rabbi Joshua says: the sages have not enumerated seven liquids as those that count spices, but rather they stated: seven liquids make things susceptible to uncleaness, whereas all other liquids do not make susceptible.

### michna 3
One must not make dates into honey, apples into wine, winter-grapes into vinegar, or change any other kind of fruit that is terumah or second tithe from their natural state, except olives and grapes. One does not receive forty lashes on account of orlah except with that which comes from olives and grapes. Liquids cannot be brought as first fruits, except with that which comes from olives and grapes. And no fruit juice is susceptible to uncleanness as liquids except with that which comes from olives and grapes. And nothing [that is derived from fruit] can be offered on the altar except with that which comes from olives and grapes.

### michna 4
The stems of fresh figs and dried figs, klisim and carobs of terumah are forbidden to non-priests.

### michna 5
Seeds of terumah [fruit]: When he gathers them in, they are prohibited. But if he throws them away, they are permitted. Similarly, the bones of holy things: When he gathers them in, they are prohibited. But if he throws them away, they are permitted. Coarse bran is permitted. Fine bran of new wheat is forbidden, and old wheat permitted. One may act with regard to terumah as one does with hullin. One who sifts a kav or two [of fine flour] from a seah of wheat, must not leave the rest to ruin, but rather he should put it in a hidden place.

### michna 6
If a store-chamber was cleared of terumah wheat, they do not need to force him to sit down and collect each grain, but rather he may sweep it all up in his usual manner and then deposit hullin in it.

### michna 7
Similarly, if a jar of oil is upset, they do not need to force him to sit down and scoop it up [with his fingers], but he may deal with it as he would in a case of hullin.

### michna 8
One who pours from jar to jar and three drops drip, he may place in it hullin. But if he inclined the jar [on its side] in order to drain it, it is terumah. How much terumat maaser of demai must there be for him to take it to the priest? One eighth of an eighth [of a log].

### michna 9
Vetches of terumah may be given to cattle, to wild beasts or fowls. If an Israelite hired a cow from a priest, he may give it vetches of terumah to eat. But if a priest hired a cow from an Israelite, even though the responsibility of feeding it is his, he must not feed it with vetches of terumah. If an Israelite undertakes the care of a cow from a priest, he must not feed it with vetches of terumah. But if a priest undertakes the care of a cow from an Israelite, he may feed it on vetches of terumah.

### michna 10
One may burn terumah oil that has to be burnt in synagogues, houses of study, dark alleys, and for sick people with permission of the priest. If the daughter of an Israelite married to a priest regularly goes to her father's house, her father may burn [such oil] with her permission. One may also burn [such oil] in a house of celebration but not in a house of mourning, the words of Rabbi Judah. Rabbi Yose says: in the house of mourning, but not in a house of celebration. Rabbi Meir forbids it in both places. But Rabbi Shimon permits it in both places.

### michna 1
One may not put a pressed fig cake or dried figs [that are Terumah, produce consecrated for priestly consumption] into fish brine, since it ruins them. But one may place [ Terumah ] wine into fish brine. One may not spice [ Terumah ] oil, but one may put honey and pepper into wine. One may not cook Terumah wine, because it decreases it. Rabbi Yehudah permits this, because it improves it.

### michna 2
[A non-priest who drank] honey of date, wine of apples, vinegar of winter grapes, and all other kinds of fruit juice of Terumah, Rabbi Eliezer makes him liable in [paying their] principal value and the fifth. Rabbi Yehoshua exempts. Rabbi Eliezer declares [these] susceptible to impurity as liquids. Rabbi Yehoshua says: the Sages did not count seven liquids as those that count spices, but rather stated: seven liquids make [things] susceptible to impurity, whereas all other liquids do not make susceptible.

### michna 3
One must not make dates into honey, apples into wine, winter grapes into vinegar, or change any other kind of fruit from their natural state in [a case where they are] Terumah or Ma'aser Sheni [second tithe, which must be eaten in Jerusalem], except olives and grapes alone. One does not receive forty lashes on account of Orlah [fruits in the first three years after their planting, which may not be eaten], except for that which comes out of olives and out of grapes. One may not bring liquids as Bikurim [first-fruits that must be given to the priest], except for that which comes out of olives and out of grapes. And it [fruit juice] is not susceptible to impurity as liquids, except for that which comes out of olives and out of grapes. And [fruit juice] cannot be offered on the altar, except for that which comes out of olives and out of grapes.

### michna 4
The stems of fresh figs and dried figs and Kelisim [type of fruit] and carobs of Terumah are forbidden to non-priests.

### michna 5
Seeds of Terumah [fruit]: When he gathers them in, they are forbidden [to non-priests]. But if he throws them away, they are permitted. Similarly, the bones of holy things: When he gathers them in, they are forbidden. But if he throws them away, they are permitted. Coarse bran is permitted. Bran-flour of Chadash [grain from the current year that one is forbidden to eat] is forbidden, and Yashan [grain from the previous year that one is permitted to eat] is permitted. One may act with regard to Terumah as one does with regard to Chulin [non-sacred produce]. One who sifts a Kav [specific unit of volume] or two [of fine flour] from a Se'ah [specific unit of volume] of wheat, should not ruin the rest, but rather should put it in a hidden place.

### michna 6
A store-chamber that was cleared of Terumah wheat, one should not require him to be sitting and collecting each and every [grain], but rather he may sweep it in his usual manner and then deposit Chulin in it.

### michna 7
Similarly, a jar of oil that was spilled, one should not require him to be sitting and scooping it up [with his fingers], but rather he may deal with it as he would in a case of Chulin.

### michna 8
One who pours from jar to jar and drips three drops, he may place in it Chulin. But if he tilted the jar and gathered [the drops], it is Terumah. How much Terumat Ma'aser [a portion of the tithes that is given to the priest] of Demai [produce from which it is uncertain if tithes were already taken] must there be for him to take it to the priest? One eighth of a Sheminit [specific unit of volume].

### michna 9
Vetches of Terumah, they may be fed to cattle, to wild beasts or to chickens. An Israelite who hired a cow from a priest, he may feed it vetches of Terumah. But a priest who hired a cow from an Israelite, even though the responsibility of its food is his, he may not feed it vetches of Terumah. An Israelite who undertakes the care of a cow from a priest by [splitting the growth in its] appraised value, he may not feed it vetches of Terumah. But a priest who undertakes the care of a cow from an Israelite by appraised value, he may feed it vetches of Terumah.

### michna 10
One may burn oil that has to be burnt [because it is contaminated Terumah ] in synagogues, houses of study, dark alleys, and for sick people with permission of a priest. The daughter of an Israelite who is married to a priest and regularly goes to her fatherâ€™s house, her father may burn [such oil] with her permission. One may burn [such oil] in the house of celebration but not in the house of mourning, the words of Rabbi Yehudah. Rabbi Yosi says: in the house of mourning, but not in the house of celebration. Rabbi Meir forbids [both] here and here. Rabbi Shimon permits here and here.
