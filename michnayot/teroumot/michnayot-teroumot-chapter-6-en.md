### michna 1
One who eats terumah unwittingly must repay its value plus a fifth, whether he eats it or drinks it, or anoints himself with it, or whether the terumah is clean or unclean. [If he eats the added fifth] he must pay its fifth, and a fifth of that fifth. He may not repay with terumah, but rather with tithed hullin, which becomes terumah. And whatever may be repaid in its place also becomes terumah and if the priest wishes to forego [the fine], he cannot do so.

### michna 2
A daughter of an Israelite ate terumah and afterwards married a priest:If the terumah she ate had not yet been acquired by another priest she can repay to herself the value and the fifth. But if a priest had already acquired the terumah she had eaten, she must repay the value to the owners, but [she can repay] the fifth to herself, because they said that he who eats terumah unwittingly, pays the value to the owners and the fifth to whoever he wants.

### michna 3
If one gives his workmen or his guests terumah to eat he must repay the principal and they must pay the fifth, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages say: they must pay both the value and the fifth, and he must pay them for the price of their meal.

### michna 4
If one stole terumah but did not eat it, he must return double-payment at the price of terumah. If he ate it, he must pay twice the value plus a fifth, one principal value and a fifth at the price of hullin, and the other principal at the price of terumah. If one stole terumah of dedicated property and ate it, he must repay two fifths and the principal value, for the laws of double-payment do not apply to dedicated property.

### michna 5
They may not make repayment from gleanings, from forgotten sheaf, from peah or ownerless property. Nor from first tithe from which terumah has been taken, nor from second tithe or dedicated produce which have been redeemed, because one dedicated thing (kadosh) cannot be used to redeem another dedicated thing (kadosh), the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages permit [payment] with these.

### michna 6
Rabbi Eliezer says: they may make repayment from one kind for another, provided that it is from a superior kind for an inferior kind. Rabbi Akiva says: they may make repayment only from the same kind. Hence if a man ate cucumbers grown a year before the seventh year, he must wait for those grown after the termination of the seventh year and repay with them. The same source which causes Rabbi Eliezer to be lenient causes Rabbi Akiva to be stringent, for it says: “And he shall give the priest the holy thing (hakadesh)” (Leviticus 22:14), [implying,] whatever is liable to become “kodesh,” the words of Rabbi Eliezer. But Rabbi Akiva says: “And he shall give the priest the holy thing (kodesh),” [implying] the same kind of holy thing which he ate.

### michna 1
One who eats Terumah [produce consecrated for priestly consumption] unintentionally must repay its principal value and a fifth [of its value, regardless of] whether he eats it or drinks it, or anoints himself with it, or whether the Terumah is pure or the Terumah is impure, he must pay its fifth and a fifth of that fifth [if he ate the fifth]. He may not repay with Terumah, but rather with tithed Chulin [non-sacred produce], which becomes Terumah. And the Tashlumin [payments for what was wrongfully eaten] also become Terumah and if the priest wishes to forego [the payments], he cannot forego.

### michna 2
A daughter of an Israelite who ate Terumah and afterwards was married to a priest: If she ate Terumah that had not yet been acquired by a [particular] priest, she can repay to herself the principal value and the fifth. But if she ate Terumah that a priest had already acquired, she must repay the principal value to the owners, but [she can repay] the fifth to herself, because they said that one who eats Terumah unintentionally must pay the principal value to the owners and the fifth to anyone he wants.

### michna 3
If one feeds his workers or his guests Terumah, he must pay the principal value and they must pay the fifth, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the Sages say: they must pay both the principal value and the fifth, and he must pay them the price of their meal.

### michna 4
If one stole Terumah but did not eat it, he must pay Tashlumei Kefel [a double payment] of the price of the Terumah. If he ate it, he must pay two principal values plus a fifth, one principal value and a fifth from Chulin [non-sacred produce], and one principal value at the price of Terumah. If one stole Terumah of Hekdesh [consecrated donation] and ate it, he must pay two fifths and the principal value, for Tashlumei Kefel does not apply to Hekdesh.

### michna 5
One may not pay from Leket [fallen gleanings given to the poor], from Shikhecha [forgotten sheaves given to the poor], from Pe'ah [corner of a field that must be given to the poor], or from the Hefker [ownerless property], and not Ma'aser Rishon [first tithe, which must be given to the Levite] from which Terumah has been taken, nor from Ma'aser Sheni [second tithe, which must be eaten in Jerusalem] and Hekdesh [consecrated donation] that have been redeemed, because Kodesh [consecrated material] may not be used to redeem Kodesh, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the Sages permit [payment] with these.

### michna 6
Rabbi Eliezer says: one may pay from one species for another species, provided that it is from superior [produce] for inferior [produce]. Rabbi Akiva says: one may pay only from one species for its own species. Hence if a man ate cucumbers of the pre-Sabbatical year, he must wait for the cucumbers of the post-Sabbatical year and pay with them. From the place where Rabbi Eliezer is lenient [derives his leniency], from there Rabbi Akiva is stringent, for it says: “And he shall give the priest the Kodesh ” (Leviticus 22:14). [This implies] whatever is appropriate for being Kodesh, the words of Rabbi Eliezer. But Rabbi Akiva says: “And he shall give the priest the Kodesh ” [implies] the Kodesh that he ate.
