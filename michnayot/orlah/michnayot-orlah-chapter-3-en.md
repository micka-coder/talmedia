### michna 1
A garment dyed with peels of orlah [fruit] must be burned. If it became mixed up with other [garments], all of them shall be burned, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages say: it becomes neutralized in two-hundred-and-one.

### michna 2
If one dyed a thread the whole [length] of a sit with orlah peels, and wove it into a garment, and it is not known which [thread] it is:Rabbi Meir says: the garment must be burned; But the sages say: it becomes neutralized in two-hundred-and-one.

### michna 3
If one wove thread the whole [length] of a sit from [the wool of a] first-born animal into a garment, the garment must be burned. [If from] the hair of a nazirite or of the first-born of a donkey into sack-cloth, the sack-cloth must be burned. And if even the smallest amount [from wool or hair of] consecrated [animals], that which it is woven into] is consecrated.

### michna 4
A dish which one cooked with shells of orlah must be burned. If [the dish] became mixed up with other [dishes], it becomes neutralized in two-hundred-and-one.

### michna 5
An oven that was lit with shells of orlah, and then one baked bread in it, the bread must be burned. If it became mixed up with other [loaves] it becomes neutralized in two-hundred-and-one.

### michna 6
If one has bundles of fenugreek of kilayim of the vineyard, they must be burned. If they became mixed up with others, all of them must be burned, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages say they become neutralized in two-hundred-and-one.

### michna 7
For Rabbi Meir used to say: anything that is normally [sold] by counting causes [a mixture] to become consecrated [in even the smallest amount]. But the sages say only six things consecrate [a mixture in even the smallest amount], and Rabbi Akiba says seven [things]. And these are they: Nuts with soft shells; badan pomegranates; stopped-up casks; beet shoots; cabbage-heads; Greek pumpkins. Rabbi Akiba says: also loaves [baked by] a householder. To those to which orlah applies [they prohibit the mixture] as orlah, [to those of which] kilayim of the vineyard apply [they prohibit the mixture as] kilayim of the vineyard.

### michna 8
How so? If the nuts cracked, or if the pomegranates burst open, or the casks became unstopped, or the pumpkins were cut, or the loaves were broken up, they become neutralized in two-hundred-and-one.

### michna 9
Doubtful orlah: in the land of Israel is prohibited, in Syria is permitted, and outside the land one may go down and purchase [from a non-Israelite] as long as he has not seen him gathering it. A vineyard planted with vegetables [which are kilayim], and they [the vegetables] are sold outside of it: in the land of Israel these are prohibited, and in Syria they are permitted; outside the land one may go down and purchase them as long as he does not gather [them] with [oneâ€™s own] hand. New [produce] is prohibited by the Torah in all places. And orlah is a halachah. And kilayim are an enactment of the scribes.
