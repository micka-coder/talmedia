### michna 1
One who carries jars of wine from place to place, he may not carry them in a basket or in a large basket, but he may carry [them] on his shoulder or in front of him. Similarly, one who brings straw, he may not drape a large basket over his back, rather he must carry it in his hand. And one may start [using] a heap of straw, but [one may] not [start using wood] from the back-yard.

### michna 2
One may not take wood from a sukkah but only from [what is] next to it. One may bring in from the field wood that is gathered together, and from a karpef [an enclosure] even though it is scattered about. What is a karpef? Any [enclosure] next to the town, the words of Rabbi Judah. Rabbi Yose says: Any [enclosure] which one enters with a key, even if it is [only just] within the Shabbat border.

### michna 3
One may not chop up wood, neither from beams nor from a beam which was broken on Yom Tov. And one may not chop with an axe or with a saw or with a sickle but only with a [butcher's] chopper. A [closed] room full of produce which was burst open [on Yom Tov] he may take [produce] out through the breach. Rabbi Meir says: he may make a hole at the outset and bring out [the produce].

### michna 4
One may not make a hole in a [lump of clay for use as a] lamp because that is making a vessel. One may not make charcoal on Yom Tov. And one may not cut a wick into two. Rabbi Judah says: he may cut it into two lamps using a fire.

### michna 5
One may not break up a potsherd or cut paper in order to roast on it a salty fish. And one may not rake out an oven or a range, but one may press [the ashes] down. And one may not place two jars side by side in order to balance upon them saucepan. And one may not prop up a pot with a wooden wedge and the same applies to a door. And one may not drive cattle with a staff on a festival. But Rabbi Elazar the son of Rabbi Shimon permits it.

### michna 6
Rabbi Eliezer says: a man may take a chip from that which is lying before him to pick his teeth with it, and he may collect [chips] from the court yard and make a fire, for everything in a court is prepared [for use on Yom Tov]. But the sages say: he may collect only from that which is before him and make a fire.

### michna 7
One may not produce fire either from wood, or from stones, or from dirt, or from water. Nor may one make tiles red-hot in order to roast on them. Rabbi Eliezer further said: A man may stand near his “muktzeh” on the eve of Shabbat in the sabbatical year and say: “From here I will eat tomorrow.” But the sages say: [This doesn’t work] unless he marks it out and says, “From here to there.”
