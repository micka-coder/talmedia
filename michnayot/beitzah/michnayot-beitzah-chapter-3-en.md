### michna 1
One may not catch fish from a fishpond on Yom Tov nor give them food, But one may catch game or fowl from animal enclosures and one may put food before them. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: not all enclosures are alike. This is the general rule: anything that still needs to be trapped is forbidden but anything that need not be trapped is permitted.

### michna 2
Traps for wild animals, birds or fish which were set on the eve of Yom Tov, one may not take from them on Yom Tov unless he knows that they were [already] caught on the eve of Yom Tov. It once happened that a certain non-Jew brought fish to Rabban Gamaliel [on Yom Tov] and he said: they are permitted, but I have no wish to accept [them] from him.

### michna 3
One may not slaughter [on Yom Tov] an animal which is about to die unless there is time enough on that day to eat from it as much as an olive of roasted flesh. Rabbi Akiva says: even [if there is only time to eat] as much as an olive of raw flesh [taken] from the place of slaughter. If he slaughtered it in the field, he may not bring it in on a pole or a barrow, but he may bring it in piece by piece in his hand.

### michna 4
A first-born beast that fell into a pit:Rabbi Judah says: let an expert go down and inspect [it]. If it had a blemish he may bring it up and slaughter it, but if not, he may not slaughter it. Rabbi Shimon says: any animals whose blemish was not observed on the day before the Yom Tov, it is not prepared (mukhan).

### michna 5
If a beast died [on Yom Tov] it may not be moved from its place. And it happened that they once asked Rabbi Tarfon concerning this and concerning hallah that had become defiled. He went into the bet midrash and inquired, and they answered him: they may not be moved from their place.

### michna 6
They may not be counted as having a share in an animal at the outset on Yom Tov, but they may be counted [as having a share in an animal] on the eve of Yom Tov, and they may then slaughter it and divide it between them [on Yom Tov]. Rabbi Judah says: a man may weigh meat [on Yom Tov] against a utensil or against a butcher's chopper. But the sages say: one may not pay attention to the scales at all.

### michna 7
One may not sharpen a knife on a festival, but one may draw it over another knife. A man may not say to a butcher, “Weigh me a dinar’s worth of meat” but he may slaughter [the animal] and shares it among them.

### michna 8
A man may say [on Yom Tov] to his fellow, “Fill me this vessel,” but not in a specific measure. Rabbi Judah says: if it was a measuring-vessel he may not fill it. It happened that Abba Shaul ben Batnit used to fill up his measures on the eve of Yom Tov and give them to his customers on Yom Tov. Abba Shaul says: he used to do so even during hol hamoed (the intermediate days of the festival), on account of clarifying the measures. But the sages say: he used also to do so on an ordinary day for the sake of the draining of the measures. A man may go to a shopkeeper to whom he generally goes and say to him, “Give me [so many] eggs and nuts” since this is the way of a householder to reckon in his own home.
