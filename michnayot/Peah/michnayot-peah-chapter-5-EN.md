### michna 1
A stack of grain underneath which Leket [individual stalks that fall during harvest, which must be left for the poor to glean] was not collected, everything touching the ground is for the poor. If wind scatters the sheaves, he estimates how much Leket [that field would make and gives [that amount] to the poor. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: He gives to the poor the amount that [normally] falls [in such a field].

### michna 2
An [unharvested] ear of grain [in an area already harvested] the tip of which can touch the standing crop - if it can be harvested with the standing crop, it belongs to the property owner; if not, it belongs to the poor. If an ear of grain that is Leket is intermixed in a stack, one ear must be tithed and given to him [the poor man]. Rabbi Eliezer said: And how does this poor person exchange for something that never came into his possession? Rather, he grants him the entire stack and tithes one ear and gives it to him [and then repossesses the stack].

### michna 3
One may not use an irrigating wheel [before the poor have collected Leket ]- [these are] the words of Rabbi Meir; the Sages permit it, because it is possible [to irrigate without damaging the Leket ].

### michna 4
If a property owner was passing from one place to another place, and needs to take Leket, Shikhechah [individual sheaves, forgotten in the field, which must be left for the poor to collect], or Peah [corner of the field which, while harvesting, must be left for the poor] or Ma'aser Ani [a tithe given to the poor in the third and sixth years of the Sabbatical cycle] he may take and when he returns to his house pay [for them] - [these are] the words of Rabbi Eliezer; the Sages say: He was poor at that time.

### michna 5
Someone who exchanges [his produce] with the poor [i.e. their gifts from the field], what is [now] his is exempt [in tithes] and what is [now] the poor person's is obligated [in tithes]. If two [poor people] received a field as sharecroppers, one may give the other Ma'aser Ani [a tithe given to the poor in the third and sixth years of the Sabbatical cycle] from his portion, and that other may give him Ma'aser Ani from his portion. Someone who contracts for a field to harvest, is forbidden in [taking] Leket, Shikhechah, Peah, and Ma'aser Ani. Rabbi Yehudah said: When? At a time that he contracts for a half, a third, or a fourth [of the harvest]. But if he said to him, "a third of what you harvest is yours", [then] he is permitted in [taking] Leket, Shikcha, and Peah and forbidden in Ma'aser Ani.

### michna 6
If someone sells his field, the seller is permitted [in Leket, Shikcha, and Peah ] and the buyer is forbidden. A man may not hire a worker on the condition that his [the worker's] son may glean after him. One who does not allow the poor to glean, or who allows one and not another, or who helps one of them - he is stealing from the poor. Regarding this it is said, â€œDo not encroach upon the border of those who go up [to glean"] (Proverbs 22:28).

### michna 7
A sheaf that is forgotten by workers and not forgotten by the property owner, or that is forgotten by the property owner and not forgotten by the workers, or if the poor stood before it [thereby concealing it], or covered it with straw, indeed this is not Shikhechah.

### michna 8
One who gathers sheaves into hat-shaped piles or cap-shaped piles or circular piles, these are not [subject to] Shikhechah ; if they are taken from there to the threshing floor, they are [subject to] Shikhechah. One who gathers sheaves to a stack, they are [subject to] Shikhechah ; if they are taken to the threshing floor, they are not [subject to] Shikhechah. This is the general rule: When the sheaves are gathered to a place where their work is completed, they are [subject to] Shikhechah ; from there to the threshing floor, they are not [subject to] Shikhechah. [When the sheaves are gathered] to a place where their work is not completed, they are not [subject to] Shikhechah, from there to the threshing floor, they are [subject to] Shikhechah.
