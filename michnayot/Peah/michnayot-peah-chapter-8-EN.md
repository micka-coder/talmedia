### michna 1
From when is everyone permitted in [taking] Leket [individual stalks that fall during harvest, which must be left for the poor to glean]? When the weakest of the poor have [come and] gone. And when for Peret [fallen grapes given to the poor] and Olelot [individual grapes which fall during the grape-harvest which must be left for the poor to collect]? From when the poor have [come and] gone and come [again]. And when for olive trees? When the second rain has come; Rabbi Yehudah said: Are there not those who do not harvest their olive trees until after the second rain? Rather, when the poor go out [to glean amongst the olives], and do not bring back [an amount of olives worth] four Issarot [specific unit of money].

### michna 2
[Poor] people [selling produce] are trusted regarding Leket, Shikcha, and Peah [corner of the field which, while harvesting, must be left for the poor] in their time [i.e., during the harvest], and regarding Ma'aser Ani [a second tithe given to the poor in the third and sixth years of the Sabbatical cycle] all year long. A Levite is trusted at all times. And we do not trust them [i.e., the poor] except regarding things that people are accustomed to [give them].

### michna 3
[Poor] people are trusted concerning wheat, but they are not trusted regarding flour and not regarding bread. [Poor] people are trusted regarding rice on the stalk, but are not trusted regarding it [the rice itself], whether raw or cooked. [Poor] people are trusted concerning beans, but not trusted concerning grits, whether raw or cooked. [Poor] people are trusted concerning oil, to say that it is Ma'aser Ani, but are not trusted to say that it is Nikuf [the last olives shaken down by the poor].

### michna 4
[Poor] people are trusted regarding raw vegetables but not trusted regarding cooked vegetables, unless he had a small amount, because it is common that the property owner takes it out from his stew pot.

### michna 5
One must not give less [ Ma'aser Ani ] to the poor from the threshing floor [than the following measures]: half a Kav [specific unit of volume] of wheat and a Kav of barley - Rabbi Meir says: half a Kav ; a Kav and a half of kasha; a Kav of dried figs or a Maneh [specific unit of volume] of figs - Rabbi Akiva says: a Pras [half a Maneh ]; half a Log [one fourth of a Kav ] of wine - Rabbi Akiva says: a quarter; a quarter of a Log of oil - Rabbi Akiva says: An eighth [of that]. As for the rest of the produce, Abba Shmuel said: Enough that he can sell it and buy food for two meals.

### michna 6
This measure applies to priests and Levites and Israelites. If one wants to save some [e.g., for poor relatives], he may retain half and give half. If he has a small amount [less per poor person present than the amounts indicated], he places it before them, and they divide it between themselves.

### michna 7
One must not give [ Tzedakah ] to the poor who wander from place to place less than a loaf that is the price of a Pundion, when four Seah [of grain] cost a Sela. If he spends the night, one gives [bedding] supplies for the night. If he stays for Shabbat, one gives him food for three meals. One who has [enough] food for two meals must not take from the soup kitchen. [If he has enough] food for fourteen meals, he must not take from the charity box. And the charity box [funds] are collected by two people and distributed by three people.

### michna 8
One who has two hundred Zuz may not take Leket, Shikhechah, Peah or Ma'aser Ani. If he has one Dinar less than two hundred, even one thousand [people] simultaneously give him [a Dinar, he may take [them all]. If [his assets] are mortgaged to his creditor or his wife’s marriage contract, he may take. He is not obligated to sell his house or his [fine] clothes [in order to take agricultural gifts].

### michna 9
Someone who has fifty Zuz, and he uses them for business, he may not take. And anyone who does not need to take, but takes anyway, will not depart from the world until he will become dependent on others. And all who need to take, yet do not take, will not die from old age until he will [be enabled to] provide for others from his portion. Regarding this, scripture states, “Blessed is the man that relies on G-d, and G-d will be his security” (Jeremiah 17:7). [The same is true] for a judge who judges in absolute truth. And he who is neither lame, nor blind, nor crippled, yet he pretends to be one of these, he will not die of old age until he becomes like one of these, as it says, “Justice, justice shall you pursue.” (Deuteronomy 16:20) And every judge who takes a bribe and subverts the law, he will not die of old age until his eyes have dimmed, as it says, “And you shall not take a bribe, because a bribe blinds those who can see and understand, etc.” (Exodus 23:8)
