### michna 1
Rue, wild purple amaranth, purslane, mountain coriander, river celery, and arugula are all exempt from tithes and may be purchased from anybody during the Sabbatical year, because their counterparts are not guarded. Rabbi Yehudah says, mustard aftergrowths are permitted, since transgressors are not suspected concerning them. Rabbi Shimon says, all aftergrowths are permitted, except for cabbage aftergrowths, since they have no counterparts in field vegetation. The Sages say: all aftergrowths are prohibited.

### michna 2
There are three regions [delineated by] Bi'ur [requirement to destroy all Sabbatical produce when its season is finished]: Judah, Transjordan, and the Galilee. There are three subregions within each and every region. The upper Galilee, the lower Galilee, and the valley; From Kfar Chananya and above - all [of the land] that does not grow sycamores - is the upper Galilee; from Kfar Chananya and below - all [of the land] that does grow sycamores - is the lower Galilee. And the boundary of Tiberius - is the valley. And in Judah: the hill, the plain, and the valley. And the plain of Lod is like the plain of the south, and its hill is like the king's hill. From Beit Choron to the sea is one district.

### michna 3
Why did they delineate three regions? For they would eat in each [region] until the last of its [produce] was finished. Rabbi Shimon says: there are three regions only in Judah. But the other regions are all considered as the king's hill. And all of the regions are considered the same regarding [the end time of] olives and dates.

### michna 4
One may continue to eat [Sabbatical produce] on the basis of ownerless [produce not having yet been finished], but not on the basis of guarded produce. Rabbi Yosi permits even on the basis of guarded produce. One may eat on the basis of poor quality grain or on the basis of the second crop, but not on the basis of winter fruits. Rabbi Yehudah permits so long as the winter fruit began to ripen before the end of the summer [of the Sabbatical year].

### michna 5
One who pickles three kinds of vegetables in one jar: Rabbi Eliezer says they may be eaten because of the first [not having yet been finished]. But Rabbi Yehoshua says: even because of the last. Rabban Gamliel says: all whose species has finished from the field, that species requires Bi'ur from the jar. Rabbi Shimon says: all vegetables are regarded as one [species] in respect to Bi'ur. Purslane may be eaten until wild purslane are finished from the valley of Beit Netofa.

### michna 6
One who picks fresh grasses, [may eat them] until their sweetness has dried up. One who gathers dry [plants], [may eat them] until the second seasonal rain falls. Reed leaves and grape leaves may be eaten until they fall from their parents; but one who gathers [them] dry, [may eat them] until the second seasonal rain falls. Rabbi Akiva says, all of them [may be eaten] until the second seasonal rain falls.

### michna 7
Similarly, one who rents a house to another "until the rainy season": [this means] until the second seasonal rain falls. One who swears off benefit from another "until the rainy season": [this means] until the second seasonal rain falls. Until when may the poor enter into the orchards? Until the second seasonal rain falls. From when may one draw benefit and burn the straw and stubble of the Sabbatical year? From when the second seasonal rain falls.

### michna 8
If one possessed Sabbatical produce and the [time of] Bi'ur arrived, he may distribute three meals-worth of the produce to everyone [in his household]. The poor may continue to eat after the [time of] Bi'ur, but not the rich, according to Rabbi Yehudah. Rabbi Yosi says, both the poor and the rich may eat [from the fields] after the [time of] Bi'ur.

### michna 9
If one possessed produce of the Sabbatical year that came to him as an inheritance, or that was given to him as a gift; Rabbi Eliezer says it may be given to those who eat it. The Sages say: the transgressor may not benefit, but rather it may be sold to those who eat it, and the money should be distributed to all people. One who eats dough of the Sabbatical year before Challah [dough that must be set aside for the priest] has been taken from it, is liable to the death penalty.
