### michna 1
An important rule that they [the Sages] said regarding the Sabbatical year: anything that is specifically [considered] human food cannot be made into a plaster for humans, and it need not be said [that it cannot be made into a plaster] for animals. And anything that is not specifically [considered] human food can be made into a plaster for people but not for animals. And anything that is neither specifically [considered] human food nor animal food: [if] he intended it [at the time of picking] to be both human food and animal food, it takes on the stringencies of human food and the stringencies of animal food. [If] he intended it for wood, it is considered wood [and can therefore only be used to feed fire]. For example, Satureia Thymbra, hyssop, and thyme [can all be used either as food or as wood].

### michna 2
[Produce grown during] the Sabbatical year may be used for eating or for drinking or for anointing; for eating that which is normally eaten, and for anointing that which is normally used to smear. He may not anoint with wine or vinegar, but he may anoint with oil. And so too in [produce that is] Terumah [produce consecrated for priestly consumption] or Ma'aser Sheni [second tithe, which must be eaten in Jerusalem]. The [law of the] Sabbatical year is more lenient than them in that it[s produce] may be used to light a candle.

### michna 3
One may not sell fruit [grown during] the Sabbatical year, neither by size, nor by weight, nor by number, and not [even] figs by number, and not [even] vegetables by weight. The school of Shammai say: he may not even [sell produce] by bundles. And the school of Hillel say: that which is normally bundled [for eating] at home can be bundled in the market, like leek and Netz HeChalav [unknown plant].

### michna 4
One who says to his worker, "Take this Issar [specific unit of money] and pick a vegetable for me today," his payment is permitted. [If he said to him,] "Pick for me with this today," his payment is forbidden. [If] he bought a loaf from the baker for a Fundyon [specific unit of money, and said to him,] "When I pick vegetables from [my] field, I will bring them to you," [this form of payment is] permitted. If he bought [from the baker] without specifying [the form of payment], he may not pay him with money from Sabbatical year [produce] because one may not pay back a debt with money from Sabbatical year [produce].

### michna 5
[Money from Sabbatical year produce] may not be given to a well digger nor to the owner of a bathhouse nor to a barber nor to a captain of a ship. But it may be given to a well digger in exchange for a drink. And to all of them, he may give a free gift [of Sabbatical year produce].

### michna 6
Figs [grown during] the Sabbatical year may not be cut with a fig-cutter, but may be cut with a knife. Grapes [grown during the Sabbatical year] may not be stomped in a wine press, but may be stomped in a kneading trough. And olives may not be processed in an olive press or a small olive press, but he may crush and put them in a very small olive press. Rabbi Shimon says: He may even grind them in an olive press and then put them in a very small olive press.

### michna 7
One may not cook a vegetable [grown during] the Sabbatical year in oil that is Terumah, so that he will not cause it to become invalid. Rabbi Shimon permits this. The very last [item bought with the proceeds of selling Sabbatical produce] is seized by the laws of the Sabbatical year. And the [original] fruit itself is [still] forbidden [like other Sabbatical produce].

### michna 8
One may not buy slaves or land or impure animals with money [received in exchange for] Sabbatical [produce]. And if he bought [them], he must eat a corresponding amount [of other food as if it were Sabbatical produce]. One may not bring the bird sacrifices of Zavim [men who have an abnormal seminal discharge] or bird sacrifices of Zavot [women who have an abnormal vaginal discharge] or bird sacrifices of women who gave birth from money [received in exchange for] Sabbatical [produce]. And if he brought [them], he must eat a corresponding amount. One may not anoint vessels with oil [grown during] the Sabbatical year. And if he anointed, he must eat a corresponding amount.

### michna 9
Animal hide which is anointed in oil [grown during] the Sabbatical year, Rabbi Eliezer says: it must be lit on fire. And the Sages say: he must eat a corresponding amount [of other food as if it were Sabbatical produce]. They [the Sages] said in front of Rabbi Akiva: Rabbi Eliezer would say, "Animal hide which is anointed in oil [produced during] the Sabbatical year must be burned." He responded to them: Quiet! I will not tell you what Rabbi Eliezer says about this.

### michna 10
And they [the Sages] said another [law] in front of him [Rabbi Akiva]: Rabbi Eliezer would say, "One who eats the bread of Cuthites is like one who eats pig meat." He responded to them: Quiet! I will not tell you what Rabbi Eliezer says about this.

### michna 11
A bathhouse that is heated with straw or stubble [grown during] the Sabbatical year, one is allowed to bath in it. But if he is an important person [whose actions will be influential], he may not bathe [in it].
